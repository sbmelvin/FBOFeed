1.	Estimated Solicitation issue date is 17 November 2016 with an estimated closing/response date of January 4 2017.
It is the intention of DLA Aviation at Oklahoma City to allow a 45-Day Solicitation period for Boeing Rights Guard applicable acquisitions with days 1 through 15 being allotted to allow time for additional potential sources to submit requests for, and receive, the BRG Technical Data Package CD-ROM.  This additional time over-and-above the standard 30-day Solicitation timeframe is a courtesy and serves as constructive notice that it is the affirmative responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the FBO and quickly process requests for the BRG Technical Data Package CD-ROM and that Solicitation Closing Dates WILL NOT be extended for the sole-purpose to allow for additional time to propose.
2.	Request for Proposal #:  SPRTA1-17-R-0100

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></span>
<p>The explosion of social media and interactive internet services has revolutionized the Information Environment (IE), and fundamentally created a sensor system comprised of billions of citizens observing and reporting activities across the globe.  Additionally, global actors, both state and non-state, are using the same interactive internet system to plan and coordinate activities across the spectrum of operations.  Essentially, the internet has become an ubiquitous Command and Control (C2) and sensor system that impacts the United States (US) and its allies' missions around the globe, including Shaping activities, force protection, counter-terrorism, counter-Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), and a myriad of others.</p>
<p>In response, the Government has established the Secure Unclassified Network (SUNet): an off-Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN), For Official Use Only (FOUO)-accredited unclassified platform to enable the Department of Defense (DoD), US Government Interagency, and Coalition Partners to securely collaborate and share Publicly Available Information, FOUO data, analytics, and other enterprise services.  This platform enables mission partners to establish virtual enclaves, control access to those enclaves, and to acquire, develop, and deploy mission-specific data sets and analytics that can be shared across multiple enclaves or restricted based on mission requirements.</p>
<p>The Government intends to establish an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle(s) under which Task Orders (TO) may be issued to provide the requisite services for the establishment and maintenance of SUNet enclaves. The Government anticipates the duration of the IDIQ contract to be five (5) years. The objective of this effort is to develop SUNet Enclaves for mission specific requirements that include development of applications or analytics, as well as the integration of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and government off-the-shelf (GOTS) products with new data and collaboration features across US Government and foreign partner communities of interest.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to use FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.</p>

<p>The solicitation will be issued on or about August 11, 2015.</p>
<p>This is a 50% small business set-aside, please read the solicitation carefully.&nbsp; Only the non-set-aside portion is initially solicited and competed. The solicitation clauses and other information reflect only this reduced quantity. An award will first be made on the non-set-aside portion. The set-aside portion will then be negotiated with the lowest responsive small business concern who submitted an offer on this solicitation. The small business must agree to the price on the non-set-aside portion. If not, the set-aside portion is negotiated with the next low small business. This process continues until the entire set-aside quantity is awarded. The set-aside fails if no small business can meet the price on the non-set-aside portion. See FAR 19.502-3(c) for information regarding partial set-aside procedures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S. Government is pursuing a long-term, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with firm fixed pricing for the duration of a firm fixed price base period of three (3) years and zero (0) option years. The solicitation is for DLA managed consumables, for the procurement of certain part numbered items that cross-reference to National Stock Numbers (NSNs) identified in Section B of the solicitation. The items will be solicited using FAR Part 15 guidelines. There are two manufacturing sources, AM General, LLC (CAGE 34623) and Standard Bent Glass Corp. (CAGE 458W5); therefore, the acquisition will be limited to items manufactured by these manufacturers. Because there is only two manufacturing sources, the requirement is being procured with other than full and open competition in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, or in this case, a limited number of responsible sources, and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The statutory authority permitting this is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1). Offerors are not required to submit an offer on all items within the solicitation as each item will be procured on an "all or none" basis per NSN, and for the purpose of this solicitation, an NSN will be considered a Contract Line Item Number (CLIN).</p>
<p>The items to be procured are listed below.</p>

<DESC>Introduction/Purpose 

This market survey announcement is issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy section 3.2.1.2.1 Market Analysis. The purpose of this Market Survey is to seek and identify interest in the program and understand existing capabilities of the market. This will be accomplished by obtaining and assessing industry responses to specific market survey questions contained herein. 

Background 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement to provide automated Invoice Financial Management Services (IFMS). The current IFMS contract provides the FAA with turn-key services for the automated review and reconciliation of CLIN-based telecommunications invoices and other related services. A major focus of the IFMS contract is the review and reconciliation of invoices associated with the FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) contract. The FAA has decided to extend the FTI contract to 2022, but the IFMS contract currently expires at the end of October 2017. To ensure no disruption to the automated invoice review and reconciliation functions, the FAA is performing market research of industry capabilities to provide the required services.
A contract line item number (CLIN) is a billing unit frequently used on Government contracts for cost recovery. The format of CLINs is generally contract-specific. CLINs have a defined unit price. On an individual monthly invoice, the same CLIN may be invoiced in association with multiple telecommunications services. The invoiced quantity is defined on a per-service basis by the associated service order.  There can be functional relationships between CLINs based on the corresponding network elements, i.e., the presence of one type of CLIN on the invoice may necessitate or preclude the presence of another CLIN on the invoice.

Specific Questions:

1A. Does your firm perform automated review and reconciliation of CLIN-based telecommunications invoices? 
Note:  If the answer to Question 1A is No, Questions 1B, 1C, 1D and all parts of Questions 2 and 3 are not applicable. 
1B. What is the maximum number of telecommunications services you have processed on a single monthly invoice for a particular client? 
1C. What is the maximum number of unique CLINs you have processed on a single monthly invoice for a particular client? 
1D. What is the maximum dollar value of a single monthly invoice you have processed for a particular client?
2A. Do the invoices processed by your firm include credits for the violation of Service Level Agreement (SLA) conditions? If so,
2B. What is the maximum number of SLA conditions processed for a particular client?
Note:  An example of an SLA condition is:  If a service outage is not restored within n minutes, an invoice credit of x% of the monthly recurring charge for the service must be provided on the next invoice.
3A. What best describes the tool your firm has used to perform automated review and reconciliation of telecommunications invoices? If your firm has used different tools for different clients, please base your response on the tool you feel is most relevant to the application described in the Background section. 
i.	Custom developed 
ii.	Modified version of a proprietary tool
iii.	Modified version of a commercial-off the shelf (COTS) product.  Name of COTS product: ________
iv.	None of the above. Explanation: _____________________________________________________
3B. If your response to 3A is ii or iii, please provide an estimate of the percentage of modifications required and provide the basis for the percentage, e.g., lines of code, function points, etc. Also, what was the cost (to the client) and amount of time required to complete the modifications?
3C. Does your firm provide a secure, web-accessible user interface for clients to access, run queries, and generate custom and ad hoc reports on the invoice source data and the results of the invoice processing, e.g., discrepancies identified?
4A. Does your firm perform automated generation of expensing recommendations between telecommunications invoice charges and accounting codes that should be used to pay the charges? If so,
4B. What is the maximum number of active accounting codes tracked for a particular client?
4C. What is the maximum number of expensing rules for a particular client?
Note:  An example of an expensing rule is:   If amendments or change orders have been processed that specify a new funding source that replaces funding sources cited on prior versions of the service order, charges shall be expensed against the accounting code specified on the latest revision of the service order.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE AND SAVE-THE-DATE-------<br /><br />A full solicitation is anticipated with a yet-to-be-determined posting date. This notice will be amended to post the solicitation and its attachments. The purpose of this early pre-solicitation is to alert interested parties to a ***SITE VISIT*** occurring in NOVEMBER 2016.
<p>The solicitation will be set-aside at least to small business and may be further set aside to a specific type of small business concern.</p>
<p>Project Description:<br />The objective of this project is to hand thin and pile standing conifer trees and some pre-existing down woody material as part of ongoing aspen, oak, and pine enhancement projects. The project is comprised of 12 units totaling 60 acres. 7 of these units have had commercial conifer trees and biomass removed via timber sales within the limits of mechanical operability. The remaining 5 units have not received any recent treatment.<br />In all units: Live White fir, Incense cedar, Red fir, and Lodgepole pine trees within a specified diameter breast height (DBH) range are to be felled. These DBH ranges are shown by unit in the attached Table 1. In addition to felling trees within specified diameter ranges, other cut trees up to 29.9 inches will be designated for cutting using green marking paint. These additional cut trees are located in direct proximity to aspen trees. Hardwoods, Ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine, Sugar pine, Western white pine, and Douglas fir trees are not to be cut unless painted with a green band at DBH. Contractors shall conduct operations so as not to unnecessarily damage residual leave trees. Where boles of cut trees taper to 10 inches in diameter or less, they shall be cut into segments that are no longer than 6 feet in length and piled. Bole material that is greater than 10 inches in diameter shall be left in place on the ground and is not to be piled.<br />All activity created material between 2 and 10 inches in diameter shall be piled, as well as all limbs/branches of cut trees greater than 0.5 inches in diameter. All pre-existing down woody material between 2 and 10 inches in diameter shall be piled except material on logging skid trails and landings. Piles may not be placed within aspen stands, wetlands, stream channels, or meadows and must be placed away from residual live conifers and hardwoods.</p>
<p>Access:<br />The project area is located at two main sites: One unit is located on the east side of Philbrook Reservoir while the remaining 11 units are found to the north, both in and adjacent to Coon Hollow. The project units range from 48 to 54 miles from the Almanor Ranger District Office; 33 miles of which are travelled via Highway 36 West and Highway 32 West. The units are then accessed via County and Forest Service roads. Most of the units can be directly accessed from the road, however, some require a walk-in of 0.1 to 0.4 miles.</p>
<p>Estimated start date:<br />June 1, 2017. Actual start date may vary due to weather and ground conditions. Contract time has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Road Conditions to All Units:<br />The specified roads are accessible by a four-wheel drive vehicle when road conditions are favorable. Inaccessibility due to snow, fallen trees, mudslides, or washouts may occur.</p>
<p>***Scheduled Site Visit:<br />A site visit is scheduled for November 14, 2016 at 8:00 AM Pacific Time, weather permitting, starting at the Almanor Ranger District Office at 900 E Highway 36, Chester, CA 96020. The Site Visit Point of Contact is Jesse Braley. Jesse can be contacted at jessedbraley@fs.fed.us or (530) 258-5167. It is highly recommended that interested parties contact Mr. Braley to communicate intent to attend the site visit, and to provide contact information, so that timely communication may occur should the site visit need to be rescheduled.***</p>

If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the U.S. Navy Aviation Supply Office Source Approval Information Brochure: http://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS - P at (215) 697-4243.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS - P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>Introduction:
<p><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) was designated by the Secretary to implement and administer the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act. The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (Patient Safety Act) and its regulations (the Patient Safety Rule) authorized the creation of Patient Safety Organizations (PSOs), which collect, aggregate, and analyze confidential and privileged information regarding the quality and safety of healthcare. The goals of the Patient Safety Act are to encourage the expansion of voluntary, provider-driven initiatives to improve the quality and safety of health care; to promote rapid learning about the underlying causes of risks and harms in the delivery of health care; and, to share those findings widely, thus, speeding the pace of improvement. The Patient Safety Act also authorizes AHRQ to facilitate the development of a Network of Patient Safety Databases (NPSD), to which PSOs can voluntarily contribute non-identifiable patient safety event information. The NPSD will receive, analyze, and report on non-identifiable, aggregated patient safety event information which will be included in AHRQ's annual National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Report (QDR). AHRQ understood the complexity of ensuring that information submitted to the NPSD was non-identifiable and the costs associated with adherence to the confidentiality provisions of the Patient Safety Rule. Therefore, AHRQ established the PSO Privacy Protection Center (PSOPPC) to assist PSOs and others with meeting the statutory requirement that patient safety event information be made non-identifiable prior to sending to the NPSD. The PSOPPC will receive patient safety information in a standardized format (AHRQ Common Formats) and render it non-identifiable before transmitting it safely and efficiently to the NPSD.</p>
<p>The Patient Safety Rule requires PSOs, to the extent practical and appropriate, to collect patient safety event data from providers in a standardized manner. AHRQ's common definitions, data elements, and reporting formats are known as Common Formats. The PSOPPC only accepts data represented as AHRQ's Common Formats. The PSO also delivers technical assistance to PSOs on the use of AHRQ's Common Formats.</p>
<p>The Common Formats include event descriptions, specifications for patient safety aggregate reports, delineation of data elements to be collected for different types of events, and technical specifications for electronic data collection and reporting. The technical specifications promote standardization of collected patient safety event information by stipulating rules for data collection and submission. The PSOPPC maintains the Common Formats and the technical specifications. The Common Formats and the associated technical specifications are available on the PSOPPC Web Site (www.psoppc.org). Full details of the Patient Safety Act and Patient Safety Rule can be found at www.pso.ahrq.gov.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>AHRQ is seeking qualified and experienced organizations that are able to optimize their technical and management resources, creativity and flexibility to achieve the Agency goals. Qualified organizations must have substantial experience with: development of large scale, cloud-based database systems for patient safety and healthcare quality data; development of standardized definitions, data elements and reporting formats for patient safety event reporting; statistical analysis expertise in non-identification methods; logistical support for meetings of approximately 180 attendees; and the ability to receive, process, and, maintain data at FIPS category moderate.</p>
<p>In order to meet AHRQ's objectives, these are the general requirements of this contract: provide guidance to PSOs in the use of Common Formats; rendering patient safety event information non-identifiable; track and maintain data use agreement with PSOs; establish software certification processes; provide technical assistance to PSOs including training and outreach; establish project management strategies for rendering Information Technology architect, infrastructure, and enterprise solutions; implement a data visualization application; conduct data analyses; and implement a transition plan for smooth operation of the PSOPPC and NPSD Systems without any problems or interruption of operations during the transition period.</p>
<p>Other requirements that are specific to both Systems are defined below:</p>
<p>PSOPPC System<br />The scope of this project's requirements for the PSOPPC System is to make sure data submission and data flow from the PSO to the PSOPPC System are smooth and uninterrupted; collaborate with PSOs to receive patient safety and quality data and to render patient safety work product non-identifiable in compliance with requirements of the Patient Safety Rule (Section 3.212); and, transfer the non-identifiable data/information securely and efficiently to the NPSD System.</p>
<p>NPSD System<br />One of the requirements is to develop the NPSD System and implement it in accordance to the HHS and AHRQ IT regulations. Other requirements identified are: conduct data analysis; convert analyses into useful information; and, develop periodic reports and dashboards to provide a complete assessment of adverse events based on the non-identifiable analyses.</p>

<CONTACT>Rachel Ashton via email at Rachel.a.ashton@navy.mil
<DESC>This notice does NOT constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid.  The intent of this notice is to identify potential offerors for market research purposes.

ROICC Camp Lejeune is seeking responses from interested firms that qualify as a U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) small business concerns capable of performing minor construction projects, to include new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, and repair type work, at the Camp Lejeune Naval Hospital, North Carolina.  The purpose of this notice is to identify sources that have specific, specialized experience with minor construction type services in a hospital environment.  

The Government contemplates an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Job Order Contract to provide Design-Bid-Build and Design-Build minor construction services for the Camp Lejeune Naval Hospital.
  

The procurement method to be utilized is FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this potential procurement is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction Contractors, with a corresponding small business size standard of $36.5 million.

It is anticipated that the contract performance period will include one (1) year basic period, and two (2) one year option periods.  The maximum ordering capacity will not exceed $4 million.  Task orders will be firm fixed price and will predominately be in dollar value from $5,000 to $150,000; however, the Government may elect to issue task orders of a higher or lower dollar value.
  The predominant dollar value of each project will be less than $50,000.  Only the base period of the contract will offer a minimum guarantee.

Firms will be expected to provide and maintain, during the entire performance of the contract, at least the kinds and minimum amounts of insurance required for work on a Government Installation, in accordance with FAR Clause 52.228-5.  The minimum amounts, as specified in FAR subpart 28.306 are as follows: Workers Compensation and Employers Liability ($100,000); General Liability ($500,000 per occurrence/$50,000 per occurrence for property damage); Automobile Liability ($200,000 per person/$500,000 per occurrence for bodily injury/$20,000 per occurrence for property damage).

This contemplated action would be a new procurement.
  It does not replace an existing contract.  No prior contract information exists.  

Interested parties should provide a brief capabilities statement (no more than three pages in length, single-spaced, 10 point font minimum) demonstrating ability to perform the services described above.  The capabilities statement shall address, as a minimum, the following information as applicable:

(1)	Company profile to include number of employees, office location(s), DUNS number, CAGE Code, and statement regarding 8(a) status.

(2)	Relevant Experience:  Up to five (5) example projects which best demonstrate the companys experience relative to the type of work described in this notice and specific to managing several projects in the dollar range specified simultaneously.
  Example projects should be representative of NAICS 236220, the description above, and be similar in size, scope, and complexity to this requirement.  Include in the submitted information: the contract number, indication of whether a prime or subcontractor, contact value, square footage, Government/Agency point of contact and current telephone number, and a brief description to sufficiently demonstrate your firms experience with the types of work described in the work description above.  

(3)	Specific relevant experience in a hospital environment. 

(4)	Statement regarding Bonding Capabilities.

(5)	Intended percentage of work to be subcontracted.

The capabilities statement shall be provided via email to rachel.a.ashton@navy.mil with the following subject:  Hospital JOC Sources Sought (Company Name).
  Submissions shall be received no later than close of business on November 11, 2016.  Questions or concerns may be submitted to the email address above.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the <strong>Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP)</strong> in November.
<p><br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its <strong>Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP)</strong>, located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The <strong>AAAP </strong>will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects. The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'. Interested parties must go to the <strong>AAAP </strong>website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register. Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the <strong>AAAP </strong>homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the <strong>AAAP </strong>website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p>The Open Period for November* is November 1, 2016 to November 7, 2016, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement. The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements. Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov). Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the <strong>AAAP </strong>website. During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.</p>

<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - Tulsa District has been tasked to solicit for and award conversion of overhead to underground, Circuit 1, and airfield lighting at Sheppard AFB. Proposed project will be one of two options, 1) a competitive, firm-fixed price, design/build contract procured in accordance with FAR 15, Negotiated Procurement using "Best Value" trade-off process, or 2) a negotiated task order on an existing indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity contract. The type of set-aside decision to be issued will depend upon the capabilities of the responses to this synopsis.<br /><br />The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of industry, to include the Small Business Community: Small Business, Section 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUB-Zone), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB). The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of responsible contractors. Small business, Section 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB and WOSB businesses are highly encouraged to participate.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking qualified, experienced sources capable of performing the following: Replace all existing primary and secondary O/H and U/G electrical distribution lines serving Circuit 1 (approximately total 5.5 miles) with underground lines in an encased concrete conduit. Replace all existing U/G electrical distribution lines and associated lightning protection/grounding components serving the airfield. All distribution line replacement included in this project includes associated appurtenances such as transformers, switches, conduit, duct bank, and manholes. If feasible, reutilize existing manholes, conduit, and duct bank; provide new where needed. Where existing O/H line is replaced with U/G, remove existing electrical poles and crossarms, pole-mounted transformers, and pole-mounted lights; replace transformers with appropriate pad-mounted equivalent. Replace existing pad-mounted transformers. Replace street lights (total number 30) as indicated by project design drawings.<br />Replace all existing U/G electrical distribution lines and associated lightning protection/grounding components serving the airfield. Cables should be sheathed in LLDPE due to project location in a 100-year floodplain.<br />Replace copper airfield lighting control cable with fiber optic and all appurtenances to include required lightning protection/grounding components. Replace all existing constant current regulators (CCR) with FAA AC 150/5345-10G compliant ferrorresonant CCRs. Reconfigure existing duct bank supporting the airfield lighting system to comply with UFC 3-535-01, Table 12.1 beginning at the point of origin, the main utility vault, and continuing past the control tower eastward to the airfield. Ensure that medium voltage and high voltage cables are ducted separately. Reroute the path of the airfield control cable to ensure complete segregation from any power cables. Utilize comm ducts where possible to facilitate reconfiguration. When the extent of the existing comm ducting is reached the control cable must be placed in a new dedicated duct bank. Provide back-up airfield lighting control system to the airfield operations center via a programmable logic controller (PLC).<br />Repair main airfield utility vault in accordance with UFC 3-535-01, 12-1.8. Replace existing 500kV emergency backup generator (E/G) and main service switch for UFC compliance. Reconfigure vault interior to achieve adequate spacing between CCRs for high voltage safety.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), Health Readiness Contracting Office (HRCO) on behalf of the Department of the Army, has developed this Request for Information (RFI) to solicit market research information from industry to assist with analysis of a Government requirement and provide commercial insight on performance-based solutions, best practices, possible contractual arrangements, and potential issues. The current requirement was solicited under a competitive set-aside under the Small Business Administration's 8(a) Business Development Program.
<p><br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a solicitation, or an indication the HRCO will contract for the items contained in the RFI. This RFI is part of a Government market research effort to determine the scope of industry capabilities and interest and will be treated as information only. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responses to the RFI are only being sought from vendors that are in the 8(a) program. Responses to this RFI are strictly voluntary and the Government will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this RFI. Responses to this RFI will not be returned and respondents will not be notified of the result of the review. If a Solicitation is issued, it will be announced on the Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fbo.gov at a later date, and all interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from any response to this announcement. This RFI does not restrict the Government's acquisition approach on a future solicitation.</p>
<p>The Government's requirement is to obtain contractor dedicated resources for the MEDCOM in support of the Neuro-Cognitive Assessment Testing (NCAT) Program Office. The NCAT Program is an existing Department of Defense (DoD) program designed to provide baseline neuro-cognitive testing to deploying service members of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached to this announcement.</p>
<p>The Government desires that respondents offer their experience and recommendations on the following questions and issues related to the NCAT requirements of the DoD. When addressing these items, respondents should consider the size and scope of the requirement, which includes providing services at the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs), listed in Exhibits C, D, and E.</p>
<p>1. What are the commercially available neuro-cognitive assessments that can be administered both individually and in group settings? <br /><br />2. What is the industry practice for a quality control plan to ensure quality results when testing in groups and individually? What does your company provide? What are the benefits of your approach?<br /><br />3. Are there any issues in the commercial marketplace that the Government should be aware of i.e. other testing types, market conditions, or alternatives to computerized testing that can be given in a group setting?<br /><br />4. Is there a national organization that governs and provides policy and procedures for neuro-cognitive assessments?<br /><br />5. Does your business perform these types of services under any Federal Supply Schedule? If so what is your schedule number?<br /><br />6. Are there any available subcontracting opportunities?<br /><br />7. Can this requirement be firm fixed price? If not what are the recommended contract types (cost, time and materials)?<br /><br />8. Are there generally used industry pricing arrangements for these types of services? If so, please provide them.<br /><br />9. What types of positions are typically used to perform these types of services (e.g., clerk, computer operator, computer support technician)?<br /><br />10. Please provide a description of your experience with providing the required service. Indicate whether you have provided these services at CONUS and/or OCONUS locations.<br /><br />11. Does the attached Performance Work Statement and Exhibits provide sufficient detailed information for your company to have a clear understanding of the requirement?<br /><br />12. Are there any new standards for this particular testing being conducted in the commercial market?<br /><br />13. Is your business Central Contractor Registered (CCR) and current in the database?<br /><br />14. Is your business in the 8(a) program? If so, please list your start and exits dates. What is your company size and category i.e.; Small Business, HUBZone, 8a under the proposed NAICS code 541611?</p>
<p>Respondents to this RFI should describe their interest and ability to perform the requirements summarized within this notice. Responses should address the company's experience in providing similar services to medical facilities including commercial, military, or other federal Government hospitals and treatment facilities. When describing this past experience, a brief description of the size, scope, and complexity of the requirement and the contracting vehicle should be provided. To be of greatest value, responses should address the aforementioned questions and issues. Responses should contain Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, Phone Number, Fax Number, CAGE Code, Size of Business pursuant to NAICS code 541611 (size standard $15,000,000) and GSA contract number, if any. Reponses should be e-mailed to the point of contact identified in the below section.</p>
<p>Responses should be formatted as either MS Word (.doc) or Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf) and should be limited to a maximum of ten (10) pages. Proprietary/Competition Sensitive information (appropriately marked) will be protected from disclosure to the greatest extent practical; however, it is preferred that respondents do not provide proprietary or otherwise restricted responses. Responses should be submitted no later than 3:00 PM CDST, November 18, 2016. No faxes, courier delivered, or telephone inquiries/submissions will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: Prolonged Field Care Training for Medical Simulation &amp; Training Systems
<p>KEY DATES<br />Response Date: 18 November 2016 (4:00 PM, Eastern Time)</p>
<p>ISSUED BY<br />The Joint Program Committee-1, United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is for market research, information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of The Joint Program Committee 1- Medical Simulation and Information Sciences Research Program (JPC-1) or the US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA). The JPC1 - Medical Simulation and Information Sciences Research Program (MSISRP) was established in fiscal year 2010 (FY10) to provide programmatic funding recommendations for Department of Defense (DOD) Health Affairs (HA) medical research, development, testing, and evaluation dollars related to medical training and education efforts to advance the development and integration of simulation-based training programs. This RFI seeks information regarding simulation training of prolonged field care (PFC) scenarios in which prehospital care provided under situations where doctrinal medical evacuation timelines are not met and teams are required to stabilize and treat patients longer at the point of care setting. The RFI seeks information from respondents to provide information regarding development of PFC designs, models, and simulation systems to support PFC training and education.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>This RFI is seeking organizations researching, developing, and offering a modeling and simulation system(s) for use in military medical education and training that extends beyond initial trauma care but is limited by evacuation options due to potential unlimited reasons.  Prolonged Field Care includes medical care applied beyond doctrinal planning timelines and is not limited to battle injury training.  Evidence collected from data-driven casualty estimations and disease or non-battle injury/battle injury rates are strongly encouraged for use to inform what injuries / pathologies need to be considered to be trained using medical simulation system(s). Work in this area should contribute to updating current or creating new military medical education and training materials or to develop and evaluate commercial off-the-shelf or new and/or integrated medical simulation systems.</p>
<p>The RFI is seeking interoperable, integrated, and open source/architecture systems that address the level of provider at a minimum of Role 1 and Role 2.  Role 1 is integral medical support or allocated to a small unit, and will include the capabilities for providing first aid, immediate lifesaving measures, and triage. Role 2 is typically at larger unit levels, usually of Brigade or larger size, though it may be provided farther forward, depending upon the operational requirements. Although not always, Role 2 may support surgical capabilities with the capabilities to perform emergency surgery and essential post-operative management.<br />This market research may assist with the further development and/or refinement of potential future announcements or solicitations.  Information will be reviewed pursuant to consideration for the development of future Requests for Proposal (RFP) or Announcements for potential research, development, and integration of technologies identified in this RFI.</p>
<p>Objectives<br />The objectives of this RFI are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull;	To identify developed simulation systems/models that are open source/open architecture to allow for future, yet-to-be-developed tools and systems to be inserted/integrated into a prolonged field care model / simulation system.<br />&bull;	To identify developed simulation systems/models designs that include the Physician, Physician Assistant, and Nursing populations that could represent scenarios in PFC environments.<br />&bull;	To identify developed simulation systems that can quickly incorporate accurate and appropriate environmental changes (heat/cold, dry/humid, mountainous/desert/ocean, etc.), team performance training, and different diseases/pathologies. <br />&bull;	To identify developed simulation/models of PFC within continuum of care training scenarios which needs to proceed until a successful handoff has been made with the next appropriate level of care no matter the duration involved for evacuation.<br />&bull;	To identify developed simulation/models of PFC that incorporate the full mission profile to ensure all aspects of mission are integrated to include technical rescues, insertion techniques, and tactical considerations and incorporating as many of the medical care military providers.<br />&bull;	To identify developed simulation/models of PFC that incorporate currently used medical instruments, tools, pharmaceuticals, natural remedies indigenous to the respective environment and products as well as identified emerging technologies that will enable more robust care to be provided closer to point of injury.<br />&bull;	To identify developed simulation/models of PFC that model morbidity and mortality based on skill level.  It is recommended that "advancement" or progression of injury, illness, or disease should be supported by an open source / architecture public physiology engine [platform].</p>
<p>Relevance<br />The information provided must be relevant to the following areas:</p>
<p>1.	Information must be relevant to, but not ALL exclusive to a military medical personnel population.<br />2.	Information must be relevant to medical personnel and must be applicable in one or more to the potential military medical education and training applications: Role 1: First Responder Care; Role 2: Forward Resuscitative Care; Role 3: Theater hospital care; Role 4: Overseas Definitive Care; &amp; Role 5: U.S. Definitive Care.  <br />3.	Information must be relevant to ruggedness, robustness, durability, longevity, portability, mobility, various environmental exposure, safety, and modularity. <br />4.	Information must be relevant to components of the accuracy, precision, power utilization, or if the system is tethered /non-tethered.</p>
<p>RESEARCH</p>
<p>INFORMATION REQUESTED<br />Information is requested on product technologies or proposed studies that are consistent with the identified Objectives and Areas of Relevance listed of this RFI and are related to any of the following areas.  Responses to this RFI must specifically and clearly address any or all of the topics in the following three sections.</p>
<p>Section 1<br />Information is requested pertaining to the categories listed in Relevance regarding existing, leading-edge products and/or services related to the Objectives of this RFI.</p>

<SUBJECT>Research, Integration, and Development of Integumentary [Skin] System for Simulation Training and Education
<SOLNBR>W23RYXRIDISRFI1
<RESPDATE>111616
<CONTACT>Jesse Hoffman, Email jesse.m.hoffman2.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is targeted at organizations researching, developing, and offering integumentary simulation systems with physiological tissue characteristic and behavior measurements that will be integrated with a flexible and modular mannequin concept, such as the Advanced Modular Manikin (AMM), as well as future modular part-task training and education simulation systems which have yet to be developed. Organizations responding to this RFI must also provide design integration with an open source/architecture physiology research engine platform for data and information to and from the integumentary simulation system. The RFI encourages those working with synthetic materials, polymers, micro-technologies (such as micro-fluidic solutions), those that have researched measuring tissue properties or has access to such data / information, and those that have detailed understanding on physiological responsiveness of human tissues.
<p><br />Concentration on acute / traumatic injuries, ones that are representative of military injuries as well as burns, frostbite, and infectious diseases to name a few should be strongly considered. However, additional pathologies should be included in the RFI such as dermatology pathologies, autoimmune diseases, and other common infectious diseases that nearly any one could contract in order to diversify the capabilities of the simulated integumentary system.</p>
<p><br />The Integrated Skin RFI is intentionally broad for the purposes of disrupting the market by allowing the organization to develop a simulated integumentary system for integration / incorporation into current and future mannequin-based / part-task simulation training and education system. The intended use of an integumentary simulation system is for nearly any type of training anywhere along the continuum of care and be used in austere environments. The integumentary simulation system should incorporate "autonomous healing" of punctures, cuts into the material, and one that accurately, appropriately acts and responds analogous to human integumentary based upon physiological tissue properties and behavioral characteristics. This market research may assist with the further development and/or refinement of potential future announcements or solicitations. Information will be reviewed pursuant to consideration for the development of future Requests for Proposals (RFP) or Announcements for development of products or areas of research identified in this RFI.</p>

<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
<p>FactSet Research Systems - SS-OFR-17-003</p>
<p>The Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service), on behalf of the Office of Financial Research (OFR) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), intends to make award to FactSet Research Systems Inc., 601 Merritt 7, Norwalk, CT, 06851-1091 on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, for Subscription Services.</p>
<p>The Office of Financial Research (OFR) has a need to obtain data regarding trade credit networks and their associated supply chain in order to deepen understanding of the propagation of financial shocks in credit chains. In particular OFR needs data regarding trade credit networks between industrial firms through which banks may be interconnected. The supply chain credit and financing relationships lend themselves best to analysis when looking at entire sectors or the entire economy. OFR requires bulk downloads of financial and credit information on thousands of firms within a given sector. Lengthy historical information which covers at least the time period before the recession of 2007 to 2009 is also required by OFR in order to perform the necessary longitudinal analysis which examines financial shocks to credit chains to forecast future shocks.</p>
<p>Through Market research FactSet Revere Supply Chain dataset has been found to be the only source to the historical breadth of information (2003-2016) compiled from both the SEC 10 K filings and relationship data from published reports and social media coupled with bulk download capability of a dataset comprised of over 20,000 industrial firms. The entire FactSet Revere Supply Chain dataset can be downloaded at once (all 20,000 + firms) and sorted for comparative analysis by sector, industry and other analyst selected criteria and is the only source found to offer this. Only FactSet Revere Supply Chain dataset allows for bulk downloads over a long historical period and would be the only dataset that would make the analysis feasible to forecast credit shocks to the supply chain after the recession of 2007 to 2009.</p>
<p>NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE. A request for more information, or a copy of the solicitation, will not be considered an affirmative response to this Special Notice. Telephone responses or inquiries to this Special Notice will NOT be accepted.</p>
<p>Fiscal Service will consider written responses received no later than 14:00 (2:00 PM EST) November 14, 2016. Responses must be submitted electronically to purchasing@fiscal.treasury.gov, Attn: RG/BB.REF SS-OFR-17-003. Responses must include sufficient evidence that clearly shows the vendor is capable of providing the requested requirement. If no written response is received that clearly demonstrates an ability to meet all requirements, is more advantageous to the Government, and is received by the aforementioned deadline, Fiscal Service shall make award on a sole source basis to FactSet Research Systems.</p>
<p>Qualified contractors must provide the following:</p>
<p>1. The name and location of your company, contact information, and identify your business size (Large Business, Small Business, Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, HubZone, etc.). Please ensure contact information includes the name of the point of contact, email address, and telephone number should the Government have questions regarding individual responses.</p>
<p>2. Whether your services are available through a Government contract vehicle or Open Market.</p>
<p>3. A brief capabilities statement (not to exceed 5 pages) that includes a description of your company's standard line of business, as well as a list of customers your company currently provides these products/services for.</p>
<p>4. DUNS Number.</p>
<p>The following file extensions are not allowable and application materials/data submitted with these extensions cannot be considered:</p>
<p>.bat, .cmd, .com, .exe, .pif, .rar, .scr, .vbs, .hta, .cpl, and .zip files.</p>
<p>Microsoft Office compatible documents are acceptable.</p>
<p>No other information regarding this Special Notice will be provided at this time.</p>
<p>This notice does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. All firms responding to this notice are advised that their response is not a request that will be considered for contract award. All interested parties will be required to respond to any resultant solicitation separately from their response to this notice.</p>

Each Medical Center is responsible for storing the product to use as indicated by the product s labeling.  Once used, the Medical Center orders a replacement, and is invoiced at the agreed upon price for the replacement product. 
NOTE: The individual Medical Centers will have the responsibility for determining the product(s) that will be utilized from the entire product line.  If a Medical Center determines that a patient s circumstance warrants use of a product that is unavailable from the Contractor product line, the Medical Center will be free to use another contract or if needed, a non-contract source to meet the particular need.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with FEI Company located at 5350 NE Dawson Creek Drive, Hillsboro, OR 97124 to provide an immersion lens capable of being built into an FEI Apreo LV FEG Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). <br /><br />The sole source justification is based on the following:  NIST recently purchased an FEI Apreo SEM through a competitive acquisition.  After the award of the microscope system to FEI, NIST became aware of a newly released immersion lens (FEI Part Number 1088336) manufactured by FEI which would provide an additional magnetic objective lens to the overall SEM system which will increase the low voltage resolution to 1.0 nm at 1kV without requiring beam acceleration, increase the high vacuum resolution to 0.9 nm at 15kV and improve detection capabilities by applying energy filtering.  The improved resolution and detection capabilities will allow for more exact analyses of materials and increased range of image resolution. <br /><br />Because of the nature of the immersion lens in the overall SEM system, it will need to be incorporated into the Apreo SEM at the time of manufacture and cannot be added to the SEM after the base system is manufactured as an add-on or third party accessory. <br /><br />Market research has shown that FEI Company is the only manufacturer of an immersion lens compatible with the Apreo SEM system.  Additionally, FEI Company is the only company capable of incorporating the immersion lens into the Apreo SEM system at the time of manufacture. <br /><br />Given these facts, the preferred vendor, FEI Company is the only source reasonably available to provide and install the immersion lens. <br /><br />The resulting purchase order will be a Firm Fixed Price purchase order. The NAICS Code is 334516 with a size standard of 1,000 employees. <br /><br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties who regard themselves as capable of fulfilling these requirements are invited to submit responses to the Government for consideration. Responses received by 11:00 am EST November 14th 2016 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT<br />The US Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division, Simplified Acquisition Branch intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Intelligent Systems Automation, Inc., 1156 Bowman Rd., Suite 200, Mt. Pleasant, SC 29464, using the procedures in FAR Part 13, to provide the upgrade of the Integrated Vessel Management Control (IVMC) aboard the NOAA ship Nancy Foster. The IVMC on the Nancy Foster is original American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) equipment and software running on an out of date operating system and many of the components are no longer supported.  The Input/Output (I/O) modules in the engine room (6 total) were replaced with supportable units in 2012.  The remaining I/O modules were deferred.  Due to the long period between Phase I and the current work more of the system has become outdated which requires additional work, such as hardware, beyond the remaining I/O modules.  The hardware, system programming, software, and operating system upgrades are needed to be completed to maintain the vessel in compliance with Automated Centralize Control (ACC) for ABS/USCG.  Intelligent Systems Automation (ISA) completed the initial upgrade and is the only known source to complete the final upgrade due to interoperability concerns with ABS rules in order to maintain its ACC classification.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), Only one responsible source.
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 811310 with a business size standard of $7.5M. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. A statement of capabilities must be received by 2:00 p.m., November 10, 2016. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required services. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to lynne.phipps@noaa.gov by 2:00 p.m., November 10, 2016.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), Contracting Division, Systems Section (DITCO/PL8223), 2300 East Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5406, intends to issue a sole source award to Quark Security, Inc. to provide licenses for 1,000 Department of Defense (DoD) Mobility Classified Capability (DMCC) Integrated Commercial Solution (ICS) Secret (DMCC-S) devices.
<p>These licenses must be purchased through Quark Security, Inc. to continue the existing National Security Administration (NSA) approved secure baseline configuration of the classified capability on the device. The DMCC ICS device baseline configurations ensure interoperability amongst the DMCC components providing the following capabilities; device integrity, secure browsing, secure email, secure voice, internet protocol security, virtual private network connectivity, policy enforcement and mobile device management. The license required to meet the DMCC secure browsing capability is specific to the Quark Security Shield application. This application provides a NSA required encryption, managing the device security policies, actively monitoring threats to the device and providing a robust security layer to the entire device, enabling the secure browsing.</p>
<p>The DMCC is a joint effort between the DISA and the NSA. In June 2014, the NSA competitively awarded integration contract, H98230-14-C-0596, to meet the DMCC Program needs. In addition to providing DISA with secure DMCC-S devices, this contract provided for the Quark Security Shield application and associated licensing. However, these licenses expire 30 November 2015 and must be renewed to prevent Information Assurance (IA) security gaps on the device. The Quark license ensures the registered DMCC-S user's device can operate securely.</p>
<p>Quark Security Shield is the only mobile application able to provide device security management and encryption capability, mandated by NSA, to maintain the secure baseline configuration of the classified capability on the device. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>All responsible sources will be considered in evaluating the determination to issue a sole-source contract. Quotations or proposals received in response to this notice cannot be accepted since this synopsis cannot be considered a request for quote or a request for proposal.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to award a firm-fixed price contract in November 2015 with a period of performance of one year.</p>

<p>Questions in regards to this solicitation shall be submitted in writing by either email, fax or mail no later than November 7, 2016, 11:00am CST.</p>
<p>A security pre-clearance must be performed for any employees referred to IHS through this contract.</p>
<p>Fingerprints must be completed and adjudicated prior to services being performed under this contract.</p>
<p>No contract award shall be made to any vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov throughout the duration of the contract. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the acquisition official if there is a change in provider.</p>
<p>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov.

During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your proposal must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<p>1852.215-84 OMBUDSMAN. (NOV 2011)<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and contractors during the preaward and postaward phases of this<br />acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source<br />of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer, the Source Evaluation Board, or the selection official. Further, the<br />ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or<br />the adjudication of formal contract disputes. Therefore, before consulting with an ombudsman,<br />interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or<br />recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.</p>
<p>(b) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties may contact the<br />installation ombudsman, whose name, address, telephone number, facsimile number, and email<br />address may be found at: http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html.

Please do not contact the<br />ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical<br />requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer or as specified<br />elsewhere in this document.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.3 1852.223-72 SAFETY AND HEALTH (SHORT FORM). (JUL 2015)<br />(a) Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational<br />illness; damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. NASA is<br />committed to protecting the safety and health of the public, our team members, and those<br />assets that the Nation entrusts to the Agency.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall have a documented, comprehensive and effective health and safety<br />program with a proactive process to identify, assess, and control hazards and take all<br />reasonable safety and occupational health measures consistent with standard industry practice<br />in performing this contract.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c) in subcontracts that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold where work will be conducted completely or partly on Federally-controlled facilities.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.4 1852.225-70 EXPORT LICENSES. (FEB 2000)<br />(a) The Contractor shall comply with all U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the<br />International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120 through 130, and the Export<br />Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730 through 799, in the performance of this contract. In the absence of available license exemptions/exceptions, the Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining the appropriate licenses or other approvals, if required, for exports of hardware, technical data, and software, or for the provision of technical assistance.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining export licenses, if required, before utilizing foreign persons in the performance of this contract, including instances where the work is to be performed on-site at NASA Langley Research Center, where the foreign person will have access to export-controlled technical data or software.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall be responsible for all regulatory record keeping requirements associated with the use of licenses and license exemptions/exceptions.</p>
<p>(d) The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that the provisions of this clause apply to its subcontractors.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.5 1852.237-73 RELEASE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION. (JUN 2005)<br />(a) As used in this clause, "sensitive information" refers to information, not currently in the public domain, that the Contractor has developed at private expense, that may embody trade secrets or commercial or financial information, and that may be sensitive or privileged.</p>
<p>(b) In accomplishing management activities and administrative functions, NASA relies heavily on the support of various service providers. To support NASA activities and functions, these service providers, as well as their subcontractors and their individual employees, may need access to sensitive information submitted by the Contractor under this contract. By submitting this proposal or performing this contract, the Contractor agrees that NASA may release to its service providers, their subcontractors, and their individual employees, sensitive information submitted during the course of this procurement, subject to the enumerated protections mandated by the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information.</p>
<p>(c)(1) The Contractor shall identify any sensitive information submitted in support of this proposal or in performing this contract. For purposes of identifying sensitive information, the<br />Contractor may, in addition to any other notice or legend otherwise required, use a notice similar to the following:</p>
<p>Mark the title page with the following legend:</p>
<p>This proposal or document includes sensitive information that NASA shall not disclose outside the Agency and its service providers that support management activities and administrative functions. To gain access to this sensitive information, a service provider's contract must contain the clause at NFS 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. Consistent with this clause,<br />the service provider shall not duplicate, use, or disclose the information in whole or in part for any purpose other than to perform the services specified in its contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use this information if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The information subject to this restriction is contained in pages (insert page numbers or other identification of pages).</p>
<p>Mark each page of sensitive information the Contractor wishes to restrict with the following<br />legend:</p>
<p>Use or disclosure of sensitive information contained on this page is subject to the restriction on<br />the title page of this proposal or document.</p>
<p>(2) The Contracting Officer shall evaluate the facts supporting any claim that particular<br />information is "sensitive." This evaluation shall consider the time and resources necessary to<br />protect the information in accordance with the detailed safeguards mandated by the clause at<br />1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. However, unless the Contracting Officer decides,<br />with the advice of Center counsel, that reasonable grounds exist to challenge the Contractor's<br />claim that particular information is sensitive, NASA and its service providers and their<br />employees shall comply with all of the safeguards contained in paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>
<p>(d) To receive access to sensitive information needed to assist NASA in accomplishing<br />management activities and administrative functions, the service provider must be operating<br />under a contract that contains the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. This<br />clause obligates the service provider to do the following:</p>
<p>(1) Comply with all specified procedures and obligations, including the Organizational Conflicts<br />of Interest Avoidance Plan, which the contract has incorporated as a compliance document.</p>
<p>(2) Utilize any sensitive information coming into its possession only for the purpose of<br />performing the services specified in its contract.</p>
<p>(3) Safeguard sensitive information coming into its possession from unauthorized use and<br />disclosure.</p>
<p>(4) Allow access to sensitive information only to those employees that need it to perform<br />services under its contract.</p>
<p>(5) Preclude access and disclosure of sensitive information to persons and entities outside of<br />the service provider's organization.</p>
<p>(6) Train employees who may require access to sensitive information about their obligations to<br />utilize it only to perform the services specified in its contract and to safeguard it from<br />unauthorized use and disclosure.</p>
<p>(7) Obtain a written affirmation from each employee that he/she has received and will comply<br />with training on the authorized uses and mandatory protections of sensitive information needed<br />in performing this contract.</p>
<p>(8) Administer a monitoring process to ensure that employees comply with all reasonable<br />security procedures, report any breaches to the Contracting Officer, and implement any<br />necessary corrective actions.</p>
<p>(e) When the service provider will have primary responsibility for operating an information<br />technology system for NASA that contains sensitive information, the service provider's contract<br />shall include the clause at 1852.204-76, Security Requirements for Unclassified Information<br />Technology Resources. The Security Requirements clause requires the service provider to<br />implement an Information Technology Security Plan to protect information processed, stored, or<br />transmitted from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or use. Service provider personnel<br />requiring privileged access or limited privileged access to these information technology systems<br />are subject to screening using the standard National Agency Check (NAC) forms appropriate to<br />the level of risk for adverse impact to NASA missions. The Contracting Officer may allow the<br />service provider to conduct its own screening, provided the service provider employs<br />substantially equivalent screening procedures.</p>
<p>(f) This clause does not affect NASA's responsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>(g) The Contractor shall insert this clause, including this paragraph (g), suitably modified to<br />reflect the relationship of the parties, in all subcontracts that may require the furnishing of<br />sensitive information.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evaluation Criteria</span>:</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>The quotation shall consist of: (1) Technical Acceptability, (2) Past Performance, and (3) Price Information. The award will be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror, with acceptable Past Performance.</p>
<p>Vendors will be required to submit a quote that will be evaluated in accordance with the specifications and provisions of the solicitation. Vendors are reminded to submit technical description as specified in FAR 52.212-1(b)(4).</p>
<p>Quotations will be evaluated as follows:<br />1. Technical Acceptability<br />2. Past Performance<br />3. Price</p>
<p>(1) TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY</p>
<p>Quotations submitted by each vendor will be evaluated in accordance with the specifications provided in the solicitation, FAR 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors, and Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 and determined to be either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to include pricing for all line items shall be cause for rejection of the quote for all line items.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical Evaluation Ratings</span>:</p>
<p>Rating: Acceptable<br />Description: Submission clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation</p>
<p>Rating: Unacceptable <br />Description: Submission does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation</p>
<p>If the technical submittal is determined "Unacceptable", it renders the entire quote technically unacceptable. Technical submissions that do not meet the minimum requirements will be rated as "Unacceptable" and will no longer be considered for further competition or award.</p>
<p>(2) PAST PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>Past performance is a measure of whether an offeror has satisfied customers in the past. Past Performance will be rated as "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable," focusing on performance that is recent and relevant to the contract requirements. For the purposes of this selection, recent past performance is defined as contracts performed within three years immediately prior to the date of solicitation issuance. Trends showing improving or deteriorating performance will also be considered.<br />The Past Performance evaluation results in an assessment of the offeror's probability of meeting the solicitation requirements. The Past Performance evaluation performed in support of this award process does not establish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offeror's past performance on past contracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers existing information regarding how well the offeror has performed on past contracts.</p>
<p>Past Performance information shall be obtained from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 9.104-6.</p>
<p>Past performance will be evaluated on an "Acceptable/Unacceptable" basis. Any rating of unsatisfactory on past performance elements Quality, Cost Control, Schedule, or Management will render an offeror's overall past performance rating as "Unacceptable," and the proposal will NOT be considered for award.<br /><br />Past Performance Evaluation Ratings:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rating</span>: Acceptable <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description</span>: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance is unknown.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rating</span>: Unacceptable<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description</span>: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NOTE: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or is so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of the acceptable/unacceptable rating, "unknown" past performance shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>(3) PRICE</p>
<p>The vendor shall submit one (1) signed copy of the completed SF1449, and if applicable, executed copy of Amendments. The prices quoted shall be in accordance with the solicitation, and will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR 13.106-3. Price quotes shall be held firm for sixty (60) days.</p>
<p>Vendors shall include pricing for all line items listed. Failure to do this shall be cause for rejection of the quote for all line items.</p>
<p>Vendors responding to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the government may request vendors to submit additional information/data to support price reasonableness such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar items, sales history for the same or similar items, price list with effective date and/or copies of catalog pages along with any applicable discounts. Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote.</p>
<p>Selection: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and issue an award using the procedures of FAR Part 13.5, Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items. The Government shall select the vendor whose quotation is the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable to the Government, considering all evaluation criteria. The Government reserves the right to not issue an award if it is not in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>System for Award Management (SAM): Vendors must be registered in the SAM database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.sam.gov/.</p>

GO: To be technically acceptable, all of the technical requirements as specified in this solicitation are met by the quoter. The technical capability factors are as follows:<br /><br /><strong>Factor / Standard</strong><br /><br />1. iHUB Server Subscription Provider:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The quoter must provide evidence that the firm is an authorized provider of Actuate iHUB Server Subscription products.<br /><br />2. Time &amp; Delivery:&nbsp; &nbsp;The quoter must provide a written statement with their quote indicating that they can provide the required subscription from 01 OCT 2016 through 30 SEP 2017 with three (3) one-year options.<br /><br />3. Experience on Similar Contracts:&nbsp; &nbsp;The quoter must provide evidence that it has successfully performed a minimum of two (2) contracts for the same or similar services within the past two (2) years to include contract type, contract number, contract value, point of contact name and telephone number, and the type of service provided.<br /><br /><strong>NO-GO:</strong> An unacceptable quote contains one or more deficiencies. The quote fails to meet specified technical requirements of this RFQ, and not all of the technical requirements are met by the quoter. If the quoter is other than the manufacturer, then documentation must be provided showing that the quoter is authorized to resell the Actuate product. Once the quotes have been determined to be technically acceptable, award will be based on lowest price. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which will be considered by the EEOC. Interested quoters are responsible for ensuring that their submitted quote has been received, and is legible.<br /><br /><strong>EVALUATION OF OPTIONS:</strong> The government will evaluate quotations for award purposes by adding the total price for the option years (CLIN 0004 through CLIN 0012) to the total price for the basic requirement (CLIN 0001 - 0003). Evaluation of the options will not obligate the government to exercise the options. <br /><br /><strong>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES:</strong> The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and/or clauses apply to this acquisition: FAR Provisions: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items; and, 52.204-7, System for Award Management.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting<br />`more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.</p>
<p>Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>

<p>(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and</p>
<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>
<p>(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or<br />(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).</p>
<p>(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.</p>
<p>(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special rule for related partnerships.

<p>(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.</p>

<p>(ii) options;</p>
<p>(iii) contracts to acquire stock;</p>

<p>(i) A sequential number.</p>
<p>(ii) The contract item which the "CFR" relates to.</p>
<p>(iii) A clear statement, definition, and description of the condition found, including but not limited to frame numbers, part numbers, materials and dimensions as appropriate.</p>

<p>(v) Indicate whether the report requires Cost Guard action, or if it is provided "for info" <br />only. If action is required, indicate the response time required by the Coast Guard and whether or not a contract extension would be needed if the additional work is authorized.</p>
<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>TITLE: Innovative Cross-domain Cyber Reactive Information Sharing (ICCyRIS)</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial Announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-14-02</p>
<p>CFDA NUMBER: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Cross Domain Innovation &amp; Science (CDIS) group of the Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate is interested in new innovative technologies and capabilities, within the Multi-Level Security (MLS) and Cyber Security environments, that promote the state of the art for secure, accreditable resilient and reactive capabilities to enhance the sharing of information between multiple security domains within both enterprise and mobile/tactical environments.</p>
<p>This BAA focuses on developing new technologies to allow secure data sharing; trusted computing; smart routing; cyber defense; Multi-Level Security (MLS) trust at the tactical edge; and a comprehensive, multi-security domain, user-defined operational picture to effectively and efficiently improve the state-of-the-art for defense enterprise, cloud, and mobile/tactical computing/operations.</p>
<p>The goals of this BAA are to improve cross-domain information sharing in five distinct technology areas:</p>
<p>1. Multi-Enclave/Multi-Domain Cyber User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) - Extending enterprise status monitoring efforts and Cross Domain Solutions (CDSs) adaptability to meet greater operator need.<br />2. High Risk Data Type Mitigation - Providing micro-virtualized ultra-high-risk content and investigations for malicious behavior before passing them to other security domains.<br />3. Fine-Grained Grammar for Orchestration - Use of formal grammars for quick adaptation of workflows to meet changing mission/security/performance requirements.<br />4. Content and Label Based Routing - Extending the trust provided at node and network environments to the information objects being passed to assure end-to-end trust in passing and delivering information to recipients.<br />5. MLS Trust at the Edge - Extending the robustness and usability of MLS mobile and desktop endpoint technology to meet the critical needs of our mobile warriors.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Focus Areas Applicable to all FYs:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Automatically Evaluate Video Streams for Cross-Domain Releasability</strong>: Perform an analysis of alternatives and incorporate the most mature systems into a prototype for evaluating the releasability of streaming data. This specifically includes but is not limited to speech-to-text, person recognition, and object recognition functionality plus system(s) to reason over the results of these functions.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Security through Virtualization</strong>: Utilize the broad swath of virtualization technologies to improve the state of the art of information assurance. Note also the related High Risk Binary Assessment Focus Area for FY 15 under this BAA, as well as the Secure Data Containers Focus Area for FY16.</p>
<p><strong>Novel, Trustworthy Filtration</strong>: Improve the state of data filtration through the use of techniques and procedures either previously unexplored in filtration or completely novel. Note that adding a new filter for an already covered file type is much less interesting than the ability to add classes of file types which are otherwise unaddressed by filtration engines. Note also the related High Risk Binary Assessment Focus Area for FY15 under this BAA, as well as the Imagery to Text Focus Area for FY18.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Orchestration Interfaces that don't require a "Man-in-the-Loop</strong>": Research and develop better automation of multiple data flows, each containing myriad functions and decision points, intended to affect large pools of data. This may be used in conjunction with various efforts such as the National Security Agency's (NSA's) Bray tool, Data Flow Configuration Format (DFCF), Guard Remote Management Protocol (GRMP), the CDS Management Information Base (MIB), and/or others. This capability includes the ability to demonstrate proposed changes against known pools of data, provide high level metrics regarding the original and changed results on those known pools of data, and to allow the user to drill down into greater, granular detail on the metrics as needed. These interfaces should not assume any particular degree of knowledge for users beyond a general computer use competency, and must ensure users' identity and authorization via appropriate methods.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Machine-to-Machine Automation</strong>: Many cross domain links are established between automated systems for various purposes. There are large swaths of commonality across most of these links. Build tools to leverage unmodified CDSs from the Unified Cross Domain Management Office (UCDMO) baseline to better meet the need for creating similar links in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Commodity Multi-Level Security (MLS) Networking</strong>: Create networking capable of mandatory access control (MAC) for content, locations and users marked, approved and operating at different levels of classification (plus releasability, caveats, and other security-relevant markings) utilizing commodity hardware, operating systems, software and infrastructure as much as practical. Complete redevelopment/replacement of existing networking infrastructure and endpoints is explicitly outside the scope of this effort.</p>
<p><strong>CAC Authentication via MicroSD Certificate Storage</strong>: Commercial mobile devices on their own, with standard configuration, are not secure enough for government use. However, to save money, many agencies are looking to leverage them. This poses a challenge for securing government/sensitive data access by the device user, while maintaining all the functionality of the commercial device itself. One approach is to utilize micro/nano Secure Digital (SD) cards to provide secure storage of access certificates. Phase one of this focus area will develop a secure, "read only" certificate store utilizing the Micro and Nano SD card form factors for use in physically unmodified Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Mobile Platforms. Software applications may be modified or created in order to demonstrate the functionality. The second phase of this focus area will test the proposed solution against real world scenarios utilizing life-like certificate data to ascertain robustness against published Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGS).</p>
<p><strong>Securing Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Mobile Device Common Access Card (CAC) Authentication via Near-Field Communication (NFC):</strong> Several COTS mobile devices feature NFC capabilities. Concurrently, there are requirements for warfighters to authenticate on computing resources with their Common Access Card (CAC). Unfortunately, physical external readers for CACs are unwieldy extensions to mobile devices. As such, there may be an opportunity to investigate utilizing the COTS NFC capabilities assuming they meet or exceed the security requirements accomplished by the physical readers. Given the repeated demonstrations given at most modern Black Hat events exploiting COTS NFC capabilities in many various ways, skepticism as to these devices' security capabilities will need to be assuaged and demonstrated as mitigated appropriately for operationally meaningful situations. Additionally, the demonstrated solution has additional challenges: It must be able to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data provided via CAC PKI capabilities, it must securely account for users with multiple credentials and access their existing certificates within appropriate networks (as in Global Access List, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)/ Active Directory (AD), etc.), must have a segregation capability if malicious code is detected, and allow for appropriate persistence of user authentication even after the device and NFC tag are outside of scanning range.</p>
<p><strong>Real Time Mobile Authentication:</strong> Many mobile users, especially field operators and tactical users, require mobile devices to be unlocked or readily available at any time throughout the mission. Long passphrases can be difficult to remember and may require attention that directs their vision away from the battlefield. Unfortunately, leaving the devices unlocked poses a large security risk if the phones are lost or stolen. By leveraging the sensors on the device (ex. Camera, GPS, Accelerometer (Gate), Humidity, Temperature) along with new wearable technology (Blood pressure, Heart Beat, Body Temp) advanced policies can be created to authenticate the user with the mobile device and keep mission critical applications unlocked and ready to use. These policies should be dynamic and adapt to the environment of the user. For example, complete operations such as locking the device or in certain locations wiping the device entirely. The measures of effectiveness will measure will be measured on authentication false positive/negative rates, impacts to battery life, CPU performance, I/O performance and tactical use-cases.</p>
<p><strong>High Risk Binary Assessment:</strong> Demonstrate a capability to automate invocation of potentially malicious content within a secure environment (such as a sandbox, virtual machine, or &lsquo;detonation chamber'). This capability should include scripting some appropriate number of user actions within commodity, unmodified applications and monitoring the environment for malicious or unexpected behaviors. The solution should incorporate both signature based detection of suspect behaviors as well as aberrant behavior based on a learned fingerprint of the normal functioning of the consuming application(s) within the environment. For example, if a given application doesn't normally generate alternate data streams within Windows, then generating an alternate data steam upon opening a new file in that application should be flagged. Integrity of the mechanisms that identify these unexpected behaviors must be protected from tampering or observation from within the secure environment. The solution shall also include one or more ways to adapt to new exercising applications and steps within the secure environment to either extend inspection of current file types supported and/or to offer support for new file types. In the final version delivered, no particular degree of knowledge beyond a general computer use competency should be expected from operators or those who adapt the system in the aforementioned manner(s).</p>
<p><strong>Situational Awareness of End-to-End Multi-level Information Flow</strong>: NSA's Cross Domain Solution Management Information Base (CDS-MIB) is a CDS-independent mechanism used to report including flow performance, errors, and other various metrics related to CDS health and status. This is only part of the picture that is necessary to efficiently be aware of the true multi-level information flow picture. The addition of information pertaining to CDS support devices such as external filtering appliances, CDS pre-processors, mission applications that leverage CDS and other IT integral to cross domain services (e.g., identity management, email infrastructure) is intended to enhance end-to-end situational awareness. This will increase situation awareness of all CDSs on the network, provide more insight into network status and services status, and provide opportunity for further integration with other activities, to include prior CDIS run efforts such as Audit-Based Sensing &amp; Protection (ASP) and Behavior Based Risk Assurance (BBRA). Once this capability is developed, other capabilities can use the information to include load balancers and automatic failover.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Mobile Device Management (DMDM):</strong> In order to provide secure containers for multiple compartments within mobile devices, a dynamic method to manage mobile devices using a secure Operating System (such as SE-Android) is required. This topic is to develop and demonstrate an innovative method for the management of such a device. This following management capabilities must be considered : support for multiple compartments on a single mobile platform, dividing each container into separate compartments, each with their own storage, keystore, and applications; the ability to provide flexible policies for the communication of all applications with each other and the device; provide high-level enforcement of applications to operate as specified by policy within a container; provide typical device management which includes: user management, device lock-down, container isolation protection, tamper resistance, and remote management (including the ability to wipe the device if compromised); provide continual assessment of the devices security state and make appropriate actions when that state is compromised. The prototype delivered must incorporate as many of these capabilities as possible and demonstrate successful container separation, device and policy management, and attestation of device security.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Level-Security Mobile Secure Foundation</strong>: Currently we are tracking two major technical approaches for Multi-Level Security (MLS) on Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware running the Android ecosystem. The first approach utilizes a hypervisor to separate multiple virtual machines' operations within the secure device. The second utilizes Security Enhanced (SE) Android policy to separate (sets of) processes. Both of these efforts have disparate strengths and weaknesses, as measured by performance, battery life, boot and access times, and other metrics. Other technical approaches to achieve assured Multi Level Security operation within the Android ecosystem may also be viable, if they can be brought to a similar or higher degree of maturity as well as accomplishing the rest of the tasking by the end of this effort. This effort is to provide a secure foundation for additional development in mobile devices for multiple DoD/IC use cases. As such, the solution chosen must follow accreditation guidelines throughout the effort and ideally have zero outstanding technical issues which would preclude accreditation. Additionally, the chosen solution must adhere to the relevant portions of the Mobility Capability Package protection profiles and National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) guidelines. The architecture shall include components selected from the National Security Agency Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) such as Data at Rest, Data in Transit, Mobile Device Management, etc. Finally, it is important that the solution be compatible with military needs for current and future tactical usage, including the continued usage of hardware peripherals. The successful solution will be based on commodity hardware, and ideally with commodity firmware utilizing hardware-based attestation (e.g. Trusted Platform Module (TPM), ARM TrustZone, Samsung KNOX, etc.) through the boot cycle and normal operation of the device. Solutions featuring custom operating systems and firmware are not ideal as they are expected to have higher procurement and maintenance costs and requirements, among other reasons. Measures of effectiveness will include the ability to integrate with existing technologies and abide by all of current and future NSA Mobility publications. The solution shall also adhere to strict requirements of battery life, CPU performance, I/O performance, boot-up times, and tactical application integration.</p>
<p><strong>CDS High Availability</strong>: Cross Domain Solutions (CDS) are typically less resilient than our other information technology (IT). Today we can support CDS load balancing and failover via typical mechanisms if the CDS protocols support it. There are, however, multiple technical shortfalls that limit the usability of these techniques, including the inability to: provide CDS load information to commodity load balancers, maintain configuration synchronization between multiple CDS and the ability to detect and recover from CDS failure. The purpose of this effort is to develop techniques to address these CDS availability concerns. Measures of effectiveness will include extensibility of approach to multiple CDS, ability to integrate with off-the-shelf tools for load balancing, information assurance acceptability and efficient utilization of network bandwidth for communication between components.</p>
<p><strong>Cross Domain Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Mediation Layer</strong>: A common approach to addressing cross domain information sharing requirements is cross-domain enablement of the underlying information technology (IT) that facilitates information sharing intra domain. Cross domain enablement of the machine-to-machine (M2M) protocols that support this IT is challenging because M2M protocols often have attributes that do not match typical CDS transfer characteristics. Some common examples include: non-atomic transactions (require more than one CDS transfer in order to complete), transactions that require ACK/NACK (CDS transfers are usually one way and may not provide failure notification) and transactions that are dependent upon one another (CDS are typically stateless and transfers are independent of one another). The purpose of this effort is to develop a mediation layer that can act as a foundation for M2M communications over a CDS. This mediation layer will be the integration point for specific protocol termination services (e.g. - DB transactions, Web Services) and would handle the necessary information management and CDS data flow understanding to map between M2M interface requirements and CDS transfer capabilities. Measures of effectiveness will include ease of integration with a new set of M2M data flows, native M2M protocol independence, ability to protect end system data integrity from CDS filtering issues, solution performance (throughput and latency) and ease of recovery when issues arise (e.g. - CDS is unavailable, CDS filters misconfigured and start failing transactions).</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Mobile Device Management (DMDM):</strong> In order to provide secure containers for multiple compartments within mobile devices, a dynamic method to manage mobile devices using a secure Operating System (such as SE-Android) is required. This topic is to develop and demonstrate an innovative method for the management of such a device. This following management capabilities must be considered: support for multiple compartments on a single mobile platform, dividing each container into separate compartments, each with their own storage, key store, and applications; the ability to provide flexible policies for the communication of all applications with each other and the device; provide high-level enforcement of applications to operate as specified by policy within a container; provide typical device management which includes: user management, device lock-down, container isolation protection, tamper resistance, and remote management (including the ability to wipe the device if compromised); provide continual assessment of the devices security state and make appropriate actions when that state is compromised. The prototype delivered must incorporate as many of these capabilities as possible and demonstrate successful container separation, device and policy management, and attestation of device security. The solution must adhere to the relevant portions of the Mobility Capability Package protection profiles and National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) guidelines. The measures of effectiveness will be measured on application performance, agility to tactical low-no communication situations and the ability to integrate with components from the National Security Agency Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) such as Data at Rest, Data in Transit, Mobile Device Management, etc.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Applied Open Systems Development Techniques for C4I Trusted MLS Platforms:</span></strong> <br /><br />Further the state of the art of new and existing innovative technologies and explore other potential COTS / GOTS capabilities that address the challenges of improved security, resiliency and agility through integration of novel Open Systems technologies into modernized systems of record. Research and develop new Open Architecture technologies through studies, analysis, engineering, design, development, prototype testing, demonstration and integration of new and existing technologies. Improve secure information sharing within and among multiple security domains from the enterprise to the tactical/mobile user which includes overall cyber security capabilities for evolving multi-level solutions for the monitoring and management of their overall security environment and ecosystem. Leverage system requirements, combined with current socio-political considerations in relevant areas of responsibility to create realistic use cases and demonstration scripts for use in exercising solutions and capabilities. Topic ensures a cohesive approach to addressing the MLS solutions lifecycle; from idea to proof of concept/realistic prototype to integration and testing of new technology within live and simulated environments.</p>
<p><strong>On-Demand Cross Domain Solution (CDS) Filtering:</strong> Provide a trustworthy mechanism to securely store, deliver, and deploy new filters into CDSs on demand. The intent is to develop a new or extend an existing agnostic Application Programmer's Interface (API) to allow multiple disparate transfer CDSs to interrogate one or more trusted store(s) for filters to be secure delivered in near-real-time, and to provide a reference implementation for that trusted store. This is intended to allow CDSs to adapt to changing workload requirements and threat environments. If the CDS already contains a similar capability or partial capability, it is expected that this API will wrapper them rather than redeveloping.</p>
<p><strong>Enhance Logic and Visualization for Enterprise Capabilities:</strong> Extend the ability to monitor one or more transfer Cross Domain Solutions (CDSs) beyond prior efforts' scope by incorporating business logic through a reasoning engine to examine the data collected and stored via CDS-MIB, SNMP &amp; perhaps alternate sources as well as performing trend analysis across this information. This would be expected to be able to automatically suggest and/or enforce reporting and warning thresholds to alert responsible parties via Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) (for integration with enterprise management &amp; alert systems), email and/or text to abnormal activity with respect to the CDSs' normal functioning. Given other previously developed tools, this developed capability might be expected to automatically react to incoming data and alter one or more CDSs' operational posture, either to ensure operational goals and/or reduce data exfiltration/malware infiltration.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile MLS Cross Domain XML Routing:</strong> Evaluate existing XML data tagging standards for use in both IP-based wired networks and wireless mobile networking environments, both for traditional tagging roles and also in support of cross security domain routing decisions. Publish this evaluation in order to gather feedback and consensus and hopefully drive standardization across DoD/IC and eventually the mobile industry. Finally, develop a prototype that enables standardized cross domain routing originating and/or ending on a mobile platform.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced File Typing</strong>: Perform best of breed Analysis of Alternatives between deep content inspection and/or file parsing capabilities such as Apache Tika, Data Format Description Language (DFDL), and similar. Using the best of breed, create a prototype to perform deep content inspection of files to detect and/or extract metadata, binary blobs and/or structured text content to properly &amp; fully identify file types (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) types). Develop with common programmatic API calls plus appropriate web service interfaces and NSA's Filter Componentization Effort (FCE) specification. Test and evaluate performance and reliability of file type identification. Include edge cases such as polymorphism, spoofing, multiple file type compatibilities, and container file types.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus Areas for FY 18:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Multi-Level Security Collaboration Tool Suite</strong>: Modern collaboration tools, including web-based conferencing, instant messaging, whiteboarding, and application sharing, allow remote participants to communicate and collaborate with each other within a single domain. However, many of these tools cannot be used for cross domain communication due to the lack of build-in security and not interoperable with existing Cross Domain Solutions (CDS). Additionally, replacing existing collaboration tools with more advance and secure alternatives is not an ideal solution because users will need to spend time to familiarize themselves with the new tools. The effort will research approaches to bring security and/or functionalities into existing, widely-used collaboration tools, such as Skype for Business and BigBlueButton, and make them interoperable with an existing CDS to enable cross domain communication. The approaches may include additional components (ex. proxy) to bridge any capability gaps, among others. The goal of this effort is to enable single-domain collaboration tools to do cross domain communications, with minimal changes to either the tools or the CDS. Metrics to be tracked include throughput, latency, jitter, and potentially others.</p>
<p><strong>FPGA - Security and Performance Enhanced Processing</strong>: FPGA coupled CPU's such as Intel's forthcoming chipset open up new possibilities for increasing specific algorithmic performance and security. This topic seeks efforts that look to expand the security capabilities of OpenXT through use of such FPGA enabled chips. Specifically, to enhance security by transferring core OS components to the fabric as a proof of concept and demonstrate the benefit to security through doing so. Techniques which improve system performance through transference to the FPGA are also sought after. Such as, efforts to enable cross domain processing that could benefit from custom FPGA fabric implementations of various algorithms. Efforts to port existing multi-level security scanning techniques to the FPGA co-processor are welcome under this topic. Finally, novel research efforts using the FPGA for next generation techniques are welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Mobile Cross domain access</strong>: In recent years considerable strides have taken place on mobile virtualization technologies. Build on existing mobile virtualization solutions for ARM mobile devices capable of storing and transmitting classified information on Commercial solutions for Classified (CSfC) devices. Solution must be quickly adaptable to future commercial devices and implement security features developed by NIAP mobility protection profiles. Provide expanded functionality and virtualization of hardware features not located in the ARM application processor such as protecting the baseband cellular chip and integrated circuits involved in providing one or more hardware root(s) of trust. The end goal of this research area is to provide a mobile phone that can be approved for simultaneous access to both classified and unclassified networks on commercial systems that can be fielded before the mobile platform is considered end of life, which is typically two years on most flagship mobile platforms. Metrics to be tracked include alterations to hardware, battery life, user response latency, and CSfC exceptions, among other potential metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Secure Sharing of Content in Mobile Tactical Networks</strong>: DoD is becoming more reliant on COTS mobile devices to provide mission critical documents to users in the field. Once outside of a trusted network, user devices are heavily locked down to prevent information exfiltration. Consequently, this prevents users from easily transferring mission data into and out of the device. Often times, users attempt to circumvent IA procedures or use out-of-band channels for transferring data leaving a wide, unmonitored attack vector. This effort will investigate innovative mechanisms to protect the data itself, so that regardless of transport mechanisms or applications used the data will always be protected. The solution will need to work in tactical environments where access to a server nonexistent. Proposed solutions may leverage existing Digital Rights Management (DRM) technologies or DoD PKI infrastructures, but these are not required. It is desirable for proposed solution to work on both iOS and Android devices. If proposed solution requires changes to existing applications, a library or well-defined API will need to be provided. Proposed solution should not interrupt the mobile devices' root of trust. The solution's performance will be measured by battery time to live, performance overhead, additional time for users to access the device, interoperability between current and future devices, and the ability to conform to DoD Mobility Information Assurance standards.</p>

<p>V.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION</span>:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the degree of innovation for the approach and the use of innovative modern architectures in development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology; the use of analysis, metrics &amp; testing and adherence to Information Assurance and Cross-Domain best practices, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge and experience within cross-domain environments, (3) Openness, Maturity &amp; Assurance of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of degree of Information Assurance and Cross-Domain standards implemented, and (4) Reasonableness and Realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA from multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>4. FEDERAL AWARDEE PERFORMANCE AND INTEGRITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (FAPIIS) PUBLIC ACCESS: As required by 2 CFR 200 of the Uniform Guidance and FAR 9.104-6, the Government is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the FAPIIS before making any award in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000) over the period of performance. An applicant may review and comment on any information about itself that a federal awarding agency previously entered. The Government will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR &sect; 200.205 Federal Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants.</p>

<p>BAA NUMBER: BAA-AFRL-RIK-2015-0012</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) Number: 12.800</p>
<p><strong>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) seeks to provide research and development for forming a revolutionary approach to information fusion and analysis by leveraging service-oriented architecture, open standards, and cutting-edge fusion and analytical algorithms to provide real-time (or near real-time) intelligence for decision makers. This BAA shall research and develop novel techniques to assist users with discovering the golden nuggets in the data - potential approaches include fusing diverse data sources, filtering noise, and leveraging pattern learning to derive patterns of life. Further, technical capabilities developed under this BAA will minimize user time spent gathering data and reporting data, while preserving and providing more time for analysis. This will be accomplished through several means to include a data framework that can easily and quickly connect to sundry data sources, a rich, intuitive personalized workspace and experience, a variety of user-defined visualization displays, machine learning to assist and automate mundane tasks, and a custom report generation tool.</p>
<p>This BAA will research and develop: (1) Analytic services that provide a greater understanding of diverse data sources to assist decision makers and deliver a decision advantage. This includes multi-INT and all source fusion, correlating data within and across diverse, heterogeneous data sources to determine patterns of life and indications and warnings, and project future activity in the near term;<br />(2) An enterprise platform that will host analytics, customizable workspaces and visualizations, a data framework for connecting to diverse and potentially heterogeneous data sources, security and authorization components, and provide a software development kit (SDK) and application programming interface (API). The intent is to develop a platform that other third parties (e.g. vendors) can leverage and implement new software components providing a much broader and deeper enterprise experience that is agile and flexible; and (3) Develop evaluation metrics and scenarios, and perform testing to ensure satisfaction of key performance parameters.</p>
<p><strong>Mission Requirements: </strong></p>
<p>The research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) performed under the auspices of this BAA shall address a breadth of mission domains to include Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR) for air, space and cyber. Specific applications of this research and development include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>1) Custom software infrastructure that is deployable, maintainable, and elastic; The software framework shall provide ingestion (discover, access, model), persistence, analytics, visualization, publication/reporting and system management components</p>
<p>2) Mission data file development to inform understanding of mission environment and provide mission decision-making parameters to inform machine observe, orient, decide, and act (OODA) loop</p>
<p>3) Global, user-defined common operating picture for air, space and cyber operations that can support multiple areas of responsibility (AORs) and Multi-INT feeds; custom visualizations and applications for geospatial and temporal analysis</p>
<p>4) Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) exploitation and analysis of social media, news feeds, and other publicly available information</p>
<p>5) Entity extraction and resolution within and across data sources</p>
<p>6) Disseminate fused air tracks and provide alerts for detected anomalies</p>
<p>7) Mission planning of network-enabled weapons and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms</p>
<p>8) Machine-to-machine integration of mission planning and collection management systems across the Air Operations Centers (AOCs) and Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF-DCGS) sites</p>
<p>9) Conduct gain/loss analysis for collection management</p>
<p>10) Command and control of cyber forces and mission planning</p>
<p>11) Operational level command and control capabilities (bridging strategic to tactical-unit level) to plan, coordinate, and execute non-kinetic capabilities with kinetic means to deliver synchronized global effects</p>
<p>12) Provide systems engineering, integration, training and testing</p>
<p>13) Interface with existing programs of record to obtain access to data sources (e.g. Air Operations Center Weapons System (AOC WS), Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF-DCGS), Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J), Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB), Command Post of the Future (CPOF)</p>
<p>There are two Focus Areas:</p>
<p>1) Analytics for Situation Awareness<br />2) Data Framework and Core Services</p>
<p>Proposers may address all or parts of any of the two focus areas and must clearly indicate the technical area(s) being addressed in the white paper (see content and format section below). Teaming is highly encouraged. All performers under this BAA will be expected to work cooperatively with one another to develop, integrate, implement, test, and evaluate technical capabilities. Therefore, proposers should carefully review the expectations for all focus areas in order to fully understand the context of their own focus area.</p>
<p><strong>Focus Area Descriptions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus Area 1- Analytics for Situation Awareness</strong></p>
<p>Situation Awareness is defined as the perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the near future. This BAA is immediately focused on researching and developing novel analytic techniques to accomplish situation awareness in the battlespace for perception, comprehension and projection. In order to achieve this goal, these analytics must be mission-focused and have a strong impetus towards creating a decision advantage.</p>
<p><strong>1.1 Analytic Services</strong>: Analytic techniques can be wide ranging. This BAA is concentrated on a broad spectrum of analysis procedures to include, but is not limited to pattern analysis, spatial-temporal analysis, change detection, link analysis, social network analysis, and big data analytics. These analytic techniques must be developed as services made available in a plug and play, modular design.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Machine Learning</strong>: This BAA shall also provide cutting-edge machine learning capabilities to assist and automate user tasks. Potential applications include providing recommendations based on what data the user is interested in and has viewed, assisting with task management and the delegation of tasks, deriving alerts from patterns of life and indications and warnings, and learning and automating common user actions such as routine queries.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus Area 2 - Data Framework and Core Services</span></strong></p>
<p>The data framework and core services are intended to provide the fundamental and essential components to develop an enterprise software system. This will serve as an overarching integration framework that will be responsible for interfacing with analytic services while providing required capabilities such as data access, security, and visualization services.</p>
<p><strong>2.1 Infrastructure</strong>: Software infrastructure developed under this BAA shall provide a lightweight, open source Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) framework that is capable of facilitating the interaction and communication between services and other software applications in a service-oriented architecture. The ESB shall provide capabilities to integrate databases, services, and legacy systems and facilitate communication across disparate transport and messaging technologies. The infrastructure shall support a myriad of database systems to include, but not limited to document-oriented databases and NoSQL data stores. Lastly, the infrastructure shall be designed to serve as a platform as a service, as well as be interoperable with other third party services.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Data Framework Services</strong>: Proposers shall provide a data framework that is able to discover, model, connect, search and enter data across a variety of types and sources. For external data sources, this data framework shall extract, transform and load diverse data sources while performing data alignment and association to reduce and resolve duplicative entities that exist in multiple data sources. The system shall be able to search to find data across data types and sources. This search can be based on specific user-defined keywords, semantic search, and also faceted search. This search function shall leverage natural language processing techniques to ensure high precision and recall. The proposed system shall allow search results to be manipulated in a pivot table-like fashion which could update any graphic based on that data.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Security Services</strong>: The proposed system shall include a robust and flexible security framework. At a minimum, this shall contain: (1) policy-based access control and role-based access control (RBAC) that allows users access while also restricting system access only to authorized users. RBAC will control the roles assigned, allow authorized users to take on specific roles (e.g. administrator), and exercise permission. (2) The system shall also utilize single sign-on (SSO) authentication and public key infrastructure (PKI) for authenticating users that access the system. (3) Lastly, the system shall provide audit logs and the ability for system administrators to provide key system level metrics. Secure application development practices shall be followed to minimize rework required to comply with DoD Information Assurance (IA) policies. Software provided shall successfully pass various security vulnerability scans such as Fortify, Nessus, and Burp in order to achieve authority to operate on operational networks. Also, the security services shall appropriately mark data per classification standards (e.g. Controlled Access Program Coordination Office (CAPCO) markings).</p>
<p><strong>2.4 User Experience Services</strong>: This system shall provide end users with a fully customizable enterprise experience. For instance, customizable dashboards shall be available once users sign-in to the system. Dashboards can also be developed for use by a specific community. The dashboard will serve as the main interface for the system and must be fully customizable to allow operators to search and select the data they need to see once the system is accessed and provide user-specified information (specific to the user's AOR) on their requested display (e.g. map, graph). The user interface shall also allow users to share data, files, and notes and provide a collaborative social workspace. This workspace will permit users to save and share queries and working files, create target folders on entities of interest, and provide a user workflow for publishing reports and documents. The workflow will allow users to create, review, update and delete reports and rely on role-based access control for permissions. The user will also be able to export reports and records as appropriate. Lastly, the user experience and interface shall be reusable and domain agnostic.</p>
<p><strong>2.5 Visualization Services:</strong> Users shall be able to access and visualize data through a myriad of methods. This BAA shall research how users interact with the user interface and develop novel visualization displays. Proposed approaches shall allow users to query the centralized database and output results to a diverse set of visualization displays. As data is selected, the visualization displays shall provide the full details on the data by displaying the data record. Typical displays include, but are not limited to table, report view, grid, graph, map (2D/3D, heatmap), timeline, and link analysis.</p>
<p><strong>2.6 Report Generator Services:</strong> Many times, users are required to develop a briefing or report to share and publish. The proposed approach shall provide a capability to automate this process, saving critical time that can be better spent analyzing data. This report generation capability shall allow users the ability to output their required data to different report types to include, but not limited to Microsoft PowerPoint, Excel, Word, and Adobe PDF.</p>
<p><strong>2.7 Mobile, Disconnected, and Disadvantaged Operations</strong>: The data framework and infrastructure designed and developed shall allow users to operate the software system from a mobile device. For users with little or no connectivity, the proposed approach shall allow users to still perform in an appropriate manner. Disconnected Operations shall allow users to have access to key capabilities of the system such as search and data entry with no connectivity. For disadvantaged users with little bandwidth, the system shall be able to execute in a lightweight manner so that users can still conduct critical functions.</p>

<p><strong>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in equal importance and will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>a. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The soundness of approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology, <br />b. Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, <br />c. Openness, Maturity and Assurance of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and <br />d. Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:</p>
<p>Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>4. FEDERAL AWARDEE PERFORMANCE AND INTEGRITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (FAPIIS) PUBLIC ACCESS: As required by 2 CFR 200 of the Uniform Guidance and FAR 9.104-6, the Government is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the FAPIIS before making any award in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000) over the period of performance. An applicant may review and comment on any information about itself that a federal awarding agency previously entered. The Government will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR &sect; 200.205 Federal Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants.</p>
<p><strong>VI. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">STEP TWO</span> INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</strong></p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>

<DESC><p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></strong>AFRL Edwards will be conducting an Industry Day for an upcoming Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) on Wednesday, 16 November 2016, from 0730 - 1600 hours.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Program Description</span></strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Air Force Research Laboratory at Edwards AFB </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">is interested in developing flight ready 1N, 22N, and 100N AF-M315E monopropellant thrusters. The goal of this effort is to advance current AF-M315E technology by developing and demonstrating thruster hardware capable of providing similar lifetimes and duty-cycles when compared to the current standard in spacecraft monopropellants, hydrazine. The high combustion temperatures of AF-M315E have posed several engineering roadblocks in hardware development. Although AF-M315E provides a 50% increase in density impulse when compared to hydrazine, current state-of-the-Art (SOTA) 1N, flight weight AF-M315E thrusters negate the positive impacts of the propellant by having a total firing lifetime of approximately 1/4<sup>th</sup> the total firing lifetime of current hydrazine technology. SOTA 22N AF-M315E thrusters are closer than 1N thrusters to the hydrazine lifetime benchmark, but there is still area for improvement. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Along with decreased total lifetime, the thermal issues presented by the elevated combustion temperatures have the potential to diminish the range of operational duty-cycles. For AF-M315E to become an operationally relevant spacecraft monopropellant, the issues with overall lifetime and duty-cycle limitations must be addressed and remedied. The outcome of this effort will provide the United States Air Force and other potential users with the information and hardware necessary to confidently move forward into the future of high performing, green monopropellants serving as hydrazine alternatives. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The 1N and 22N thrusters will be capable of providing small impulse bits required for such things as attitude correction, orbital rendezvous, and formation flying, while the 100N system will be used for generation of large orbital changes such as orbit raising or lowering and circularization. Propulsion systems of most interest to the Air Force are those that retain maximum mission flexibility with the maximum impulse and capability for large-scale orbital maneuvers.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Development work will focus on advancing the critical technologies required to improve overall thruster lifetime and reduce duty-cycle limitations, with the end product being an AF-M315E thruster with similar lifetime and duty-cycle performance when compared to current hydrazine systems. While the definition of duty-cycle performance is relatively well understood, the definition for a thruster's effective lifetime varies throughout the industry. This variance has led AFRL/RQRS to establish a definition of thruster lifetime based on the total impulse delivered at nominal operating conditions, where nominal operating conditions are considered to be 0.25 second duration pulses. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Along with similar lifetimes and operational duty-cycles, the new AF-M315E systems should have similar size, weight, power, and heat up times as the current SOTA hydrazine thrusters. This enables a smooth transition of technology to both the satellite manufacturer and user communities, providing them with improved capabilities without the hassle of significant reengineering of designs or Con-Ops. Table 1 lists the desired AF-M315E thruster specifications derived from data provided by current manufacturers of hydrazine systems. Though not listed in Table 1, it is also desired that the specific impulse for a minimum impulse bit be no less than 30% of the specific impulse for steady-state operation.</span></p>

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE AMENDMENT 11/2/16: The purpose of this amendment is to notify interested offerors that the solicitation number has changed to W911QX-17-R-0007. This is an administrative amendment only; no action is required at this time. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />BACKGROUND</strong></span>
<p>The explosion of social media and interactive internet services has revolutionized the Information Environment (IE), and fundamentally created a sensor system comprised of billions of citizens observing and reporting activities across the globe. Additionally, global actors, both state and non-state, are using the same interactive internet system to plan and coordinate activities across the spectrum of operations. Essentially, the internet has become an ubiquitous Command and Control (C2) and sensor system that impacts the United States (US) and its allies' missions around the globe, including Shaping activities, force protection, counter-terrorism, counter-Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), and a myriad of others.</p>
<p>In response, the Government has established the Secure Unclassified Network (SUNet): an off-Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN), For Official Use Only (FOUO)-accredited unclassified platform to enable the Department of Defense (DoD), US Government Interagency, and Coalition Partners to securely collaborate and share Publicly Available Information, FOUO data, analytics, and other enterprise services. This platform enables mission partners to establish virtual enclaves, control access to those enclaves, and to acquire, develop, and deploy mission-specific data sets and analytics that can be shared across multiple enclaves or restricted based on mission requirements.</p>
<p>The Government intends to establish an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle(s) under which Task Orders (TO) may be issued to provide the requisite services for the establishment and maintenance of SUNet enclaves. The Government anticipates the duration of the IDIQ contract to be five (5) years. The objective of this effort is to develop SUNet Enclaves for mission specific requirements that include development of applications or analytics, as well as the integration of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and government off-the-shelf (GOTS) products with new data and collaboration features across US Government and foreign partner communities of interest.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to use FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</strong></span></p>
<p>The intent of this Pre-Solicitation Synopsis is to verify the security clearance information of interested offerors and to develop an "Interested Parties List" to be used in the development of this acquisition.</p>
<p>Security Clearance Eligibility - This notification provides an opportunity for all potential offers to submit their current clearance information for verification. Those offerors who can confirm their eligibility of meeting the security requirements for this effort will be allowed to participate in the draft and/or formal solicitation process. The closing date for clearance information to be submitted to participate in this clearance verification process is 26 August 2015, at 5:00 PM EST.</p>
<p>Offerors must have a valid U.S. facility clearance of Top Secret, Secret storage capability, and have technical personnel with Top Secret/ Special Compartmented Information (SCI) Clearance in order to have access to details under this draft and/or formal solicitation process. In order for this information to be verified, the offeror must provide the following:</p>
<p>(1) company name and address, <br />(2) contact information for their Facility Security Officer,<br />(3) CAGE code for their Top Secret Facility Clearance, and<br />(4) the name, social security number and email address of one (1) of their Top Secret/Special Compartmented Information (SCI) cleared technical personnel.</p>
<p><br />Responses to this notice are due on or before&nbsp;26 August 2015, at 5:00 PM EST. Offerors must provide the required information to Allison Murray, Contract Specialist, at allison.s.murray.civ@mail.mil. The offeror is encouraged to provide this information in an encrypted zip file using a 256-bit AES encryption (ex. Winzip) and submit via encrypted email. No phone calls will be accepted.</p>

<p>The solicitation will be issued on or about August 11, 2015.</p>
<p>Modification 1: This synopsis was modified to reflect the partial small business set-aside. <br /><br />This is a 50% small business set-aside, please read the solicitation carefully.&nbsp; Only the non-set-aside portion is initially solicited and competed. The solicitation clauses and other information reflect only this reduced quantity. An award will first be made on the non-set-aside portion. The set-aside portion will then be negotiated with the lowest responsive small business concern who submitted an offer on this solicitation. The small business must agree to the price on the non-set-aside portion. If not, the set-aside portion is negotiated with the next low small business. This process continues until the entire set-aside quantity is awarded. The set-aside fails if no small business can meet the price on the non-set-aside portion. See FAR 19.502-3(c) for information regarding partial set-aside procedures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S. Government is pursuing a long-term, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with firm fixed pricing for the duration of a firm fixed price base period of three (3) years and zero (0) option years. The solicitation is for DLA managed consumables, for the procurement of certain part numbered items that cross-reference to National Stock Numbers (NSNs) identified in Section B of the solicitation. The items will be solicited using FAR Part 15 guidelines. There are two manufacturing sources, AM General, LLC (CAGE 34623) and Standard Bent Glass Corp. (CAGE 458W5); therefore, the acquisition will be limited to items manufactured by these manufacturers. Because there is only two manufacturing sources, the requirement is being procured with other than full and open competition in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, or in this case, a limited number of responsible sources, and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The statutory authority permitting this is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1). Offerors are not required to submit an offer on all items within the solicitation as each item will be procured on an "all or none" basis per NSN, and for the purpose of this solicitation, an NSN will be considered a Contract Line Item Number (CLIN).</p>
<p>The items to be procured are listed below.</p>

<p>The solicitation will be issued on or about August 12, 2015.</p>
<p>Modification 1: This synopsis was modified to reflect the partial small business set-aside.<br /><br />Modification 2: This synopsis is modified to reflect the actual release date of the solicitation from August 11, 2015 to August 12, 2015. The solicitation will close on September 11, 2015 at 5:00 PM Eastern Time. Additionally, this modification includes the solicitation and its attachments.<br /><br />Modification 3: This synopsis is modified to reflect amendment 0001 of the synopsis which adds packaging data and extends the closing date from September 11, 2015 to September 18, 2015. No additional changes were made.<br /><br />This is a 50% small business set-aside, please read the solicitation carefully.&nbsp; Only the non-set-aside portion is initially solicited and competed. The solicitation clauses and other information reflect only this reduced quantity. An award will first be made on the non-set-aside portion. The set-aside portion will then be negotiated with the lowest responsive small business concern who submitted an offer on this solicitation. The small business must agree to the price on the non-set-aside portion. If not, the set-aside portion is negotiated with the next low small business. This process continues until the entire set-aside quantity is awarded. The set-aside fails if no small business can meet the price on the non-set-aside portion. See FAR 19.502-3(c) for information regarding partial set-aside procedures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S. Government is pursuing a long-term, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with firm fixed pricing for the duration of a firm fixed price base period of three (3) years and zero (0) option years. The solicitation is for DLA managed consumables, for the procurement of certain part numbered items that cross-reference to National Stock Numbers (NSNs) identified in Section B of the solicitation. The items will be solicited using FAR Part 15 guidelines. There are two manufacturing sources, AM General, LLC (CAGE 34623) and Standard Bent Glass Corp. (CAGE 458W5); therefore, the acquisition will be limited to items manufactured by these manufacturers. Because there is only two manufacturing sources, the requirement is being procured with other than full and open competition in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, or in this case, a limited number of responsible sources, and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The statutory authority permitting this is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1). Offerors are not required to submit an offer on all items within the solicitation as each item will be procured on an "all or none" basis per NSN, and for the purpose of this solicitation, an NSN will be considered a Contract Line Item Number (CLIN).</p>
<p>The items to be procured are listed below.</p>

<p>The solicitation will be issued on or about August 12, 2015.</p>
<p>Modification 1: This synopsis was modified to reflect the partial small business set-aside.<br /><br />Modification 2: This synopsis is modified to reflect the actual release date of the solicitation from August 11, 2015 to August 12, 2015. The solicitation will close on September 11, 2015 at 5:00 PM Eastern Time. Additionally, this modification includes the solicitation and its attachments.<br /><br />Modification 3: This synopsis is modified to reflect amendment 0001 of the solicitation which adds packaging data and extends the closing date from September 11, 2015 to September 18, 2015. No additional changes were made.<br /><br />Modification 4: This synopsis is modified to reflect amendment 0002 of the solicitation which extends the closing date from September 18, 2015 to September 25, 2015. No additional changes were made.<br /><br />This is a 50% small business set-aside, please read the solicitation carefully.&nbsp; Only the non-set-aside portion is initially solicited and competed. The solicitation clauses and other information reflect only this reduced quantity. An award will first be made on the non-set-aside portion. The set-aside portion will then be negotiated with the lowest responsive small business concern who submitted an offer on this solicitation. The small business must agree to the price on the non-set-aside portion. If not, the set-aside portion is negotiated with the next low small business. This process continues until the entire set-aside quantity is awarded. The set-aside fails if no small business can meet the price on the non-set-aside portion. See FAR 19.502-3(c) for information regarding partial set-aside procedures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S. Government is pursuing a long-term, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with firm fixed pricing for the duration of a firm fixed price base period of three (3) years and zero (0) option years. The solicitation is for DLA managed consumables, for the procurement of certain part numbered items that cross-reference to National Stock Numbers (NSNs) identified in Section B of the solicitation. The items will be solicited using FAR Part 15 guidelines. There are two manufacturing sources, AM General, LLC (CAGE 34623) and Standard Bent Glass Corp. (CAGE 458W5); therefore, the acquisition will be limited to items manufactured by these manufacturers. Because there is only two manufacturing sources, the requirement is being procured with other than full and open competition in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, or in this case, a limited number of responsible sources, and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The statutory authority permitting this is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1). Offerors are not required to submit an offer on all items within the solicitation as each item will be procured on an "all or none" basis per NSN, and for the purpose of this solicitation, an NSN will be considered a Contract Line Item Number (CLIN).</p>
<p>The items to be procured are listed below.</p>

<p>GSA Retail Operations is looking to offer a complete category management to its RIA-JMTC and SKOT Group customers requiring a specific array of products.&nbsp; GSA is requesting potential sources to provide products that fall within numerous categories that will be made available for requisition from GSA from its RIA-JMTC and SKOT Group customers to support their missions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RIA-JMTC receives requirements from all of the services to provide design, prototyping, manufacturing, testing and simulation services.&nbsp; RIA-JMTC utilizes the Department of Defense's (DoD's) only fully integrated manufacturing facility and the only remaining DoD foundry. Their spectrum of service capabilities include engineering, casting, laser cutting, machining, welding, painting, assembly, non-destructive testing and simulation, and the foundry.</p>
<p>SKOT Group manages over 50 of the Army's Combat Engineer and Ordnance Sets, Kits, Outfits and Tools (SKOT), providing industrial quality tools with life time warranties, foam cut outs for rapid inventory, and increased ease of accountability and transportability to the warfighter. SKOT Group's broad portfolio includes SKOTs for tracked and wheeled vehicle emergency repair and maintenance, armament systems repair, hydraulic systems repair, metal working and machining, cutting and welding, engineering and construction, urban operations, Army diving mission, inflatable boats and motors, and fire suppression and protection equipment.</p>
<p>Interested sources are challenged to provide the most cost-effective approach that meets the following overall objectives:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Providing vendor-consigned inventory (stock) to GSA for resale/distribution to its RIA-JMTC and SKOT GROUP customers. Each vendor, for their product category or categories, will be required to consign stock to GSA; ownership of the vendor-consigned inventory (VCI) will be passed to GSA when the stock is requisitioned by its RIA-JMTC and SKOT GROUP customers through GSA's Point of Sale (POS) system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Maintain min/max VCI levels, source new products in its assigned category or categories, and provide Just-in-Time (JIT) delivery for products not stocked on-site.&nbsp; As the VCI drops to the minimum level, GSA will place an order via GSA's POS to the vendor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;GSA along with its government customers will provide individual storage areas for stocking of required products by each vendor.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;All vendors will communicate with GSA through Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).&nbsp; As the stock levels in the automated Point of Use (POU), non-automated storage areas or cribs, and POU equipment containing trays or bins for distribution of materials drop to the minimum level, GSA will place an order via GSA's POS to the vendor for their product category.&nbsp; GSA, along with its government customers, will provide individual storage areas for stocking of required products by each vendor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Vendors can win one or multiple product categories; each category of product will be delivered to the 4PL location on Rock Island Arsenal for delivery to RIA-JMTC and SKOT GROUP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>GSA intends to establish a limited number of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for products to fill requisition orders.&nbsp; GSA intends to issue multiple BPAs that are represented within the following product categories:</p>

The Seller confirms to have sourced all products submitted in this Bid from manufacturer-approved channels for Federal sales, in accordance with all applicable laws and manufacturer?s current applicable policies at the time of purchase. Seller must be able to support both the product sale and product pricing, in accordance with applicable manufacturer certification / specialization requirements. If software is provided or included, Seller shall, upon request, provide Buyer with a copy of the End User License Agreement. Seller certifies that all software is licensed originally to Buyer as the original licensee authorized to use the software. <BR> <BR>All bid prices must include shipping FOB Destination. No partial shipments are permitted, unless otherwise specified by Contracting Officer at time of award. <BR> <BR>Delivery order awards shall only be made to the firm that has the GSA FSS contract awarded to them.  The Government views a team arrangement as a prime and subcontractor relationship with the delivery order only being awarded to one GSA FSS holder.  To ensure compliance, prior to award the offeror MUST provide written proof from the GSA FSS contract holder that they have the right to offer the GSA schedule items on behalf of the GSA FSS holder; AND a statement that the offeror accepts that the government will make award to the GSA schedule contract holder as the sole awardee and they understand the Government will only accept invoices from and make payments to the GSA FSS contract holder.  ATTENTION: Should a solicitation be set aside for a specific socio-economic status, such as a small business, the FSS contract holder must meet the socio-economic requirement in order to be considered for award. <BR> <BR>GSA schedule orders may include "open market" items, i.e., items not on the awardee's list of GSA schedule items, only in compliance with FAR 8.402(f). Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items. For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101. In order to notate which items are open market, in accordance with FAR 8.402(f)(3), Seller must write "open market" in the Line Item Description for any item not currently active on the cited contract, or list in the Seller Bid Description field all open market line numbers (e.g. "Open Market Items: Lines 1, 2, 3.") <BR> <BR>

<CONTACT>Angela K. Zang, Phone 6182299435, Email angela.k.zang.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><p>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), Contracting Division, Systems Section (DITCO/PL8223), 2300 East Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5406, intends to issue a sole source award to General Dynamics C4 Systems, Inc. (GDC4S) to provide secure browsing licenses and associated policy modifications for up to 1,000 Department of Defense (DoD) Mobility Classified Capability (DMCC) Integrated Commercial Solution (ICS) Secret (DMCC-S) devices. <br /><br />These licenses and associated policies must be purchased and implemented through GDC4S to continue the existing National Security Administration (NSA) approved secure baseline configuration of the classified capability on the device. The GDC4S baseline configuration image is the only NSA device approved for use at the enterprise level for DMCC. The DMCC ICS device baseline configurations ensure interoperability amongst the DMCC components, providing the following capabilities; device integrity, secure browsing, secure email, secure voice, internet protocol security, virtual private network connectivity, policy enforcement and mobile device management. The license and policy updates required to meet the DMCC secure browsing capability will provide a NSA required encryption, managing the device security policies, actively monitoring threats to the device and providing a robust security layer to the entire device, enabling the secure browsing. GDC4S is the only approved trusted integrator on NSA's Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) integrator list that can readily support these required licenses with secure browsing modifications on the existing NSA approved DMCC ICS device baseline image.</p>
<p>The DMCC is a joint effort between the DISA and the NSA. In June 2014, the NSA competitively awarded integration contract, H98230-14-C-0596, to meet the DMCC Program needs. In addition to providing DISA with secure DMCC-S devices, this contract provided for the secure browsing capability, associated licensing and policy updates. The current licenses to support this capability expire in November 2015 and must be renewed to prevent Information Assurance (IA) security gaps on the device. This effort will ensure the registered DMCC-S user's device can operate securely.</p>
<p>The mobile license and policies required must provide device security management and encryption capability, mandated by NSA, to maintain the secure baseline configuration of the classified capability on the device. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>All responsible sources will be considered in evaluating the determination to issue a sole-source contract. Quotations or proposals received in response to this notice cannot be accepted since this synopsis cannot be considered a request for quote or a request for proposal.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to award a firm-fixed price contract in November 2015 with a period of performance of one year.</p>

<DESC>Chapter VI: Other Than Full and Open Competition (OFOC) SOP
Attachment 4:  Single Source Justification for SAP under $150K

OFOC SOP Revision 05   Page 1 of 2
Original Date: 03/22/11
Revision 05 Date: 05/02/2016
JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3.5K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID: 
618-17-1-029-0071
1A. PROJECT/TASK No.  NONE
1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$69,275.32
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:
Firm Fixed Price Sole Source Purchase Order for a one year supply of Stryker Orthopedics bone cement and bone cement w/antibiotic, 26 packages of HOWMEDICA 6191-1-010, 10 boxes of HV-Full Dose 6194-1-010, and 10 boxes of HOWMEDICA 6197-9-010. The Minneapolis VA does a large number of procedures that use various types of bone cement and the Simplex bone cements are specifically designed to penetrate into the pores of (porous) cancellous bones to achieve better bonding in joint replacement surgeries. The bone cement w/antibiotic is needed for reduction of risk for surgical site infection in specific orthopedic patient populations. The Simplex bone cement has proven to adequately penetrate the bone in patients that need the extra support.

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:
Stryker Orthopedics is the Original Equipment Manufacturer of this item. This bone cement is necessary for joint replacement surgery. The bone cement w/antibiotic is needed for reduction of risk for surgical site infection in specific orthopedic patient populations. This bone cement has proven to adequately penetrate the bone.  There are two available products Stryker and Zimmer; VA Clinicians have determined that both are required to be on hand so they can choose the cement that offers the best outcome for the patient. Stryker Simplex is the only known supplier of variable viscosity bone cement that demonstrates better penetration of cancellous bones.  Stryker Inc. is the manufacturer and sole distributer of this product and does not have authorized resellers.

4. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Market Research included internet searches, SAM was checked for registration status and the FSS Schedule 65 was checked for comparable products. Market research efforts showed there are only two suppliers found that carried bone cement, Stryker Orthopedics and Zimmer Medical. Each company manufacturers their cement for use with different types of bone densities and have been found to provide different surgical results depending on the patient. The VA Clinicians have requested that both types of cement be stocked for the Minneapolis Surgical Center so they have a choice of the product that is best suited to the patient s needs for a more likely positive outcome.  For the Stryker cement, GSA searched produced zero vendors for bone cement.  VETBIZ searches under, orthopedics, bone cement, and Stryker produced zero vendors.  VETBIZ search under  Bone  produced 19 vendors from which one vendor stated they could provide the bone cement.  Stryker Inc stated there are no authorized resellers of their bone cement including no VOSB/SDVOSB vendors so the VETBIZ quote is suspect.   

5. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. Note: COs are required to make a determination of price reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3.  See the Commercial Supply and Service SOP for Price Reasonableness templates.

JUSTIFICATION
FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.  Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
                                          Office of Acquisition Operations
             Technology Acquisition Center
             23 Christopher Way
             Eatontown, NJ 07724
            
2.  Description of Action:  This proposed action is for a firm-fixed-price delivery order issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) for brand name Computer Associates (CA) Application Program Interface (API) Manager software licenses and technical support.  

3.  Description of Supplies or Services:  VA, Office of Information and Technology, MyHealtheVet (MHV) has a requirement for eight Computer Associates (CA) Application Program Interface (API) Manager software licenses and technical support.  The CA API Manager acts as an API proxy that intercepts mobile and network traffic, allowing for various security and integration policies to be enforced within the VA network.  In addition this product provides operational capabilities to manage API performance as well as capabilities for developers to create new policies, generate analytics, and address API configurations.  It addresses the requirements of delivering an API Manager solution to ensure the 3.8 million Veterans that depend and use the VA s virtual health care may select either vets.gov, mobile devices or the MHV web portal.  The Contractor shall provide API Manager technical support in both MHV s non-production and production environments.  There are several API Manager instances that require technical support to include, but not limited to, the MHV production environment, the MHV System Test environment and MHV Integration B environment.  The Contractor shall provide API Manager technical support to VA and VA contractor personnel in support of the API Manager that supports MHV s APIs with troubleshooting of problems as well as repair of API Manager specific problems in both MHV Production and Non-production environments.  This technical support shall include technical information concerning the proper operation of the MHV APIs that interface with the API Manager product.  The Contractor shall provide API Manager technical support to ensure a level of abstraction that provides minimal disruption to MHV development team and environments.  The Contractor shall provide support to oversee routine API Manager activities that include guiding and prioritize the API Manger workload.  The Contractor shall provide technical support that will provide a common methodology to develop, integrate and sustain MHV APIs.  Delivery is required within 30 days of award.  The period of performance shall be 12 months from date of delivery, plus two 12-month option periods, if exercised.  

4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting this exception to fair opportunity is 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled  Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized. 

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  Based on market research, as described in section eight of this justification, it was determined that limited competition is available among authorized resellers for the required brand name CA Software licenses and technical support.  The CA API Manager solution provides a comprehensive API identity broker as well as a policy-based transformation, prioritization, security, caching and traffic control services that are immediately needed for the MHV API that are being used by vets.gov and VA mobile devices.  This solution is the only API Manager that satisfies both Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 and Common Criteria for Access Control and Policy allowing the government to use security standards used to accredit cryptographic modules.  The CA API Manager s Identity Broker includes an onboard Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) security token service for federation and credential translation, allowing for authorization data between parties, in particular, between an identity provider and service provider.  CA API Manger is the only API Manager product that is integrated with Axiomatics Policy Server, which allows for fine-grained policies to enforce user permissions and govern access to Veteran health data.  CA API Manager solution streamlines the identity, authorization and access use of both open standard for authorization and SAML to increase the security of data MHV shares with vets.gov and VA mobile devices.  Currently, CA software is the only software which can seamlessly integrate with the VA s Identity Access Management (IAM) Shared Services platform that is built on CA s Identity Management and CA s Single Sign On (SSO).

Additionally VA requires technical support from CA, through an authorized reseller.  All software manufacturers continually enhance, patch, and update their products.  Non-open source software products, such as CA, utilize proprietary code in their software products in order to protect their intellectual property.  Therefore, no other source can provide the needed software enhancements, patches, and updates.  

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in section eight of this justification.  This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government s requirements.  It was determined that limited competition is viable among authorized resellers for the required brand name software licenses that hold current NASA SEWP V GWACs.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D), notice of award of this action will be synopsized and this justification will be made publicly available within 14 days of award on the Federal Business Opportunities Page.  In accordance with FAR 16.505(a)(4)(iii)(A), this justification will be posted with the request for quotation on the NASA SEWP V GWAC website to notify all interested parties.

7.   Actions to Increase Competition:  In order to remove barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the agency will work with the program office to perform additional market research so that other solutions can be considered.  The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place that would enable future actions to be competed.

8.   Market Research:  The Government s technical experts conducted market research in June of 2016 by reviewing similar software products to ascertain if these items could meet VA s requirements.  Specifically, the Government s technical experts conducted web-based research on software solutions offered by IBM, Oracle, and Apigee.  VA reviewed each of the possible sources  product information and it was determined that only CA software meets VA s requirements.  Based upon reviews of these products, the Government s technical experts determined that none of these products can meet the Government s functionality, interoperability and compatibility requirements for comprehensive API identity broker as well as a policy-based transformation, prioritization, security, caching and traffic control services that are required for vets.gov and VA mobile devices as discussed in section five above. No other solutions can seamlessly integrate with the VA s IAM Shared Services platform that is built on CA s Identity Management and CA s SSO.  Additionally, as stated above in section five, only CA API or an authorized reseller can provide the required software licenses and technical support.  The Government s technical experts have determined that only CA API brand name software licenses and technical support can meet all of VA s needs.

Additional market research was conducted in September 2016 by utilizing the NASA SEWP Provider Lookup tool to determine whether the brand name CA API software licenses and technical support is available from NASA SEWP V GWAC holders.  It was determined that there are several resellers of the brand name CA API software licenses and technical support that hold current GWACs such that limited competition is anticipated.

9.  Other Facts:  None.
