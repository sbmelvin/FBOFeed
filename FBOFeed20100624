<DESC>Request for Information (RFI): Business Rules Management System________________________________________Notice Number: Key DatesRelease Date: 18 June 2010 Response Date: 25 June 2010Issued by554 ELSG/PNK, Ms Rebecca Rounsavill554 ELSG/PNF, Mr. Thomas Talcott
This is not a solicitation for proposals nor is it a request to perform work. The Government will not pay for any information, documentation, and/or data submitted in response to this notice. Responses will be used to identify potential sources, potential business arrangements, market conditions, and an assessment of solutions and products and their potential to satisfy the subject requirement.IntroductionThe 554th Electronic Systems Group (ELSG) is preparing to enhance Air Force's HR Service Oriented Architecture through the possible implementation of a business rule management system (BRMS). This initial BRMS will be a pathfinder with initial limited use, to investigate the viability of such a tool in the current Business and IT structure.  This product is expected to be Commercial off the Shelf (COTS).   The BRMS product should have the capability to enable organizational policies - and the operational decisions associated with personnel management policies, such as Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) management, assignment selection assistance, associated calculations and eligibility determinations - to be defined, deployed, monitored and maintained separately from other application code. This off-the-shelf software will need to provide the ability for non-technical business users to be directly involved in rule management and enable flexible decision automation for applications and processes that are subject to complex, variable and evolving rules. This BRMS solution will need to automate policies in custom and composite business applications. It is expected that the BRMS will lower application maintenance costs, facilitate more accurate and consistent business policy implementation across various applications, and improve collaboration between business and IT departments. The BRMS software will need to integrate with the current IBM WebSphere products.  No hardware is planned to be purchased.The contractor will provide the associated labor for the integration of BRMS to retrieve personnel data from an authoritative data source without having to recreate this data in the projected new system or requirement. The developer/integrator of these BRMS service could also be the integrator of future requirements. The 554 ELSG Program Office is especially interested in creative suggestions, even if they involve radical changes to the current approach.  Background AF/A1 is responsible for a portfolio of approximately 150 IT systems that convey personnel data for military and civilian personnel.   This effort may include data from the primary HR systems of MilPDS for the military and DCPDS for civilian personnel.   Proposed Technical Approach Interfacing Systems:Below is a list of legacy programs may be integrated with the BRMS. Virtual Personnel Service Center (VPSC) :-	Airman Development Plan (ADP)-	Personnel Records Display Application (PRDA)-	Role Based Access (RBA)
Information RequestThe 554 ELSG Program Office welcomes your comments on the requirement provided and associated activities; particularly on how to enhance and automate the future process by leveraging experiences you have had in utilizing a BRMS system. The Program Office is especially interested in creative suggestions to the following questions: Challenges of new System Requirements:Please describe any specific risks or challenges presented by this document.  Also, point out any vague statements or inconsistencies that may eventually lead to changes in the technical approach.1.	Solutions to ChallengesPlease, describe your COTS product.  Feel free to describe general approaches or concepts that would address any integration challenges, while limiting the approach to the implementation of Business Rules Management.2.	Suggested Hardware and SoftwareAny new Hardware/Software should be adaptable to current government equipment. The BRMS software will need to integrate with the current IBM WebSphere products.  3.	Suggested Contract Vehicle and ApproachPlease, suggest the preferred contract vehicles currently through which we can contract your product and services.Technical Specifications  A Customer Need Statement or a System Requirement Statement using comments provided from this RFI may be provided in any future Request for Proposal. How to Submit a ResponseResponses will be accepted until June 29, 2010 through the following e-mail address: ELSG.PNKWorkflow@randolph.af.mil and Thomas.talcott.ctr@randolph.af.mil. The form will limit the length of each response to the number of characters identified.
The collected information will be analyzed and may appear in reports. Although the Program Office will try to protect against the release of identifying information there is no guarantee of confidentiality.
As this is an RFI document, initial prospective business responses should be in the form of a COTS Capability Statement.

Responses will be used to identify potential sources, potential business arrangements, market conditions, and an assessment of solutions and products and their potential to satisfy the subject requirement.IntroductionThe 554th Electronic Systems Group (ELSG) is preparing to enhance Air Force's HR Service Oriented Architecture through the possible implementation of a business rule management system (BRMS). This initial BRMS will be a pathfinder with initial limited use, to investigate the viability of such a tool in the current Business and IT structure.  This product is expected to be Commercial off the Shelf (COTS).   The BRMS product should have the capability to enable organizational policies - and the operational decisions associated with personnel management policies, such as Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) management, assignment selection assistance, associated calculations and eligibility determinations - to be defined, deployed, monitored and maintained separately from other application code. This off-the-shelf software will need to provide the ability for non-technical business users to be directly involved in rule management and enable flexible decision automation for applications and processes that are subject to complex, variable and evolving rules. This BRMS solution will need to automate policies in custom and composite business applications. It is expected that the BRMS will lower application maintenance costs, facilitate more accurate and consistent business policy implementation across various applications, and improve collaboration between business and IT departments. The BRMS software will need to integrate with the current IBM WebSphere products.  No hardware is planned to be purchased.The contractor will provide the associated labor for the integration of BRMS to retrieve personnel data from an authoritative data source without having to recreate this data in the projected new system or requirement. The developer/integrator of these BRMS service could also be the integrator of future requirements. The 554 ELSG Program Office is especially interested in creative suggestions, even if they involve radical changes to the current approach.  Background AF/A1 is responsible for a portfolio of approximately 150 IT systems that convey personnel data for military and civilian personnel.   This effort may include data from the primary HR systems of MilPDS for the military and DCPDS for civilian personnel.

This contract is for the design, fabrication, delivery and installation of all the exhibit components. Installation of exhibits shall be accomplished in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, museum and Center of Military History (CMH) standards and the PWS.  <BR><BR>The museum exhibit plan shall be installed in three complete/stand-alone phases in the renovated BCT Museum building, a structure with a total exhibit space of approximately 7850 square feet.  All phases must include the history of BCT from 1917 to present, to be presented in four galleries: WWI, WWII, Cold War, and Current.  Each gallery covers 15 topics using a combination of text, graphics, and displays; the number of artifacts on display and components for coverage will vary dependent upon square footage of each phase.  For all phases, fabrication will be done with the gallery phase expansions in mind to allow mobility and growth of each of the four gallery areas as square footage increases. The contractor will be required to develop an exhibit design layout of the completed BCT Museum to include lighting, graphics, fixtures and the development of a 3-phased installation plan of the exhibit design layout.   The phases will be completed in a turnkey fashion and complete and usable upon completion of each phase. The contractor will be required to transport all fabricated and purchased exhibit components to the US Army Basic Combat Training Museum, install all exhibit components, and assist the BCT Museum staff in the installation of historic objects. This complete exhibit design will become the property of the US government and will be used for future phase installation.  Phase I is a 4,090 sq. ft. section of exhibit fabrication and installation, one hologram machine created with available technology, and a Heroes Among Us gallery which will incorporate a mobile conference table and 6-8 chairs.  Phase II will incorporate a 1,850 sq. ft. section, and Phase III will add a 1,910 sq. ft. section. All phases will include one hologram machine each created with available technology.  <BR><BR>The Government has determined the price range for this requirement to be $80.00-$100.00 per sq. ft.<BR>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement to acquire and test approximately 7 dB Systems, Inc.'s Model 350 Glide Slope (GS) Antennas to support 2 systems and 1 spare.
This market survey announces the FAA's intent to award a single source contract to dB Systems, Inc., 2005 South Turf Sod Road, Hurricana, UT  84737. 
The present GS antennas used with the MK-20 and MK-20A ILSs barely meet the ICAO continuity of service requirement (CoS) of 4000 hours.  This causes many of the CAT II/III ILSs to be downgraded to CAT I causing a negative impact on capacity and an increase in the cost of precision approach services.  
Over the past two years, antennas from several antenna manufactures were evaluated by FAA for design improvements to meet current requirements without success.  Additionally, FAA has redesigned some of the current antennas in an attempt to meet the CoS requirements also without success.  FAA has reviewed dB System's proposed totally new, preliminary design for a more stable GS antenna.  To assure total compliance with our specifications, FAA intend to task dB Systems to manufacture the antenna and conduct appropriate verification testing.  A fair and reasonable price will be negotiated for all deliverables under this procurement.  
A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to this announcement nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding hereto. 

Questions are comments must be received by Greg Rugila at greg.rugila@faa.gov not later than July 30, 2010.

<DESC>This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award any contracts now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time. The purpose of this pre solicitation notice is to advertise that the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is contracting to replace the main and lobby elevators in Building 1 of the NIST Boulder Campus in Boulder, Colorado.
<p>The Government intends to solicit this acquisition for unrestricted (full and open) competition. The requirement is assigned a NAICS code of 236220 with a small business size standard of $33.5M. Although this procurement is not set aside for small business, small firms (including woman-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, Veteran-Owned, and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned) are strongly encouraged to participate in the construction and renovation of Federal facilities. In accordance with 15 USC 631, large businesses will be required to provide these small firms the maximum practical opportunities to participate in the performance of this contract. Each large business will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan that meets, and preferably exceeds, the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals established by the Small Business Administration (SBA). An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of contract. Small businesses are not subject to this requirement. However, ALL firms seeking consideration for this contract will need to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest possible subcontracting goals for local (Denver/Boulder) business concern participation. Please refer to the SBA website for additional details at www.sba.gov.</p>
<p>It is important to note that in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.236-1, Performance of Work by the Contractor, the prime contractor is required to perform at least 50% of the labor with their own employees for general construction. For further information on the requirements for general construction and/or special trade construction, please visit the following web sites:</p>
<p>http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/print.pl/oes/2001/oesi2_17.htm</p>
<p>http://www.census.gov/epcd/naics/NDEF235.HTM</p>
<p><br />The objective of this acquisition is to remove the existing main elevator and lobby elevators located in Building #1 and replace the elevators with new elevators, control panels, and machine equipment. The primary reason in replacing the main elevator is to provide a modernized elevator that will serve as a passenger/freight elevator as well as floor to floor transportation for scientific equipment and materials. The elevator will showcase state-of-the-art VIP control technology to transport scientific equipment "unmanned" floor to floor which will provide immediate safety to the building's community and visitors as critically sensitive equipment will not need to be accompanied by personnel.</p>
<p>The lobby elevator will also provide an essential need for citizens requiring ADA access from the main lobby level to the main elevator level which allows access to the remaining floors. The lobby elevator will be code compliant in dimension and requirement to house wheelchairs, walkers, and strollers.</p>
<p>The replacement elevators will be "Green" sensitive as the side wall support shaft piers will not penetrate the earth's surface, instead supports will rest on concrete plates above ground which eliminate contact with the surface of the environment.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be released on or about July 9, 2010, with a proposal due date approximately thirty (30) days thereafter, and an award anticipated for August, 2010. The estimated price range of this project is $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00. A pre-proposal conference has been scheduled for Wednesday, July 20, 2010 from 10:00am - 12:00pm at the Auditorium of the NIST Boulder Campus, located at 325 Broadway in Boulder, Colorado. Information regarding the conference will be contained in the solicitation posting. Completion time for this project is approximately 90 calendars days (the final duration will be detailed in the solicitation) after the written Notice to Proceed.</p>
<p>Source selection will be made using lowest price technically acceptable source selection process (FAR 15.101-2). The government will not pay for any information solicited. Offers that do not meet all the technical requirements or price reasonableness will not be considered. All offerors who do not meet the minimum requirements will be notified as soon as they have been determined not to be in consideration any longer. Any late proposal received is subject to FAR 52.214-7 Late submissions, Modifications, and withdrawals of Bids (NOV 1999).</p>
<p>THE TECHNICAL DATA, SPECIFICATIONS AND DRAWINGS, WILL BE AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST ONCE THE SOLICITATION HAS BEEN ISSUED ON OR ABOUT JULY 9, 2010. EMAIL A REQUEST TO TIFFANY.ATCHISON@NIST.GOV REFERENCING THE SOLICITATION NUMBER (SB1341-10-RP-0084) AFTER THE SOLICITATION IS RELEASED IN FEDBIZOPPS. THE SOLICITATION WILL BE RELEASED ON OR ABOUT JULY 9, 2010. PLEASE DO NOT REQUEST THE SOLICITATION PRIOR TO THE SOLICITATION HAVING BEEN POSTED.</p>
<p>IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE PLEASE CONTACT TIFFANY ATCHISON AT TIFFANY.ATCHISON@NIST.GOV OR JASON GERLOFF AT JGERLOFF@NIST.GOV .</p>
<p>As a reminder, all contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). To register with the CCR and ORCA and become eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier.

<p>Description<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, plans to procure on a sole source basis the services of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), 150 Cours Albert-Thomas, 69008 Lyon France to conduct a study of the determinants of survival in renal cancer patients from Moscow.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $7.0M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve months from date of award.</p>
<p>To conduct a study of the determinants of renal cancer survival among cases enrolled in Moscow, the largest participating center in the Central and Eastern European Renal Cancer Case-Control Study.  The contractor shall collect information on survival status from vital statistics records, including the date and cause of death, and date of last follow-up, and treatment information from medical and cancer registry records from the hospitals in which cases were initially treated and/or continue to be evaluated post-diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>Moscow enrolled 317 eligible cases. Additional information to abstract includes surgical and medical treatment procedures for the primary disease, recurrence and progression of primary disease, and incidence of secondary cancers.</p>
<p>In 2000 , investigators at the IARC launched a case-control study of lung cancer in six centers in Central and Eastern European countries (i.e., Bucharest, Romania, Brno, Olomouc, and Prague, Czech Republic; Lodz, Poland; and Moscow, Russia) to evaluate risks in relation to occupational exposures and lifestyle factors.  Field work for the Central and Eastern European Renal Cell Case-Control study was completed in 2002. Since 2002, analyses have been conducted on risk factors (occupational and environmental exposures, pathology, genetic susceptibility markers) for kidney cancer.  The proposed contract shall take advantage of collaborations and infrastructure currently in place for completion of this study in Moscow cases.   IARC is the only known source capable of coordinating the completion effort in Moscow patients that they initially recruited as part of the Central and Eastern European Renal Cancer (CEERCC) Case-Control Study.</p>
<p>IARC is the only known source able to conduct this study with collaborations in place with all of the participating centers.  IARC collaborated with each of the study centers to identify the cases in a case-control study, and hence IARC has exclusive access to cases at each study center to examine their survival that cannot be provided by any other research groups. There are no other known sources that meet this criteria, no other known sources are able to conduct this type of study with familiarity of the main study, that could also oversee all collaborations. IARC is the only known source with the capability to collect this information in various languages, across this region of the world.  Because of the infrastructure already in place, and through our experience in the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch in conducting survival studies in the US and other parts of the world, IARC is uniquely qualified to perform this work.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on July 8, 2010.  No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax), an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference solicitation number NCI-100105-MM on all correspondence.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) is an intramural research program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) that conducts population and multidisciplinary research to discover the genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and new approaches to cancer prevention.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Telomeres are non-coding DNA repeats at chromosome ends that help preserve genomic structural integrity.<span>&nbsp; </span>Telomeric repeats progressively shorten with each cell division and, when critically short, they induce normal cells to undergo cellular senescence or apoptosis.<span>&nbsp; </span>Malignant cells, lacking a normal DNA damage response (e.g<em>.</em>, loss of wild type <em>TP53</em>), can bypass this crisis state and continue to divide.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore, critical telomere shortening may result in genetic instability in these cells.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many case-control studies have observed an association between shorter telomeres in constitutional DNA and bladder, breast, head and neck, lung, and renal cell cancers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Brigham &amp; Women&rsquo;s Hospital has one of a very limited number of laboratories that currently has an operating telomere assay. This is the only assay that allows high throughput measurement of telomere length in a 384-well format using very little amount of DNA. DCEG has made significant investments in collecting the limited tissues in epidemiological studies. Several molecular efforts need to be performed from DNA extracted from the limited tissue. At the same time, the large numbers of cases and controls in DCEG&rsquo;s epidemiological studies require highly standardized high-throughput assays to make sure that the results are comparable and obtained in a timely fashion. The other techniques available (Southern blot, FISH) require large amounts of DNA that are not available within these studies and lack high-throughput capabilities rendering these techniques unsuitable for the proposed epidemiological studies.</p>

<RESPDATE>112009
<ARCHDATE>06252010
<CONTACT>Mike Kilbane 202-781-1395
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to post a solicitation for up to three Technology Development Contracts for the Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) S-band Radar and Radar Suite Controller.  NAVSEA intends to award up to three Fixed Price Incentive Fee contracts via full and open competition.  The solicitation will be issued electronically via http://www.neco.navy.mil.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided or mailed.  Interested offerors should monitor FEDBIZOPPS for the release of the solicitation.  Since this solicitation, and any applicable amendments, will be issued electronically, the Government is under no obligation to maintain a bidder's mailing list.  If the Government makes the decision to proceed to the Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase, after processing a Justification and Approval (J&A), there will be a limited competition between the successful offerors of the TD phase for the EMD phase contract.
AMDR is envisioned as a radar suite designed to be scalable to accommodate current and future mission requirements for multiple platforms. AMDR will consist of an S-band radar (AMDR-S), an X-band radar (AMDR-X) and a Radar Suite Controller (RSC).  The AMDR-S will provide volume search, tracking, Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) discrimination, and missile communications.  The AMDR-X will provide horizon search, precision tracking, missile communication and terminal illumination. Both radars will be integrated into a suite by the RSC.  The RSC will provide the appropriate interfaces between the AMDR-S, AMDR-X, and combat system.  The RSC will perform all coordinating actions to ensure that both radars operate in concert in a widely diverse environment.  This solicitation will address the AMDR-S and RSC technology development of the AMDR suite through a Technology Development Review (TDR) and a Preliminary Design Review (PDR).
IMPORTANT:  In order to be considered for contract award, each company must have a TOP SECRET facility clearance and must be a United States (US) company or an independent US subsidiary.  However, foreign contractors may act as subcontractors to U.S. primes contractors.  The export of defense articles, defense services, and related technical data is subject to the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and requires the issuance of an export license by the U.S. Department of State. 
There will be classified attachments at the SECRET/US Only level to the solicitation.  These classified documents will be supplied on a CD/DVD which will be mailed separately.  Only one copy of the classified CD/DVD will be distributed per cleared pre-solicitation notice respondent.  To obtain these classified attachments, interested offerors must completely fill out the "Classified Material Request Form" which is attached to this pre-solicitation notice.  This information should be submitted to Brian Wessmiller via e-mail at brian.wessmiller@navy.mil with a copy to richelle.wright@navy.mil and mike.kilbane@navy.mil.  Once approved, the Government will be able to mail a classified CD/DVD to the respondent if a solicitation is issued.
This pre-solicitation notice is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.  Disclaimer:  This pre-solicitation notice is for information only, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award contracts.  The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept, proposals as a result of this synopsis.  If a solicitation is issued in the future, it will be announced via FEDBIZOPPS/NECO and interested parties must comply with that announcement.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice.

<DESC>The Hull Systems Automation Group (Code 6160), of the Carderock Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWCCD) has a requirement for (1) VideoRay Pro3 GTO Remotely Operated Video (ROV) Submersible only and two controller boxes.
In support of this effort, NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and award a firm-fixed price purchase order to Video Ray 580 Wall Street, Phoenixville, PA 19460-0000. 
The small business set-aside has been dis-solved. 
The VideoRay ROV has been used by NSWCCD for the purposes of performing underwater ship hull inspections. Code 616 has a requirement for spares and a complete second system to provide required support to the program. The new ROV system must be compatible with the current system because of the Navy's investment in training, spare parts and interchangeable support equipment. The VideoRay ROV is compatible with existing Navy systems and switching to another ROV manufacturer would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and unacceptable schedule delays in fulfilling the agencies requirement.
All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 5 p.m on 7/9/2010, referencing RFQ N00167-10-T-0099.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a full and open competition for the project entitled "Workload, Situational Awareness, and Teamwork."
<p>The NRC staff reviews the human factors engineering (HFE) programs of applicants for construction permits, operating licenses, standard design certifications, and combined operating licenses to ensure that personnel performance and reliability are appropriately supported. The NRC's HFE review guidelines involve assessment of human performance including workload, SA, and teamwork. The objectives of this contract is to develop a knowledge base, guidelines, and tools for evaluating the safety aspects of human performance associated with advanced technologies in NPP control stations. The results will be used in NRC's licensing and safety activities such as license application reviews, inspections, and risk-informed decision-making. The goals of this project are to provide a knowledge base and tools to assist in the evaluation of human performance. The project will take the following approach to achieve these goals: 1) develop a knowledge base of methods of assessing workload, SA, and teamwork, and develop guidelines of evaluating the feasibility and validity of the methods with respect to NPP control stations; 2) identify, adapt or hybridize, an analytic method of assessing the generic human performance measurements specific to NPP control room stations; and 3) experimentally test one or more methods to provide guidance for the NRC staff to use the methods and link the assessment results to plant safety. The deliverables from this project will be used for the HFE practices in the NRC's licensing review and safety activities.</p>

he U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a full and open competition for the project entitled "Workload, Situational Awareness, and Teamwork."
<p>The NRC staff reviews the human factors engineering (HFE) programs of applicants for construction permits, operating licenses, standard design certifications, and combined operating licenses to ensure that personnel performance and reliability are appropriately supported. The NRC's HFE review guidelines involve assessment of human performance including workload, SA, and teamwork. The objectives of this contract is to develop a knowledge base, guidelines, and tools for evaluating the safety aspects of human performance associated with advanced technologies in NPP control stations. The results will be used in NRC's licensing and safety activities such as license application reviews, inspections, and risk-informed decision-making. The goals of this project are to provide a knowledge base and tools to assist in the evaluation of human performance. The project will take the following approach to achieve these goals: 1) develop a knowledge base of methods of assessing workload, SA, and teamwork, and develop guidelines of evaluating the feasibility and validity of the methods with respect to NPP control stations; 2) identify, adapt or hybridize, an analytic method of assessing the generic human performance measurements specific to NPP control room stations; and 3) experimentally test one or more methods to provide guidance for the NRC staff to use the methods and link the assessment results to plant safety. The deliverables from this project will be used for the HFE practices in the NRC's licensing review and safety activities.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Government is considering whether to expand at the existing location or to relocate to
alternative space which can meet the entire space requirement. In making this determination, the
Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially
can satisfy the Governments entire requirement for a four year term, as well as costs likely to be
incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and
telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, rent payments on vacant
space under the existing lease or cost of buyout, etc.

This effort will support national critical infrastructure protection responsibilities led by USACE under the USACE Critical Infrastructure Protection and Resilience (CIPR) program and the Dam Safety portfolio development.  <BR><BR>The USACE's vision is to achieve a safe, secure, and more resilient Corps civil works infrastructure by enhancing its protection in order to prevent, deter, or mitigate the potential for dam failure and improve preparedness, response, and rapid recovery in the event of an attack, natural disaster, and other emergencies.  A major initiative within this effort involves the development of updated dam break flood models, inundation mapping and consequence estimates. Other components of this initiative include: <BR><BR>"	Applying and testing H&H modeling and GIS mapping capabilities.<BR>"	Identify standard scenario conditions as a foundation for Dam Safety Emergency Action Plans (EAPs) mapping requirements.<BR>"	Incorporate into USACE inundation maps guidance for above normal operational dam control conditions. <BR>"	Leverage H&H modeling and GIS mapping capabilities and resources via close coordination with USACE Dam Safety Directorate of Expertise (DX).<BR><BR>This program is managed out of the Vicksburg District.  To accomplish program requirements it is necessary for the Vicksburg District to staff numerous H&H production teams consisting of members from across the Corps, and to augment these resources with engineering contracts.  These teams consist of hydraulic engineers, GIS specialists, and economists and are currently named as the USACE Mapping, Modeling and Consequence Team (MMC).  Contracted work will be for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other Federal agencies.  <BR><BR>Services of qualified A-E firms are sought to provide modeling, mapping, and consequences assessment production services, support in developing engineering documentation and procedures, and performing review of products developed by MMC production teams.  The Contractor will work closely with USACE modeling, mapping, and consequences leads to improve processes, efficiency, and productivity.  Projects to be performed or reviewed by the Contractor will be selected by the USACE technical leads.  <BR><BR>3. SELECTION CRITERIA:  Pre-selection will be based on the following considerations, which are listed in descending order of importance.  Criteria A thru D are primary.  Criteria E thru G are secondary and will only be used as a tie-breaker, if necessary, in ranking the most highly qualified firms.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center (AAC), 308th Armament Systems Wing, 808th Armament Systems Group, 685th Armament Systems Squadron, Eglin AFB, FL is conducting a market survey for the manufacturing of empty BLU-129/B warheads in support of the Precision Lethality MK82 program. Precision Lethality MK82 is a Quick Reaction Capability acquisition program to field a 500-lb composite case warhead (BLU-129) capability in response to a United States Central Command Joint Urgent Operational Need for a very low collateral damage weapon.
<p>On 29 March 2010, the OSD Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell directed the Department of the Air Force to rapidly develop and field the BLU-129 using the same composite case warhead and Multi-phase Blast Explosive technologies used in the 250-lb Small Diameter Bomb Focused Lethality Munition weapon. In May 2010, the Air Force Reseach Laboratory (AFRL) funded Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), a Federally Funded Research and Development Center, to complete a 3-month effort to mature their 2005 500-lb warhead design to meet the BLU-129 operational performance requirements. Upon completion of the design update, AAC will work with LLNL to test warhead performance, integrate it with Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and Laser JDAM guidance kits, and certify the weapon for fielding as early as the 1st quarter of CY2011.</p>
<p>AAC plans to award a contract in August 2010 for manufacturing of 125-175 warheads to support the test program. Assuming successful test results, a one-time production option for 400-600 empty warheads will be awarded in the December 2010 timeframe to support BLU-129/B fielding, with the initial 50 qualified warheads available NLT January 2011 and the final warheads delivered within 12 months of initial deliveries. The Government will perform fill of the empty warheads. This schedule is necessary to meet the urgent need requirement. The warheads must be manufactured in conformance with LLNL-designed drawings and manufacturing procedures. These procedures will involve carbon-fiber-wound construction of the warhead casing and integrated steel components.</p>
<p>No foreign participation is allowed for this effort. All respondents must have a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics and have the necessary organizational and technical experience, or the ability to obtain them in the necessary timeframe, including such elements as production management and control, quality assurance measures, and safety programs applicable to materials to be produced or services to be performed by the prospective contractor and subcontractors. Competence in these areas shall be demonstrated through written description of the vendors past and/or current experience of manufacturing fiber-wound composite structures. The respondent interested in producing the BLU-129/B warhead must be able to complete a qualification program and produce the warheads in the time frame required and with the quality necessary to maintain warhead performance.</p>
<p>Interested sources should submit their information no later than 9 July 2010 to Capt Branndon Teffeteller at branndon.teffeteller@eglin.af.mil and to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Grisselle Nusimow, at grisselle.nusimow@eglin.af.mil. Submittals should include the contractor's name, CAGE code, DUNS number, address, point of contact, telephone number, email address, and size of business. All submissions must be in electronic format of no more than five (5) pages of 12 font type and should include a specific discussion of the sources capability to meet the required schedule.<br />This market survey is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the US Government. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part any private sector input as a result of this market survey. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the result of this survey.</p>

<DESC>This notification is for market research purposes only to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for Hill Air Force Base, UT and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished. This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid.
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The A-10 aircraft is an aging weapon system and is technically complex. The A-10 weapon system maintenance (MX) Trouble-Shooting (TS) documentation, for the Central Interface Control Unit, (CICU), the 1A-10C-2-40TS-9, T.O. (Tech Order, titled: Automated Weapons Management Systems ((AWMS)), is technically complex and incomplete. As a result, MX field-level deficiencies are often compounded by the lack of complete tech data, and associated TS information, which results in incorrect analysis, and premature removal of the weapons system avionics, typically the CICU.</p>
<p>Requirement:</p>
<p>The update of this 1A-10C-2-40TS-9 TO requires detailed aircraft and weapons system level avionics, i.e. CICU, knowledge, trouble shooting expertise using the Portable Automated Test Set (PATS), and sustainment evaluation expertise beyond what is available in the A-10 Program Office.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services intends to award a contract to the American Association of Motor Vehicles Administrators (AAMVA) on a sole source basis to expand its Verification of Lawful Status (VLS) program which provides State motor vehicle agencies (DMV) with an alternative point of access to the USCIS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlement (SAVE) system. This requirement includes the following: (1) end-to-end testing, a testing reporting process, and a certification requirement; (2) enhance the existing system to include multi-step verification; (3) develop a separate capability to query and verify passport data; (4) reporting requirements and a service level agreement for Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) activities to support additional states as they implement VLS and the Passport Verification System (PVS) and move into an operational status; (5) enhance VLS with Immigration photos to provide similar photo tool capability to DMVs that is currently available in E-Verify; (6) VLS web and Internet Services which will provide jurisdictions, including the territories, additional methods to access SAVE and other verifications systems available through AAMVA including the Social Security On Line Verification System (SSOLV).
<p>The messaging software used for VLS, as well as for the other AAMVA interfaces with the state DMVs, is the Unified Network Interface (UNI) product. UNI is a proprietary product and is solely owned by AAMVA. The existing VLS system was built by AAMVA and developed with the UNI. This requirement involves a variety of enhancements to the existing VLS systems developed by AAMVA.</p>
<p>The UNI product provides messaging functionality between the user's host (in this case a DMV mainframe or the DHS Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)) and fills an "interface" role between a site's application systems (e.g., DMV driver licensing system) and the telecommunications network (AAMVAnet).<br /><br />Interested Parties shall identify their capability to meet this requirement by submitting a capability statement by the due date stated within the sources sought notice. The Government is not requesting a proposal and this RFI in no way obligates the Government to place and order.</p>

<DESC>ALTERNATE POINT OF CONTACT    MARIA ROSU - (718) 553-3084DUE TO SECURITY REGULATIONS NO HAND CARRIED QUALIFICATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED
The existing Airport Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) at the LaGuardia Airport, Flushing, NY is to be selectively demolished to reduce the ATCT in height and then converted into a Storage structure.  LaGuardia Airport is owned and operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.  The project consists of selectively de-constructing an existing 136-foot concrete Airport Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) from the top of the ATCT to the 4th floor ceiling.  This includes removing the existing ASDE-3, Penthouse, cab of the ATCT and the concrete structure itself.  Also included is Asbestos Abatement, PCB light ballast recycling, lead sheathed copper cable recycling, and exit sign disposal.  Upon completion of demolition, the fourth floor roof will be reconstructed with the addition of a parapet, new roofing membrane, and new elevator shaft enclosure.  Additionally there will be new HVAC units, a new Fire Alarm System, a new Sprinkler system and a new elevator room constructed within the building as per the contract drawings. The site is constrained by American Airlines aircraft, passenger gates and Concourse D of the Central Terminal Building. Concourse D is a finger of the Central Terminal Building where American Airlines loads and unloads passengers into waiting aircraft.  The lower portion of the existing ATCT is an integral part of the Concourse D structure and must remain intact.  Exterior scaffolding with screening and debris netting will be required to be installed around the structure which will be supported on a temporary work platform that will be supported by the structure itself.   The scaffolding cannot extend down to ground level, except in one location for the stairs and hoist, due to the proximity of the American Airlines Aircraft gates.  The Airport and American Airlines will remain operational throughout the entire demolition contract.  All work inside of the ATCT shall be performed during normal working hours of 7:00AM - 4:30PM.  All ATCT exterior wall structural demolition work (all work which requires the removal of concrete pieces, rubble etc.) will be performed during overnight hours of 10:00PM - 4:00AM.  These overnight hours will be the only time the work can occur which will impact the operation of American Airlines gates.  All debris must be removed from the facility during the over night hours only.  Debris cannot be carried through the terminal or concourse areas.  Debris must be trucked off site via the PANYNJ Guard Post gate specified for the project.  The existing site location results in very limited site access. It is on the secure side of the Airport.  This results in very strict security and escorting requirements for all Contractor personnel.  No staging area or storage of material is available on site.  No Contractor equipment may remain in the gate areas during the hours of 4:00AM - 10:00PM.  All Contractor Equipment must be brought into the Aircraft Gate area on a daily basis.
Estimated time frame for Construction: January 24, 2011 to September 24, 2011Estimated Cost of Construction: $5 Million - $6 MillionNAICCS CODE - 238910

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  No solicitation is available. This RFI is released pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e), Exchanges with Industry.
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is currently in the acquisition planning stage for the potential award of a contract for the continuation of Idaho Clean-up Project (ICP) activities to take place at the U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory (INL) located in the southeastern Idaho desert.  Since its inception in 1949, the Idaho Site has fulfilled numerous DOE missions including designing and testing nuclear reactors; reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to recover fissile materials; managing spent nuclear fuel; and storing, treating and disposing of various waste streams.  Currently, the Office of Environmental Management (EM) serves as a tenant on the site, for which the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology (NE) serves as the landlord.  EM has the complex-wide mission of cleaning up contaminated sites and disposing of radioactive waste left behind as a byproduct of nuclear weapons production, nuclear powered naval vessels and commercial nuclear energ y production.
In May 2002, the Department of Energy, the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency signed a letter of intent formalizing an agreement to pursue accelerated risk reduction and cleanup at the INL to achieve the following vision: "By 2012, the INL will have achieved significant risk reduction and will have placed materials in safe storage ready for disposal."  While this goal has been achieved, there are still risk reduction and mission critical environmental management activities that need to be completed.  
The ICP Recompete will focus on the remaining work including stabilization and disposition of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste, completion of targeted buried waste retrieval, final closure of the tank farm and maintenance of CERCLA remediations.  The ICP Recompete is responsible for the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC), the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC), and the CERCLA remediation of the entire Site.  ICP receives waste for treatment from the Material and Fuel Complex (MFC) and transports spent nuclear fuel to the Naval Reactors Facility (NRF).  All lands within the Site boundaries comprise a protected outdoor laboratory where scientists from DOE, other federal and state agencies, universities, and private research foundations conduct ecological studies.

<DESC>This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R&amp;D requirement. Small Businesses are encouraged to respond.
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) continues to have a need for collecting, storing, monitoring and distributing, serum, plasma, urine and DNA for the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) Biospecimen Repository.</p>
<p>SWAN is an ongoing multi-ethnic longitudinal study conducted by seven (7) clinical field sites, a data coordinating center and a central laboratory. It is designed to characterize the physiological and psychosocial changes that occur during the menopausal transition and beyond. SWAN has an extensive base of well characterized data and a repository of biological specimens from 3,300 African American, Chinese, Caucasian, Japanese and Hispanic women with over twelve years of annual follow-up visits that describe the endocrinology of the transition and other factors relevant to midlife health and aging. The women, whose age ranged from 42 to 52 years at enrollment in 1996-97, will continue to be followed until they are 59-69 years old under an existing grant mechanism (separate from this Biorepository requirement) which expires in 2014. SWAN has the capability to link the expansive biological, medical, social, behavioral, and demographic data it has collected over sixteen years to the development of both positive and adverse health conditions in early old aged women. The major thematic areas include 1) Physical Functioning; 2) Bone/Osteoporosis; 3) Cognitive Function/ Symptoms/ Mental Health and 4) Diabetes/Cardiovascular disease. New domains for SWAN include physical performance and osteoarthritis, history of major depression, and carotid wall thickness. Frozen biospecimens from the seven (7) SWAN clinical field sites are currently housed in sixty-five (65) 80oC mechanical freezers at SeraCare Life Sciences located at 8425 Progress Drive, Frederick, Maryland. The SWAN Biorepository has accrued 1.7 million samples of serum, plasma, urine, and DNA that were meticulously collected and managed from 3,302 women from five race/ethnic groups followed annually prior to, during and after the menopausal transition. The SWAN Biorepository is an integral arm of SWAN intended to support (the collection, processing and storage of new specimens from the ongoing study), and, by disbursing specimens to investigators for analyses, facilitate and extend the SWAN core study to allow the efficient evaluation of new and untested existing hypotheses. SWAN will continue participant follow-up visits and longitudinal data collection between 2010 and 2014. As a result, it is anticipated that an additional 113,792 new serum, plasma and urine samples will be generated for the SWAN repository.</p>
<p>Since 2000, the biospecimen repository has been supported by a National Institutes of Health (NIH) research project grant mechanism (to the University of Michigan) separate from the SWAN clinical fields sites, coordinating center and central laboratory. This requirement shifts the SWAN Biorepository instrument from a grant to a contract mechanism.<br /><br />PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The purpose of the SWAN Biorepository is to provide a resource designed to receive, store, catalog, preserve and distribute specimens to qualified investigators. The SWAN Biorepository is needed to 1) support collection and storage of biological specimens from planned follow-up visits in the ongoing SWAN study; 2) provide for the continued management of the current repository specimens; 3) provide for the continued administration of the review process for applications for specimen use and management of specimen distribution; and 4) develop strategies to promote utilization of specimens. Description of Duties for the Biospecimen Repository, The Contractor shall perform the tasks specified below to support the aforementioned needs as directed by the NIA Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). The Contractor shall provide Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedures for prospective monitoring and evaluation of short and long term specimen management, including identification and removal of non-useful specimens and refinement of specimen cataloging. The Contractor shall follow all federal and State requirements and current best practices for the collection, storage, cataloguing, retrieval and distribution of biological material for scientific research. The Contractor shall also follow the SWAN Biorepository Operational Guidelines for acquiring and distributing biospecimens.</p>

<p>The specific tasks will include: (1) Project Management, the Contractor shall provide a technical and administrative infrastructure to ensure the efficient planning, initiation, implementation, and management of all performance requirements contained in the Statement of Work (SOW) and ensure effective communications with the NIA COTR and Contracting Officer. This infrastructure shall include a Principal Investigator with responsibility for 1) overall project management and communications, tracking, monitoring and reporting on project status and progress, and 2) recommending modifications to project requirements and timelines, including contract requirements performed by any subcontractor(s). This infrastructure shall also include a Project Manager to coordinate Biorepository activities conducted under this contract; and administrative staff with responsibility for financial management and financial reporting on all activities conducted by the Contractor and any subcontractor(s). The Contractor shall administer the fiscal resources of the Biorepository; manage all activities related to the negotiation, distribution, and recovery of resources, including Material Transfer Agreements (MTA) and data recovered under the MTA; manage the Biorepository and its resources in a manner consistent with ethical procedures prescribed by the Institutional Review Board, while meeting the requirements for data sharing and resource distribution, including the genetics material and data; assure that activities are consistent with best repository practices (codified by the International Society of Biological and Experimental Repositories-ISBER); and administer the application process for scientists wanting to use Repository specimens and data resources. (2) Storage Facilities and Equipment, the SWAN Biorepository specimens are currently housed at SeraCare Life Sciences in 65 freezers purchased by the University of Michigan (using government funds from a grant supporting the SWAN Repository). In order to avoid redundant freezer and relocation costs and unacceptable risk to these highly perishable and irreplaceable biological specimens, the Contractor shall provide sufficient space for freezers at SeraCare Life Sciences located at 8425 Progress Drive, Frederick, MD to store and maintain biologic specimens collected from 3,300 SWAN participants from 1996 to the present. The Contractor shall obtain services from, and manage the subcontract with, SeraCare, which will physically house, operate and maintain the SWAN Biorepository Specimen and Electronic Inventory. The Contractor and Subcontractor shall maintain high quality storage and inventory for an estimated 1.7 million specimens of plasma, serum, urine, whole blood samples, immortalized cells and extracted DNA (including 578,000 serum, plasma and urine samples collected from annual visits; 26,000 DNA samples; and one million urine samples from the Daily Hormone Study (DHS) in which participants collected urine samples daily for one entire menstrual cycle per year). An additional 113,792 specimens will be collected from SWAN participants at follow-up visits during the current project period which ends in 2014. The facilities provided shall enable expansion of the SWAN Biorepository over the period of the contract. It is estimated that an additional five (5) -80oC freezers (comparable to the profile, capacity and quality of the existing freezers) will be needed to house new samples collected between 2010 and 2014. The Contractor shall ensure that an adequate number of empty, functional storage units, are available to serve as back-up units in the event of freezer failure. (3) Data Management Systems, (A) SWAN Biorepository Website, The Contractor shall maintain and enhance the "SWAN Data Warehouse", a searchable, concept-driven website to promote understanding of the SWAN Study and its data and biospecimen resources, provide access to SWAN data and support all repository utilization functions by: Generating a content-driven MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) matrix that is linked to SWAN publications and descriptions of the nature and scope of existing SWAN data ; Providing detailed information about the data and assay methodologies and publication history to SWAN investigators, requestors of samples and the scientific community; Providing access to necessary protocols, forms, and technical assistance documentation; and Incorporating a "report-generator" function for efficient electronic building of codebooks and datasets. In addition, the website shall provide a secure point of access for authorized users of the specimen inventory and request management system. The system user manual, material transfer agreements (MTAs), and other related information shall also be made available via the website of the Biorepository. (B) Specimen Inventory System, The University of Michigan is the sole proprietor of the specific version of the inventory management system developed for the SWAN Biorepository. Therefore, there is limited access to the data management system itself. The Contractor shall use an electronic inventory system to manage the biospecimen inventory which shall include the following features: 1) biospecimen management; 2) requisition/workflow tracking; 3) freezer/inventory management; 4) comprehensive reporting; 5) shipment and discrepancy tracking; and 6) security features. The inventory system shall be customizable to meet the changing needs of the SWAN Biorepository. The Contractor shall establish systems to ensure data security and to prevent loss of inventory data in case of physical damage or equipment failure. The Contractor shall establish systems that prevent access to biospecimens and data by unauthorized individuals. The BSI Website is available to specific approved users to access specific inventory reports, query the data, submit outgoing requisitions for testing or provide incoming shipment notification. Under no circumstances are any personal identifiers of the study participants entered into this system. The Contractor shall develop a plan for recovery of stored biospecimens and data following a natural or man-made disaster. (C) System Security, the Contractor shall provide an Information Technology (IT) Security Plan compliant with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) to ensure security of all data existing or generated over the life of the contract. The Contractor must implement and maintain security requirements and backups for the computer system and other database and hard copy systems to provide security against anticipated risks including loss of specimen data, and access to records by unauthorized personnel or outside entities.

<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE. The anticipated period of performance is one 12-month base year from 6/30/2011 through 6/29/2012 with four option years thereafter.</p>
<p>OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS: (1) The government is expected to use procedures in FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiations. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code will be 621991 ($10.0 Million). (2) The Contractor shall obtain services from SeraCare Life Sciences, 8425 Progress Drive, Frederick, MD. The frozen biospecimens from the seven (7) SWAN clinical field sites are currently housed at SeraCare in sixty-five (65) 80&#8304;C mechanical freezers purchased by the University of Michigan (using government funds from a grant supporting the SWAN Repository). There are 1.7 million highly perishable and irreplaceable biological specimens (whole blood, serum, plasma, urine, extracted DNA, buccal cells, immortalized cells) contained in these freezers. Relocation of this large repository collection from SeraCare's location entails 1) significant risks of damaging the viability of cells and loss of years of progress made for the SWAN study as well as 2) redundant freezer and unnecessary relocation costs. (3) <br />The Contractor shall utilize the inventory management system developed for and used by the SWAN repository. Because the University of Michigan is the sole proprietor of this specific version, access to this data management system is limited. (3) The Contractor shall obtain required shipping licenses and permits from local, State, Federal and international authorities for the safe import, storage and distribution of biological specimens, according to current regulatory guidelines, as applicable. The Contractor shall provide proof of required licenses prior to contract award.</p>

SWAN has an extensive base of well characterized data and a repository of biological specimens from 3,300 African American, Chinese, Caucasian, Japanese and Hispanic women with over twelve years of annual follow-up visits that describe the endocrinology of the transition and other factors relevant to midlife health and aging. The women, whose age ranged from 42 to 52 years at enrollment in 1996-97, will continue to be followed until they are 59-69 years old under an existing grant mechanism (separate from this Biorepository requirement) which expires in 2014. SWAN has the capability to link the expansive biological, medical, social, behavioral, and demographic data it has collected over sixteen years to the development of both positive and adverse health conditions in early old aged women. The major thematic areas include 1) Physical Functioning; 2) Bone/Osteoporosis; 3) Cognitive Function/ Symptoms/ Mental Health and 4) Diabetes/Cardiovascular disease. New domains for SWAN include physical performance and osteoarthritis, history of major depression, and carotid wall thickness. Frozen biospecimens from the seven (7) SWAN clinical field sites are currently housed in sixty-five (65) 80oC mechanical freezers at SeraCare Life Sciences located at 8425 Progress Drive, Frederick, Maryland. The SWAN Biorepository has accrued 1.7 million samples of serum, plasma, urine, and DNA that were meticulously collected and managed from 3,302 women from five race/ethnic groups followed annually prior to, during and after the menopausal transition. The SWAN Biorepository is an integral arm of SWAN intended to support (the collection, processing and storage of new specimens from the ongoing study), and, by disbursing specimens to investigators for analyses, facilitate and extend the SWAN core study to allow the efficient evaluation of new and untested existing hypotheses. SWAN will continue participant follow-up visits and longitudinal data collection between 2010 and 2014. As a result, it is anticipated that an additional 113,792 new serum, plasma and urine samples will be generated for the SWAN repository.</p>
<p>Since 2000, the biospecimen repository has been supported by a National Institutes of Health (NIH) research project grant mechanism (to the University of Michigan) separate from the SWAN clinical fields sites, coordinating center and central laboratory. This requirement shifts the SWAN Biorepository instrument from a grant to a contract mechanism.<br /><br />PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The purpose of the SWAN Biorepository is to provide a resource designed to receive, store, catalog, preserve and distribute specimens to qualified investigators. The SWAN Biorepository is needed to 1) support collection and storage of biological specimens from planned follow-up visits in the ongoing SWAN study; 2) provide for the continued management of the current repository specimens; 3) provide for the continued administration of the review process for applications for specimen use and management of specimen distribution; and 4) develop strategies to promote utilization of specimens. Description of Duties for the Biospecimen Repository, The Contractor shall perform the tasks specified below to support the aforementioned needs as directed by the NIA Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). The Contractor shall provide Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedures for prospective monitoring and evaluation of short and long term specimen management, including identification and removal of non-useful specimens and refinement of specimen cataloging. The Contractor shall follow all federal and State requirements and current best practices for the collection, storage, cataloguing, retrieval and distribution of biological material for scientific research.

<p><strong>Job Duty Description</strong></p>
<p>Supplemental Onsite Inspections - Contractors performing this activity will provide technical assistance to the NRC staff performing inspections of nuclear facilities under construction to assure compliance with design specifications, the conditions of the construction permit or operating license, provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the NRC. Therefore, the contractor should have a thorough understanding of the applicable aforementioned rules and regulations.</p>
<p>Contractors must possess a thorough knowledge of a range of engineering disciplines, such as civil, mechanical, nuclear, and electrical engineering equivalent to that gained through the completion of a baccalaureate degree supplemented with a minimum 10 years of experience in the inspection and licensing of nuclear facility systems, with particular emphasis on quality assurance, safety and design, and construction. They must also possess a thorough knowledge of the fundamental principles of structural fabrication and construction techniques in the areas of, but not limited to, concrete, welding, electrical, instrumentation, nondestructive examination testing and evaluation practices, and codes and standards, as applicable to nuclear power reactors or fuel cycle facilities.<br />The contractor will analyze and understand potential safety hazards; evaluate specific types of facilities; and observe, review, assess, and report on construction activities, engineering, maintenance, equipment testing, radiological controls, emergency preparedness, and facility management, such as quality assurance, corrective action programs and administrative controls.</p>
<p>The contractor must have proficient skill in clearly presenting technical information (oral and written) sufficient to communicate effectively with NRC staff, licensees, and others, and to prepare inspection report input in a timely manner. The contractor assures that inspection procedures are completed in accordance with the Inspection Manual or other official documents. The NRC reserves the right to edit and disposition any findings made during an inspection by the contractor.</p>
<p>The contractor must maintain composure in stressful situations. Most of the working time is spent engaged in field inspection work, which involves exposure to plant construction conditions including open trenches, excavations, heights, construction equipment, falling objects, rotating machinery, elevated temperature, as well as inclement weather. The contractor may be subject to extensive walking, standing, climbing, bending, and lifting of moderately heavy items. He/she is required to wear protective clothing and safety devices/equipment as applicable. Administrative work is performed in a typical office environment.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the contractor will be required to report to the construction site during evening, night, or weekend hours.</p>
<p>Scheduling - Contractors performing scheduling activities will provide support to the scheduling team. He/she must be proficient with the conversion of Primavera schedules to the Microsoft Project software and the use of Microsoft Project server. The contractor will be responsible for managing the daily updates and publishing of the construction site inspection schedules. The contractors may either be assigned to a specific project/site or may support the scheduling team with generic issues for all the construction sites. The contractor will report any schedule discrepancies to the scheduling team leader. The contractor will ensure that all confirmed schedule changes are incorporated into the inspection schedule prior to the planning and scheduling meeting. The contractor will also participate in recurring planning and scheduling meetings. Upon notification of completion of an inspection task, the contractor is responsible for updating the status of the inspection task on the inspection schedule.<br /><br />Periodic interface (i.e., meetings or conference calls) with licensees/applicants will be required. The contractor may be required to travel to his/her assigned site to assist the NRC site personnel with managing the site inspection schedule and ensuring the interface with the licensee's scheduling software is functional. On-site attendance may be required on a temporary full-time basis during peak construction activity.</p>
<p>Special Testing Methods/Non-Destructive Examination/Independent Testing - Contractors performing these activities will provide assistance to NRC inspectors when specific problems arise at construction sites beyond the NRC inspectors' expertise, or when current scheduling and resource loads cannot support the specific issue. The contractors are considered supplemental support to the NRC inspector staff. The contractors will augment the available staff resources and provide expertise with competencies, accrued knowledge, and highly specialized skills in the areas listed on, but not limited to, the applicable skill set matrix attached. The contractors should be technical experts in their field, with sufficient experience and knowledge to identify, assess, and evaluate issues. The contractors should be certified or qualified technical specialists, as applicable, with extensive expertise in the technical areas. The contractors should also be technically creditable to respond to questions regarding the specific issues.</p>
<p>Preoperational and Start-up Testing Inspections - Contractors performing these activities will supplement NRC inspectors with verifying that 1) systems and components important to the safety of the plant are fully tested to demonstrate that they satisfy their design requirements, and 2) management controls and procedures, including quality assurance programs, necessary for operation of the facility have been documented and implemented. Some examples include initial calibration of instrumentation necessary to prepare a system for operation, containment integrity and hydrostatic testing of piping systems necessary to demonstrate component, system or structure design and construction adequacy, and containment leak rate tests. Similarly, the contractors will support NRC inspectors with inspection activities to verify that the licensee is meeting the requirements and conditions of the facility license for pre-critical tests, initial fuel loading, initial criticality, low-power testing, and power ascension tests. The contractor may verify through reviewing procedures and records, direct observation, witnessing tests, reviewing test data, meeting with site personnel, and evaluating test results. The contractor will provide input into the inspection reports in a timely manner. The NRC reserves the right to edit and disposition any findings made during an inspection by the contractor.</p>
<p>Contractors must possess a thorough knowledge of a range of engineering disciplines, such as civil, mechanical, nuclear, and electrical engineering equivalent to that gained through the completion of a baccalaureate degree supplemented by several years of experience in the inspection and licensing of nuclear facility systems, with particular emphasis on quality assurance, safety and design, and construction and/or operation of power reactors or fuel cycle facilities, sufficient to assist with inspections of nuclear facility preoperational and start-up testing activities. The contractor must maintain knowledge of the availability and usefulness of new or improved procedures, instruments, and equipment related to construction inspection and testing work. He/she must also be able to maintain a technical proficiency and understanding of the latest technical developments for construction testing techniques and standards.</p>
<p>Operator Licensing Examiner - Contractors will provide additional technical expertise to the NRC Regional Offices in the preparation, administration, grading, and review of written and operating tests to applicants for commercial reactor operator (RO) and senior operator (SRO) licenses for a temporary period of time. It is expected that contractors will be utilized during the licensing of ROs and SROs for the first set of plants built for a design center. Contractors will assist NRC region-based examiners in the preparation, administration, grading, and review of written and operating tests to applicants for commercial reactor operator (RO) and senior operator (SRO) licenses. Operating under the current operator licensing process, contractors will exercise minimal discretionary authority and make limited value judgments when preparing recommendations to NRC employees who decide whether to grant operator licenses. Contractors will report to the NRC Chief Examiner for the licensing in which they are participating.</p>
<p>Contractors are required to certify as an NRC operator licensing examiner. To be considered for certification, contractors shall be currently or previously licensed by the NRC as a SRO at a commercial power reactor; or significant operational experience at a military or Department of Energy reactor at a supervisory level; or previously certified by the NRC as an operator licensing examiner.</p>
<p>Contractors will prepare, administer, grade, and review written and operating tests. They will require contractor familiarization with facility-supplied procedures, lesson plans, and other training materials. Contractors will incorporate into the written exam, comments based on quality reviews. Contractors are expected to develop simulator scenarios and job performance measures as part of the operating test. Contractors will provide input to the operator licensing exam report through the Chief Examiner. Contractors will provide input into NRC licensing decisions. Contractors will not make any independent licensing decisions.</p>
<p>Design Acceptance Criteria (DAC) and Inspection, Testing, Analysis, Acceptance Criteria (ITAAC) Inspections - A special set of Instrumentation and Control (I&amp;C) skill will be needed for a temporary time period to support inspection efforts, whether they be ITAAC (including DAC) inspections or engineering design verification inspections. Specifically, I&amp;C expertise in digital technology (e.g., software development, data communications, electronic equipment qualification) will be needed to verify I&amp;C design attributes.</p>
<p>The following are specialized expertise that contractors could provide: (1) software design, coding, and testing; (2) seismic, environmental, and electromagnetic qualification testing; and (3) data communication implementation. The staff would provide general knowledge of the design, I&amp;C architecture, and regulations/guidance.</p>
<p>Contractors will review the detailed design reports, analysis, and equipment and interview licensee/vendor personnel as necessary. They will also provide input to ITAAC inspection reports pertaining to their review items. The NRC reserves the right to edit and disposition any findings made during an inspection by the contractor. Contractors cannot lead the team inspections or inspect as a single person.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), intends to establish a bridge by issuing a modification under contract number DTFACT-04-C-00004 on the basis of other than full and open competition with Global Systems Technologies (GST). The work performed under the subject contract provides DHS Transportation Security Laboratory (TSL) with critical, mission related R&amp;D support within the trace explosives and explosives simulant laboratories. The labs support TSL's core mission to enhance homeland security by performing research, development and validation of solutions to detect and mitigate the threat of explosive devices. TSL has a requirement for continuity of services, valued at $1,698,000 with a 7 month period of performance.
<p>GST is the incumbent on the subject contract and the only source that can continue supporting TSL's immediate needs with cleared (i.e. possess Secret clearance) and suitable (i.e. meet S&amp;T suitability) subject matter experts who are technically capable to perform the critical R&amp;D tasks in a timely manner. Otherwise, the Government will be without support from its primary trace explosives and explosives simulant research laboratory, pending award of the follow-on competitive RDT&amp;E and Technical Support Services acquisition.</p>
<p>This is a synopsis for information only. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement not to exceed 5 pages, which will be reviewed and considered by the Government. All capability statements shall be submitted to the Contract Specialist identified below no later than 2:00 pm ET on Friday, 9 July 2010. The Government, at its discretion, reserves the right to review any capability statements received after this date.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER DACW01-03-C-0017.  Using Recovery Act Funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number DACW01-03-C-0017, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee (CPAF) contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Walter F George Lake, ACF Rivers Project, Fort Gaines Georgia, awarded to Anderson Construction Company, 58 Crozier Lane, Fort Gaines, Georgia. Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds were previously added to the basic contract. The contractor will develop specifications and perform building rehab services including replacing lighting, doors, ceilings, siding, and replacing the roof at the ACF Rivers Project Management Office, Eufaula, Alabama, and other upgrades for energy efficiency and to reduce maintenance.<BR> The modification will also incorporate contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds.  This existing contract must be used because: 1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared. The extent of the work and the resources required can not be fully determined. 2) This contract enables work to begin immediately without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time needed for the renovations to the facility.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using Recovery Act funds, including compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation , and, to the maximum extent practicable, making fixed-price (FP) contract awards using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although Mobile District's contract was not awarded as a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside, and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing Operation and Maintenance contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing Operation and Maintenance contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles for the work anticipated under this modification.<BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>US Army Engineer District, Mobile, P.

If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered an unacceptable offer and may result in the offer being considered non responsive. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. In addition, to identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced, enter "NSP" in the unit price and/or to identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge, enter "NC" in the unit price. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal non-responsive. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges.</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.<br />(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.<br />(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.<br />(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

<p>Considering the well reported importance of monitoring the epidemics and the behavior of most at risk populations (MARPs) for HIV, the Instituto Nacional de Luta contra a SIDA (INLS) has requested assistance in conducting behavioral and serologic surveillance (BSS) in Angola with MARPs. <br />Based on the results of a qualitative assessment with most at risk populations in the provinces of Luanda and Cunene, it was recommended that BSS to be conducted with men who have sex with men (MSM) in Luanda, long distance truck drivers in both Luanda and Cunene provinces, and young women involved in transactional sex in the border region of Cunene. <br />This request for contract is to conduct a BSS among long distance truck drivers in Luanda and Cunene.<br />Although no serological data is available for truck drivers in Angola, several studies have identified them as a vulnerable population for acquiring and transmitting STI (sexually transmitted infections), including HIV, in different locations throughout the world. HIV risk in this population is driven by the mobile nature of their work, which makes them move away from protective social networks, including family and broader communities, and may result in greater exposure to risky behaviors while traveling (Lippman et al., 2007). Following Angola's civil war, the borders of neighboring countries opened, allowing greater mobility to and from neighbor countries with generalized HIV epidemics. As a result, long distance truck drivers have become an important population for acquiring and transmitting STI/HIV.</p>
<p>Project Objective <br />To assist the Government of Angola in understanding the HIV epidemic among long distance truck drivers, CDC will support a behavioral and serological surveillance (BSS) baseline survey for the targeted population.</p>
<p>The objectives of the survey are:</p>
<p>1) Examine attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions of risk related to HIV and STD among truck drivers;<br />2) Estimate HIV and syphilis prevalence among truck drivers; and <br />3) Develop capacity within the Ministry of Health to implement subsequent BSS surveys among most at risk populations for HIV.</p>
<p>This information collected will be used by program managers and planners to develop and improve HIV prevention and care programs for the target population.<br /><br />.</p>
<p>Peformance Work Statement <br />BSS will include an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire along with biological testing for syphilis and HIV.</p>

The Request For Proposal (RFP) number is TIRNO-10-R-00021

The IRS IT Program Evaluation Office Earned Value Management (PEO EVM) organization  is enhancing the Performance-Based Management System (PBMS), a suite of industry standard performance measurement tools and processes that use Earned Value Management (EVM) integrated with other best practice project management tools to provide a better view of in-flight project performance and to facilitate proactive project management and reporting.  

The PBMS will be built in stages; it has been implemented on standalone, non-networked desktop computers and will eventually migrate to a networked environment.  CADE 2 performance data will be the initial input for the beta implementation in both standalone and networked environments.  The goal for the PBMS beta is to facilitate consistent, authoritative analysis and reporting of CADE 2 performance data.  Based on the success of the beta, the PBMS concept can then be adopted for other IRS programs.

This RFP is to obtain support services for the implementation of the PBMS with respect to policy, processes, technology, and roles using Cobra 5 and  wInsight 6.4 (including wInsight Administrator, wInsight Professional, and wInsight Dashboard), and to provide on-site analysis and integration support to enhance the interoperability, reporting and management capabilities of the PBMS beta developed and available for use with the Customer Account Data Engine (CADE) 2 program in both standalone and networked environments.  

Monthly costs, schedule and performance status will be stored and accessed within the PBMS performance data repository where information can be analyzed and performance reports can be generated.  Integrated Contractor and Government cost, schedule and performance information will be made visible to management and users at the appropriate levels in a dashboard format that is Web-based and compatible with Microsoft Sharepoint 2003 or 2007.  This system will also support OMB Exhibit 300 and IT Dashboard reporting. 


The following RFP tasks include: TASK 1:  Implementation Support; TASK 2: Knowledge Transfer; and TASK 3: Reporting.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541611.

The Contract Line Item Number(s) are as follows:
(Base and Option Period 1) CLIN 0001, to include SLIN 0001AA  labor for Task 1, SLIN 0001AB  labor for Task 2, and SLIN 0001AC  labor for Task 3; CLIN 0002 is for Work Requests.

Period of Performance shall be (Base Period) August 16, 2010- August 15, 2011.

Proposals will be evaluated using the following factors: Technical Capability, Management Approach, Past Performance, Key Personnel and Price. Technical factors are more significant than Price.

Proposal(s) are due by (mail and e-mail) 3pm EST, July 15, 2010 to the address shown below:

<SUBJECT>Architect/Engineer Design Contract for Building 1 Renovation Project
<SOLNBR>SB1341-10-RP-0085
<RESPDATE>072710
<ARCHDATE>08022010

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology seeks to commission an architectural and engineering firm to maintain and modernize the legacy of Building 1 at the NIST Boulder Campus in Boulder, Colorado. This project is to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; and creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees.
<p>In this context, NIST announces an opportunity for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with NIST quality standards and requirements. The NAICS for this project is 541310. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy targets and security requirements.</p>
<p><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />Building 1 at NIST Boulder (also known as the Radio Building) was constructed in 1954. It serves as the main laboratory facility for research and measurements at NIST Boulder, supporting the NIST mission to provide measurements, standards, and technology that advance economic growth and address national needs. Building 1 comprises a total of 300,000 square feet, and includes administrative and support staff offices as well as laboratories. Building 1 includes a wide range of laboratory facilities that support research and measurements in areas such as electronics, nanotechnology, time and frequency measurements, quantum computing and quantum communications, laser science, optics, superconducting sensors, radio-frequency communications, magnetic field measurements, and many other areas. In many of these areas, NIST Boulder performs the world's best research and measurements, including the world's leading quantum computing research programs, the world's most accurate atomic clocks, and some of the world's most sensitive measurements using unique superconducting devices. Building 1 also includes two clean room facilities for the fabrication of unique nanoscale instruments that are used for NIST Boulder research and measurements. The extremely demanding and sensitive research and measurements performed in Building 1 require tight control of environmental conditions such as temperature, vibration, humidity, and air quality.</p>
<p>Environmental and space requirements for the Building 1Renovation (B1R) are based on extensive programmatic studies of NIST's technically demanding scientific programs, many of which directly or indirectly support US competitiveness. The building environmental requirements for programs slated for the B1R are not being effectively and economically met with laboratory space currently occupying a structure dedicated in 1954. Renovation of Building 1 is a necessity for NIST's continued long-term support of US industrial competitiveness in the world market. The B1R will provide extensive renovation of approximately half of Building 1, including Wings 3, 5, 6 and a portion of the Center Spine. This will provide 80,000 net assignable square feet of high performance laboratory space to perform research and measurements needed by industry and the scientific community. The B1R consists of enhanced temperature control down to +/- 0.5 degree C, humidity control to +/- 5%, continuous air flow with filtration to class 10,000, vibration control, and new service corridors to provide lab support space for utilities in addition to the pedestrian corridor.</p>
<p>Electrical elements included in the renovation will address components such as lighting, power distribution, power quality, electromagnetic interference, and standby emergency power for critical laboratory functions. The B1R will locate the bus ducts in the service corridors. Chilled water, steam, and compressed air will be supplied from the Boulder site Central Utility Plant. Communication elements that will be addressed include infrastructure components such as telephone cabling and fiber optic networks for data. Life safety and building security elements in the renovation include components such as fire alarm systems, fire sprinkler systems, and building access control. Renovation design and construction will comply with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and will be submitted for LEED certification for existing buildings.</p>
<p>The renovation will support key technology areas such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, new energy sources, computing and telecommunications in a high performance facility.</p>
<p>NIST has a need for a Lead Architect/Engineer for the Renovation of Building 1, a cast-in-place reinforced concrete building that would meet the following requirements. Provide pre-construction services to include detailed cost estimating of a $40 - $80 million construction contract for the Building 1 Renovation on a federal campus. In addition to cost estimating, the selected A/E shall provide constructability reviews, value engineering recommendations, provide design reviews at the various design submittal stages for two years. Due to the size of the project, the Architectural-Engineering (A-E) firm's contract with NIST is projected to range from $3.5 to $5 million dollars for design services to include all architecture, engineering, hazardous material/soil testing, inspections, laboratory de-commissioning standards, survey work, coordination with multiple federal, state, and local agencies and municipalities. The A-E shall have past experience in the same scale of renovation projects and provide sufficient references for successful project completions of multiple projects ranging between $30 and $60 million. The A-E shall be familiar with the use of Integrated Project Delivery through the use of Building Information Modeling which will benefit the government during the entire life cycle of the building. This experience shall include renovations of occupied space including but not limited to Domestic Water, Fire Suppression Water, Sanitary Sewer, Storm Water, High Voltage Electrical, Telecommunications, and Security. The A-E shall be familiar with hazardous material removal methods including removal and containment that meets both the Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Colorado's Department of Environmental Health Protection Division. <br />Renovated spaces shall be sufficient to support NIST's vision well into the 21st Century and will be supportive of infrastructure recently developed on site. The finished environment shall be supportive of internal collaboration and informal interaction and shall be energy efficient. The complexity of the program is evident from the numerous and diverse research divisions and support organizations located on the campus.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK<br />The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional Architecture and Engineering Services. NIST estimates that 65% of the design will fall under the engineering discipline while the remaining 35% will fall under the architectural discipline. The scope of work will require at a minimum: construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), (BIM) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a federal campus that includes the decommissioning of existing laboratories and the construction of interior and exterior upgrades, site development, client program requirements, and sustainable features. The facility will be designed in English units.</p>
<p>Summary of Project Design Requirements:<br />&bull; Develop a master plan of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems.<br />&bull; Identify required system capacities.<br />&bull; Integrate utility plan into project scope<br />&bull; Create Building 1 project scope, budget, and phasing with assistance of project stakeholders.<br />&bull; Add and integrate utility infrastructure into architectural and structural revisions to Building 1.<br />&bull; Integrate and upgrade office and research laboratory requirements into existing spaces. <br />&bull; Upgrade building elements to comply with current code requirements.</p>
<p>SELECTION PROCESS<br />This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work. A LEAD ENGINEER DESIGNER IS REQUIRED. The A/E Firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design. The Lead Engineer Designer is the individual or the team of designers who will have primary responsibility to develop the concept and the project design.</p>
<p>The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: In Stage I, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the Lead Designer and Design Firm. In Stage II, shortlisted Lead Designer-A/E Teams will be interviewed.</p>
<p>All documentation will be in an 8 &frac12;" x 11" format. The assembled content for the Stage I portfolio should be no more than 1/4 inch thick. The portfolio should include the following: a cover letter referencing the FBO announcement and briefly describing the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments. The firms will be required to complete Standard Form 330 Architect Engineer Qualifications Parts I and II that reflect the entire design team. An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of representatives NIST and their clients will evaluate the submissions.</p>
<p>Submission Requirements and Evaluation Criteria:</p>
<p>(1) SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE: The A/E Firm(s) will submit a portfolio of five (ONLY FIVE, ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WILL NOT BE REVIEWED) similarly (*) scoped projects completed by the lead firm in the last ten years (maximum of five pages per project). The narrative shall: address the design approach with salient features for each project and discuss how the client's program, function, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution; address the relevance of submitted projects to this project.</p>

<p>BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:</p>
<p>The items required by this solicitation shall be Cisco SMARTnet brand. NIST Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) requires Cisco SMARTnet brand maintenance because Cisco SMARTnet maintenance is the only hardware/software support package that is currently available for NIST Cisco devices.</p>
<p>The NIST OCIO provides a complex environment of networks, servers, and applications. The NIST OCIO requires the access to the Cisco.com knowledgebase and tools and the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) with direct access to Cisco engineers to help troubleshoot critical problems that arise due to the complex environment. Only SMARTnet maintenance customers have direct access to Cisco engineers and can escalate problems to Cisco developers. Access to the Cisco TAC is only available to Cisco SMARTnet service contract customers or those who pay a "per-incident fee". <br />In addition, the NIST OCIO requires the ability to obtain Cisco Operating System (OS) software updates for licensed feature sets for all current production devices at the NIST Gaithersburg, Maryland campus. OS software updates include bug fixes and maintenance as well as minor and major releases within a feature set. Only devices that remain under Cisco SMARTnet maintenance coverage can be updated. If the NIST OCIO does not have Cisco SMARTnet maintenance coverage, NIST would be required to pay an additional fee for all 500+ devices each time a required update was needed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the critical nature of the NIST network equipment, the NIST OCIO requires that any failed Cisco device must be replaced with a new version of the same Cisco model or a newer Cisco model. All Cisco software licenses are to end-user purchasers and are non-transferable. Only Cisco SMARTnet authorized vendors sell the required Cisco SMARTnet maintenance to enable the NIST OCIO to ensure that its Cisco licenses are maintained.</p>
<p>In order to purchase Cisco SMARTnet maintenance service, Cisco devices must be at the current revision of the software and the device must be inspected by Cisco to make sure all components and the software are approved; otherwise, additional fees may be levied by Cisco. Cisco SMARTNet is the only brand that includes this capability. Since NIST OCIO has historically acquired SMARTnet maintenance services for its vast deployment of Cisco devices, there would not be additional fees for applying for Cisco SMARTnet maintenance now nor in the future to ensure the devices are up to date with the required Cisco software revisions and inspections. If NIST OCIO were to procure any other brand of CISCO maintenance besides SMARTnet which do not offer the certification services that SMARTNet does, these fees would be implemented, adding additional costs to NIST for any future SMARTNet requirements.</p>

In addition to bilateral instruments, contracts include (but are not limited to) awards and notices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such as purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract modifications. Contracts do not include grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq.

This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent" (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor.

<p>"Jobs retained" means an estimate of those previously existing filled positions that are retained as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent" (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor.

<p>BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:</p>
<p>The items required by this solicitation shall be Cisco SMARTnet brand. NIST Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) requires Cisco SMARTnet brand maintenance because Cisco SMARTnet maintenance is the only hardware/software support package that is currently available for NIST Cisco devices.</p>
<p>The NIST OCIO provides a complex environment of networks, servers, and applications. The NIST OCIO requires the access to the Cisco.com knowledgebase and tools and the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) with direct access to Cisco engineers to help troubleshoot critical problems that arise due to the complex environment. Only SMARTnet maintenance customers have direct access to Cisco engineers and can escalate problems to Cisco developers. Access to the Cisco TAC is only available to Cisco SMARTnet service contract customers or those who pay a "per-incident fee". <br />In addition, the NIST OCIO requires the ability to obtain Cisco Operating System (OS) software updates for licensed feature sets for all current production devices at the NIST Gaithersburg, Maryland campus. OS software updates include bug fixes and maintenance as well as minor and major releases within a feature set. Only devices that remain under Cisco SMARTnet maintenance coverage can be updated. If the NIST OCIO does not have Cisco SMARTnet maintenance coverage, NIST would be required to pay an additional fee for all 500+ devices each time a required update was needed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the critical nature of the NIST network equipment, the NIST OCIO requires that any failed Cisco device must be replaced with a new version of the same Cisco model or a newer Cisco model. All Cisco software licenses are to end-user purchasers and are non-transferable. Only Cisco SMARTnet authorized vendors sell the required Cisco SMARTnet maintenance to enable the NIST OCIO to ensure that its Cisco licenses are maintained.</p>
<p>In order to purchase Cisco SMARTnet maintenance service, Cisco devices must be at the current revision of the software and the device must be inspected by Cisco to make sure all components and the software are approved; otherwise, additional fees may be levied by Cisco. Cisco SMARTNet is the only brand that includes this capability. Since NIST OCIO has historically acquired SMARTnet maintenance services for its vast deployment of Cisco devices, there would not be additional fees for applying for Cisco SMARTnet maintenance now nor in the future to ensure the devices are up to date with the required Cisco software revisions and inspections. If NIST OCIO were to procure any other brand of CISCO maintenance besides SMARTnet which do not offer the certification services that SMARTNet does, these fees would be implemented, adding additional costs to NIST for any future SMARTNet requirements.</p>

JT-TRAINING/JB
TEM APPLICATIONS SUPPORT FOR SERIAL EM
Installation support and training of SerialEM and IMOD for a total of 1 week (5 business days including travel)

1. The system must have field emission illumination, a range of accelerating voltages up to 200 kV, an in-column energy filter, a phase plate, a TV rate camera and a 2k x 2k CCD camera with TV rate readout. The microscope must also be compatible with a Gatan 4k x 4k Ultrascan 4000 CCD camera. The following are more detailed specifications.

2. Electron Optical Specifications

Accelerating Voltage. The microscope will have an accelerating voltage of 200 kV, with semi-continuous control (50V steps or smaller).

Field Emission Source. The microscope must employ a field emission gun (FEG) as its electron source with a Schottky field emitter. Beam current shall be 0.5 nA or better in a 1 nm probe (measured at FWHM).

Coherence and Instrumental Resolution. Point-to-point resolution, under cryo low dose conditions (LN2 temperature, 10  20 e/2 total dose in a half-second exposure, ~1 m defocus), at 200kV and ~60kx magnification will be demonstrated with and without phase plate by Fourier analysis of digitized film-recorded micrographs of a thin carbon film. The micrographs will be digitized and diffraction patterns calculated and rotationally averaged. Thon fringes of significant intensity should extend to 3.3  or better. The 2D transforms will be used to check that the resolution is the same in all directions.

Zernike Phase Plate. The microscope will come equipped with a Zernike phase plate located in the back focal plane of the microscopes objective lens and produce a phase shift of &#960;/2 radians for scattered electrons compared to the unscattered beam. The cryopolepiece must accommodate the phase plate holder at the back focal plane as well as an in-lens objective aperture. At least three phase plate discs will be supplied with the instrument, each consisting of 25 or more individual phase plates. The phase plate holder must hold at least three phase plate discs and include fully adjustable heating elements to maintain the phase plate at a selected temperature in the range of room temperature to 250 C in order to reduce contamination. A motorized and computer-controlled goniometer will be supplied to accept the holder and allow precision positioning of the phase plate. A turbomolecular-pumped airlock will be included for exchanging phase plate discs in and out of the column vacuum. A commercial source must exist for the phase plates, as they are a consumable item.

In-column Omega-type Energy Filter. An automated, computer-controlled in-column omega-type energy filter must be included and allow the same wide range of magnifications (50x-1,000,000x) as used in conventional transmission electron microscope mode. Distortion in the image-formation lens system must be less than 1.5% length difference of lattice vectors across the field of view of the film and 10 eV across the same plane for energy spread.

Parallel Illumination. A condenser mini-lens should be supplied that can be controlled independently of the objective lens in order to obtain parallel illumination under a wide range of conditions.

Rotation-free Imaging System. The lens system should be configured to prevent image rotation when the magnification is changed.

Free Lens Control. All optical functions of the microscope will be independently controlled, including all lenses, stigmators, and alignment coils. Once set, these conditions can be saved and recalled.

Apertures. All apertures should be motor-driven and computer-controlled.

Stage Specifications

Goniometer. The stage must be motorized and computer-controlled, with a eucentric goniometer and have at least 70 of continuous tilt, unhindered by the pole pieces or anticontaminator, when using a Gatan Model 914 cryoholder. The goniometer must be able to return to within 2 m of a stored position when recalled by the operator. The stage must have piezoelectric elements which allow an X,Y-motion of 0.4 m or more with a step size of approximately 0.04 nm that can be used for specimen micro positioning and drift compensation.

Eucentricity. Eucentricity must be achievable with all holders. When observing an in-focus object at X = Y = 0, tilting across the full tilt range (in either direction) should yield a deviation in the X and Y position of the object of less than 1.5 m during the entire operation.

Mechanical and Thermal Stability. With a cryoholder at its minimum temperature and within two minutes of the last stage movement, the drift rate, without electronic drift compensation, should be < 5 /min at 0 tilt, < 10 /min at 30 tilt, < 15 /min at 45 tilt, and < 25 /min at 70 tilt.

Vacuum System Specifications

Vacuum System. The vacuum system should be fully automatic and differentially pumped using turbo-molecular, sputter ion, and diffusion pumps.

Specimen Airlock. The specimen rod will have double o-ring seals, with the volume between the o-rings continuously pumped during airlock prepump. With a prepump of 1-3 minutes and a fully filled cryo trap, the microscope vacuum will recover to its original value within 15 seconds of specimen insertion.

Anticontaminator. A cryo box anticontaminator must be an integral part of the cryopolepiece. The anticontaminator will maintain a temperature of 185C or lower and effectively trap extraneous ice contamination. It must not diminish tilt range or resolution in any way. The ice contamination rate of a cryo specimen should be less than 5 /hour.

3. Additional Hardware and Compatibility

Specimen Holders. A Gatan Model 914 High Tilt Liquid Nitrogen Cryo Transfer Tomography Holder will be provided along with standard single- and double-tilt room temperature holders.

Cameras. The microscope must come equipped with a high resolution CCD/TV camera for routine viewing and a 2k x 2k CCD camera with TV readout speed (30fps or more at 4x binning or less) suitable for focusing and stigmation adjustments. Furthermore, the microscope must be compatible with a Gatan 4k x 4k Ultrascan 4000 CCD camera.

4. Software

Software will be supplied for the general operation, control, and use of the microscope. Additionally, software for cryo-electron tomography as well as cryo-electron microscopy applications will be provided. At minimum, this should include a low-dose mode (which employs electromagnetic beam/image shifting to provide search, focus/tracking, and exposure modes along with appropriate beam blanking) and automated tilt-series acquisition software (such as SerialEM). As they become available, the vendor will supply free revisions and upgrades to their software products, core control software, and plug-ins required to operate the instrument. This will include existing and future software related to the phase plate and tomography.

5. Measurement of Electron Dose

The electron dose must be calibrated with a Faraday cup or equivalent method between doses of 0.01 and 120 electrons/2, and be read on a display or determined from counts per pixel on the CCD cameras, or other electron dose measurement capabilities equivalent in accuracy and convenience must be provided.

6. Uptime

Microscope uptime should be 95% or greater and guaranteed by the vendor.

ROOM SIZE CRITERIA:
The microscope and related equipment (excepting the water chiller, air compressor, and UPS unit) must be installed in a 176 x 178 room with a ceiling height of 143" and a door width of 47".

The storeroom procures various supplies, sells them to the customers, and then bills the customers for the purchases. The current storeroom system is a DOS-based Foxpro system that was created in 1987. Over the years, the Windows environment has become hostile to the storeroom system. Each Windows upgrade became increasingly less tolerant of the software. This causes frequent system crashes. Outages have lasted as long as two weeks and have required a significant amount of labor by the systems specialist to recover the data. Chief Information Officer (CIO) has informed us that the upcoming conversion to Windows 7 is expected in October and that Windows 7 will not support the Storeroom's DOS system. Support will cease on December 31, 2010 and the storeroom software must be off of the network by that same date.</p>
<p>NEEDS: A new software system is needed to replace the current Foxpro system. The system must provide inventory management, point-of-sales, management reports, and online ordering by clients. The vendor shall also provide 24/7 help desk (for a monthly fee). This requirement includes the purchase of twelve month agreement for the service and help desk support. The period of performance required is September 1, 2010 through August 31, 2011. The desired target date is to begin transferring the existing databases on or about September 1, 2010; then running the new system in parallel with the old system beginning on or about September 1, 2010. Final switchover to the new system is anticipated to be on October 1, 2010.</p>
<p>1. The software must provide the capability to manage an inventory of 7,000 line items and 3,000 customers. The system must provide the capability able to add, delete, and edit the individual records. Inventory management needs include inventory control, stock ordering, and the ability to set acquisition and sales prices.<br />2. The system must also have a strong point of sales function. The system must coordinate customer information, line item information, and billing information to process the sale of an item to a customer.<br />3. The system must be able to bill customer by generating an output billing file that will communicate with the Commerce Business System.<br />4. The system must be able to provide management reports for inventory control, inventory purchasing, daily and weekly billing reports, and customer reports.<br />5. The system must be hosted off-site, but operate in real-time.<br />6. The system must have capability to provide customers an online catalog and the ability for customers to purchase items online.<br />7. The vendor shall provide initial and follow-on training for storeroom employees during installation and fielding of the system.<br />8. Vendor shall provide system documentation and a user's manual.<br />9. The system will require Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A).</p>

<p>COMDTINST 4200.14A - Notice for Filing Agency Protests<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

This requirement will be satisfied using commercial acquisition procedures specified in FAR Parts 12 and 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; firm-fixed-price proposals for overhaul of the following items are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-10-Q-300051 is being assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only and this synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). When soliciting quotes or offers, round-off prices to the nearest U.S. dollar value. The procurement is being issued as a total small business set-aside. Evaluation factors for award will be based on Lowest Price Technically Acceptable quote. <br />The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 336413 and the size standard is 1000 employees.
<p>ELECTRICAL MECHANICAL ACTUATORS, NSN: 1680-00-073-8204, P/N: 880T100, the quantity of 13 each (Mfg cage code (98889) to be overhauled in accordance with (IAW) AFTO 8D1-9-49-3, 4.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard does not maintain nor release Air Force Technical Orders. This material has been designated as Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS) Tracked. The contractor must have access to all applicable technical orders and is responsible for obtaining the technical orders. The contractor shall review all manufacturers' service bulletins, service information letters, equipment revisions, and latest versions of (list overhaul/repair directive), for applicability against the reworked item's part number. Please provide the cover sheet/title page for the latest revision of the overhaul directive in your possession to the Contracting Officer with your offer. Contract award for this requirement will not be delayed pending contractor registration or awaiting delivery of the overhaul directive. Overhaul pricing shall include all replacement parts. All replacement parts shall be new, Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) approved parts. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) will not provide Government Furnished Material for this requirement. Drawings or specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the government. As a minimum, the offeror (that is, the prime contractor) must possess a current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification or OEM certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with its proposal/quote. Evidence of other certifications, such as a Department of Defense (DOD) Certification, may be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. Subcontracting, as it pertains to repair or overhaul of the specified components, is limited to concerns in full possession of the required certifications and must be identified with the offer. Offerors are required to propose firm-fixed price for scrapping repairable which are determined "Beyond Economical Repair". Firm-fixed prices do not include components received that indicate obvious misuse, cannibalization, or severe damage due to mishandling or crash damage. Components received in the above listed conditions will be handled on a case by case basis, after notification to the Contracting Officer of such condition. Within fifteen days of the determination, the Contractor shall submit a condition report for unusually damaged items listing parts and labor required to accomplish the "over and above work". The contractor shall be entitled to the firm-fixed-price specified in the contract for overhaul and any amounts proposed for "over and aboves" will be negotiated separately. High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the overhaul directive will NOT be considered as reasons for "over and above" proposals and will not necessitate re-negotiation of the overhaul prices. Non-reworkable items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose. Should any of the repairable be determined "Beyond Economical Repair", the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions. The Contractor will be entitled to the flat scrap rate charge specified in the award document. Offerors' proposals are to include a delivery schedule. Delivery is required no later than 45 days after receipt of material. Accordingly, the contractor will be required to notify the Contracting Officer upon receipt of the repairable. Earlier deliveries are acceptable and desired at no additional cost to the Coast Guard. The USCG, Aviation Logistics Center engineering department will make a determination on the acceptability of the DOD certification.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><strong>Only offers meeting the listed technical capability criteria are eligible for award.</strong></p>

The criteria in this section are pass/fail criteria. Only offerors meeting all of these criteria will be considered for contract award.<br /><br />1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">FAA Certification:<br /></span>The contractor shall provide verification that they possess a valid and current FAA certification applicable to the services being requested.<br /><br />2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">OEM Procedures:</span><br />The contractor shall provide verification that they have access to OEM specifications, procedures, and parts.<br /><br />3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Certificate of Conformity:</span><br />The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance in accordance with <br />FAR Clause 52.246-15 and in the format specified in the clause.<br /><br /><strong>The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer.</strong></p>

Any company found not acceptable will not be considered for award.<br /><br />Evaluation of vendor's technical capability shall include evaluation by the USCG New Product Development Branch. The evaluation will include in-depth analysis of the vendor's capability to complete the work being solicited to include: facilities, personnel, and associated processes (Quality Control, inventory management, etc.). This evaluation may be accomplished via document reviews and/or a vendor site visit.</p>

Evaluation will be conducted and completed prior to contract award.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evaluation Criteria:<br /></span></strong><br />Only offerors successfully meeting these technical evaluation factors listed above will be considered for possible award and evaluated in the following areas. The Government will evaluate quotes based on the following criteria in descending order of importance:<br /><br /><strong>1. Delivery<br />2. Past Performance (Relevant and recent)<br />3. Price<br /></strong><br />Delivery is the most important evaluation factor, with Past Performance being the second most important evaluation factor. Delivery and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than price. The closer the offers are to equality, price becomes the most important. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Delivery:<br /></span></strong><br />The offer must include delivery information IAW the attached Statement of Work. Offerors that can meet the government's required delivery date will be rated higher, with offerors that can meet or excced the government's desired delivery date rated the highest.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Past Performance:<br /></span></strong><br />The offeror shall provide three (3) past performance references that reflect relevant experience performed within the past five (5) years. Relevant experience includes that which is similar in services provided.

Offerors may provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions.</p>
<p>Past performance will be evaluated for relevancy and recency. More relevant past performance will be rated higher with more recent, relevant past performance rated the highest.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be given a neutral past performance rating. The Government may also use other information available from Government sources to evaluate an offeror's past performance. The Government reserves the right to limit or expand the number of references it decides to contact and to contact references other than those provided by the offeror.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Price:<br /></span></strong><br />The contractor shall provide pricing based on the repair/overhaul of the items documented in the solicitation <strong>HSCG38-10-Q-200153</strong>. Any quantity price discounts and discounts for prompt payment should be included in this section.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data. (Oct 1997) Alternate IV (Oct 1997).</p>
<p>(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required.</p>

Provide a copy or describe current discount policies and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale, original equipment manufacturer, or reseller. Also explain the basis of each offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price, including how the proposed price relates to the price of recent sales in quantities similar to the proposed quantities.<br />(End of provision) <br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br /><br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency. Companies must have valid DUNS numbers and be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Closing date and time for receipt of offers is&nbsp;26 JULY 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Technical Capability, which consists of demonstrated capability and experience to provide the services required by the Specifications and Drawings.</p>
<p>2. Past Performance: In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and the following, the offeror is required to identify past or current contracts for efforts similar to this requirement. Offerors shall provide the information shown below for at least three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts for the same or similar items, specifically, carpet renewal on a ship and renewal of interior polymeric deck covering systems (MIL-PRF-24613, Type III, Epoxy) on a ship, either currently being performed or completed in within three years prior to the date of this synopsis/solicitation. Provide as a minimum the following applicable information for each contract:</p>
<p>a. Contract number, Names of contracting parties or agency, point of contact, specifically the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), including email address and telephone number of these identified individuals.<br />b. Ship name, hull type, length, and displacement.<br />c. Type of availability (dry dock, dockside, etc.) and where performed;<br />d. Original contract commencement and completion dates, actual commencement and completion dates, and explanation of (i.e. reasons for) schedule slippage/extensions, if any;<br />e. Award price and final contract price (award plus growth), including the total number of growth work changes and scope of these changes. <br /><br />Past Performance will look at relevant experience, responsiveness, resources, quality and consistency of services, customer satisfaction, and management.</p>
<p>(3) Proposal Risk Assessment: In addition to the above evaluation factors, the Government will perform a proposal risk assessment of each proposal at the Technical Capability sub-factor level. This risk assessment will evaluate the degree to which the proposed method of performance has potential impact upon:</p>
<p>This risk assessment will aid the Source Selection official in making the best value determination.</p>
<p><br />4. Price: The total price will be the evaluated price.<br /><br />Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. <br />(a) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />EVALUATION APPROACH</p>
<p>1. An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>2. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals so deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the purpose of this solicitation technical capability and past performance are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit proposals that will be considered by the agency. Proposals should be written AND NOT EXCEED TEN (10) PAGES and submitted in a legible format. Proposals must fully address all Technical Capabilities Factors and Past Performance. No reference to Price shall be included in the Proposal. Proposals must contain the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.

<p>OMBUDSMAN NOTICE</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to clarify information that was answered for recently asked questions.<br /><br />1. On the LAN between Nellis and Creech, how much bandwidth is being<br />allocated to this service? <br />Currently they are saying 100MB but this can be adjusted, also there is a<br />10 GB sonnet network that has plenty of bandwidth that is available if you have an interface.</p>
<p>2. Is the Commander's Channel to be a dedicated or a shared channel on the<br />network? Do you have a preference?<br /><br />Preferably dedicated if utilized.</p>
<p>3. Can you provide any information about the LAN routers/switches that we<br />will interface with to feed the network with the programming? <br />All routers and switches are CISCO</p>
<p>1. Are there two separate LANs, one on each AFB? Or are the two connected?<br />If connected, how are they connected? If they're not connected, what's the<br />distance between the two bases? <br />Both networks are connected. There is Fiber between Nellis AFB and Creech AFB. We are currently leasing 1GB, 100MB is currently available for IPTV. This can be increased some if<br />necessary. There is also a 10GB sonnet network that has at least 1GB available if your systems can interface with it.</p>
<p>2. Regarding the Video On-Demand requirement, how long do you want to store<br />the programming? It appears that this is really for time delay purposes so<br />I assume each channel would be stored for 24 hours and then replaced. Can<br />you provide any additional details? <br />The Video On-Demand is for the selection of watching streaming video source. As far as storing content, this should be minimal.</p>

The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, IAW FAR Part 19 the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.<br /><br />(b) Submission of quotations. Submit quotations to the office specified in this solicitation on or before the date specified in this solicitation. Quotations may be submitted on letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show --<br /><br />(1) The solicitation number;<br /><br />(2) The date specified in the solicitation for receipt of quotations;<br /><br />(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the vendor;<br /><br />(4) A technical description of the items being quoted in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;<br /><br />(5) Terms of any express warranty;<br /><br />(6) Price and any discount terms;<br /><br />(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;<br /><br />(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);<br /><br />(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;<br /><br />(10) Include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Vendors that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.<br /><br />(c) Period for validity of quotations. The vendor agrees to establish a firm timeframe in which the proposed price is good for.<br /><br />(d) Reserved<br /><br />(e) Multiple quotations. Vendors are encouraged to submit multiple quotations presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each quotation submitted will be evaluated separately.<br /><br />(f) Reserved<br /><br />(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate quotations as described in FAR 13.106-2. Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government may accept other than the lowest quote; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotes received.<br /><br />(h) Reserved<br /><br />(i) Reserved<br /><br />(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all quotations exceeding $3,000, and quotations of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The vendor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its quotation, the annotation ``DUNS'' or ``DUNS +4'' followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the vendor's name and address. The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the vendor to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. A vendor within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. A vendor located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The vendor should indicate that it is a vendor for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.<br /><br />(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of a quotation, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the vendor does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered vendor. Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.<br /><br />(l) Reserved<br /><br />(End of Provision)<br /><br /><strong>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations</strong><br /><br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br /><br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br /><br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

<DESC><p>AMENDMENT - <br />REVISED SOW AND FDA'S RESPONSES TO VENDOR QUESTIONS ARE ATTACHED.<br /><br />(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial&nbsp;services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br /><br />(ii) The solicitation number is FDA-SOL-10-1068201-02.</p>
<p>(iii) This solicitation and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40. (iv) This requirement is being issued as a total small business set-aside. The NAICS code is 541519 and the small business size standard is $25M. The Government intends to issue a time and material / Labor Hour Contract for a base plus two option years. The Government reserves the right to issue an award without discussions.</p>
<p>(v) &amp; (vi): GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) is seeking qualified sources capable of Internet Monitoring and Analysis Support Services (IMSS). Please see the attached Statement of Work (SOW) and Other Terms and Conditions document for more details on this requirement (Attachment 1).</p>
<p>(viii) The provision at FAR 52.212-1 titled, "Instructions to Offerors -Commercial" (JUN 2008), applies to this acquisition and is available at website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/far2afmcfars/fardfars/far/12.htm#P257_45709. Offerors are required to submit their proposals in three separate volumes as follows:</p>
<p>Volume 1 - Technical</p>
<p>Shall include supporting documentation as attachments to the technical volume, such as resumes, project management plan, Conflict of Interest Plan, and certifications. This volume shall contain the Technical Approach and not be a reiteration of the SOW. This portion of the proposal shall exclude any reference to the pricing aspects of each offer. Offerors shall demonstrate in sufficient detail a technical approach that will meet the requirements specified in the SOW (attachment #1). The technical volume shall not exceed 25 pages and be submitted electronically in PDF format. The page limitation does not include Cover page, Table of Contents, Resumes, Certifications, Project Management plan, or Conflict of Interest Plan.</p>
<p>Volume 2- Past Performance</p>
<p>This volume shall describe the Offeror's success in performing comparable contracts/orders. The Past Performance Volume shall be no more than three pages, i.e., no more than one page narrative per contract/order and submitted electronically in PDF format. The Offeror shall submit directly to the Government:</p>
<p>A list of three contracts/orders, similar in scope, duration, and price to the work described in the SOW. The Offeror shall adhere to the following guidelines in generating this list:</p>
<p>o Contracts or orders must have been completed within three years of the quote due date. <br />o The list may include contracts/orders on which the Offeror served as a subcontractor, provided that the subcontract was similar in scope, duration, and price to this effort.<br />o The list should include both a contractual and technical point of contact (email addresses and phone numbers) for each of the contracts/orders. <br />o If a subcontract is being used as a past performance reference, contact information for the prime contractor, not the customer, should be included. <br />o The list should include the contract/order number, title (if appropriate), the period of performance, and the dollar value of the contract/order. <br />o If the contract/order is not described in the Technical Volume, the Offeror shall include a one page narrative the contract/order, describing the nature of the work performed and emphasizing outcomes reached.</p>
<p>The Offeror should also send the Past Performance Questionnaire attached to the RFP (Attachment 2) to the sources that it identifies in the Past Performance Volume. The questionnaires should be sent to the individual most knowledgeable about the Offeror's performance on the identified order or program (e.g. the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative; the Program/Project Manager; or the Contracting Officer). Each reference must complete the questionnaire and mail a hard copy to the Contract Specialist. The Offeror may opt to allow the return of completed questionnaires to the Government via electronic mail. This is solely at the discretion of the Offeror, with the understanding that e-mail systems, servers, Internet, intranets and extranets are not considered secure. The Offeror shall ensure that all the point of contacts complete and return the questionnaires to the Government prior to the RFP close date. Offerors are cautioned that the Government may use data provided by each Offeror as well as data obtained from possible other sources such as the Nation Institute of Health's (NIH) Contractor Performance System (CPS) or the Department of Defense's (DOD) Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRs) in the evaluation of past performance.<br />Government:</p>
<p>Volume 3 - Pricing Proposal</p>
<p>The completion and submission of the above items will constitute an offer (proposal) and will indicate the offeror's unconditional assent to the terms and conditions of this RFP and any attachments hereto. Alternate proposals are not authorized. Objections to any terms and conditions of the RFP will constitute deficiency, which may render the offer unacceptable. This volume shall include proposed labor categories, labor rates (fully-loaded), level-of-effort, and materials / Other Direct Costs / and Travel (if applicable) for a base plus 2 option periods. The pricing proposal shall be submitted on the attached Microsoft Excel Sheet (Attachment 3) with the cells unlocked.</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, titled, "Evaluation of Commercial Items" (JAN 1999), is applicable to this acquisition. The following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals and are listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>VOLUME 1 Technical Proposal</p>
<p>FACTOR 1) Technical Understanding: The proposed content will be evaluated on the ability to demonstrate that the offeror understands the technical requirements and has a coherent, feasible and efficient approach to providing the services required.</p>
<p>The proposal shall:</p>
<p>a) demonstrate the ability to meet the requirements as stated in the SOW; <br />b) specify the contractor's current infrastructure for internet monitoring and analysis support services to include any (if applicable) Commercial Off the Shelf (COTs), Government off the Shelf (GOTs), or contractor proprietary software; <br />c) present an approach to monitoring FDA Regulated Products and tracking affiliated networks; <br />d) presents an approach to reporting and notifying the FDA; <br />e) delineate a detailed and well organized project plan and staffing plan that demonstrates all aspects of the services to be performed</p>
<p>FACTOR 2) Relevant Experience</p>
<p>This section of the technical proposal shall include a written narrative describing two to four projects that are similar to this effort in terms of scope, complexity, importance to the agency's mission, and size. The proposed projects that are included in the narrative should involve internet monitoring. Projects listed may include contracts with the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments, and commercial customers. The narrative shall emphasize any situations in which the Offeror conducted internet monitoring, tracked affiliated networks, and monitored regulated products, such as pharmaceuticals, bilogics, vaccines, medical devices etc...</p>
<p>The technical proposals will be graded subjectively with final scores of, "Minimally Acceptable", "Acceptable", or "Exceptional". A score of "Minimally Acceptable" would mean that the proposed technical apprach minimally met the requirements and demonstrated to be difficult to implement. A score of "Acceptable" would mean that the proposed technical approach fully met the requirements and demonstrated its ability to be implemented. A score of "Exceptional" would mean that the proposed technical approach exceeded the requirements and would be easy to implement.</p>
<p>VOLUME 2: PAST PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>Past Performance: The FDA will evaluate past performance as a risk assessment; not as a weighted technical evaluation factor.</p>
<p>The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offer. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that bidder's record of past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information. When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the bidder as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance. The lack of a past performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offer.</p>
<p>VOLUME 3: PRICE</p>
<p>Price</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate proposed prices for a 12 month base period plus two 12 month option periods. Price is less important than technical and past performance. As proposals are rated more equal technically pricing will prevail. The FDA will evaluate the proposed labor rates and bottom-line price by making a price reasonableness determination. FDA will determine price reasonableness by utilizing one or several of the following price realism techniques: reviewing the proposed ceiling amount and labor rates against amounts and rates previously paid by the FDA for similar work, amounts previously charged by the contractor for similar work, standard market labor rates for similar labor categories, and determining whether the overall proposed level of effort / labor mix reflects the contractor's proposed technical approach and meets the requirements set forth in the Statement of Work. If applicable FDA reserves the right to review the contractor's labor rates on the General Service Administration (GSA) (if applicable) website and seek price information from other commercial and Government sources. Unrealistically low proposed prices (initially or subsequently) may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror either doesn't understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic quote.</p>
<p>FAR Provision 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (JUL1990) applies to this procurement. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(x) Vendors shall complete FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (FEB 2009). This can be done electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov. The contracting officer will review the vendor's online certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov to ensure that they are accurate and complete. If the vendor does not have active representations and certifications registered online they will be disqualified from being considered for award.</p>
<p>ELECTRONIC AND TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBILITY Section 508 Standards This contract qualifies for an exception to Section 508. As such, Section 508 standards requirements will not apply. (xi) The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (MAR 2009), applies to this acquisition. (xii) The clause FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (APR 2010), applies to this acquisition (See clauses in attachment #1)</p>
<p>(xvi &amp; xvii) All questions must be submitted in writing to Jody.O'Kash@fda.hhs.gov no later than Wednesday June 9, 2010. Answers to all questions will be posted as an amendment to the solicitation prior to proposal due date. Proposals must be submitted electronically to Jody.O'Kash@fda.hhs.gov no later than Thursday, July 1, 2010 at 2pm ET.</p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE: Sites must be reviewed prior to closing; however, the sponsors can be reviewed through the end of September.</p>
<p>We are interested in which sponsors and sites a vendor can review and a total cost for the review (all inclusive). An hourly rate is not a good indicator because the number of hours per visit is undetermined. In the evaluation process, we will look at which sponsor/sites can be reviewed and the total cost proposed to review the sponsor/sites.</p>
<p>Many summer programs begin when school ends which is usually in June but the majority run through the month of August. Some sites begin operations in July and may only be open for a few weeks but vendors will be able to choice among sites to visit since each site has different operating days.</p>
<p>We will send a list of operational dates for each site once the award is made.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *********************************************<br /><br />The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is soliciting proposals from medical libraries for the purpose of establishing and managing a variety of health information services at a regional level in accordance with Public Law 89-291, the Medical Library Assistance Act of 1965 and its latest extension. Public Law 89-291 and its amendments limit participation in the Nation Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) program via the contract mechanism to existing public and private non-profit medical libraries (or parent institutions of medical libraries) so as to enable each of them to serve as the Regional Medical Library (RML) for the geographic area in which it is located. The mission of the NN/LM program is to advance the progress of medicine and improve the public health by 1) providing equal access to biomedical information to all U.S. health professionals and 2) improving the public's access to health information. The program is coordinated by the National Library of Medicine, and carried out through a nation-wide network of health science libraries and information centers. Awards under this NN/LM program will be made in eight regions. The RML for Region 1 must be located in and provide service to the states of Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The RML for Region 2 must be located in and provide service to the states of Alabama, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The RML for Region 3 must be located in and provide service to the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. The RML for Region 4 must be located in and provide service to the states of Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Utah, and Wyoming. The RML for Region 5 must be located in and provide service to the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. The RML for Region 6 must be located in and provide service to the states of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington. The RML for Region 7 must be located in and provide service to the states of Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, and U.S. Territories in the Pacific Basin. The RML for Region 8 must be located in and provide service to the states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont.</p>
<p>Each RML must possess a strong collection of health science literature, must be able to exercise strong leadership in developing and coordinating activities with other libraries in the region, and must have a strong commitment to providing outreach services to health professionals and to the public. It is anticipated that eight (8) awards will be made under this solicitation (one award per Region). The awards are anticipated to be cost-reimbursement type contracts with a total performance period of five (5) years.</p>

<DESC>The Census Bureau serves as the leading source of quality data about the nation's people and economy. We honor privacy, protect confidentiality, share our expertise globally, and conduct our work openly. We are guided on this mission by our strong and capable workforce, our readiness to innovate, and our abiding commitment to our customers.<br />As part of the process for producing quality data, The Census Bureau would like to enhance the value of the housing data produced from current surveys by obtaining foreclosure records for homes experiencing "mortgage distress" and appending this information to already existing surveys to understand better the characteristics of housing unit and the household members (in the case of occupied units). Providing this information would fill an important gap in knowledge that would help guide developing policy toward housing and housing finance.
<p>In Accordance with FAR Part 13(Simplified Acquisitions Procedures), The&nbsp;Bureau of the Census&nbsp;needs to procure a complete existing National Dataset for the year 2009&nbsp;of all housing units that experienced some form of "mortgage distress". Housing units are considered to experience "mortgage distress" should one or more of the following events occur: <br />1. Receive a notice of default<br />2. Receive a notice of trustee sale, or <br />3. They become real-estate owned (REO - bank owned).<br /><br />If a particular housing unit experienced several different stages of mortgage distress in 2009 (and, thus, appears several times in the file), only the most recent stage reported is requested for the proposed foreclosure dataset. <br />Data Requirements<br />At a minimum, each record shall contain the following information:<br />a. Address of affected property<br />i. Street Address<br />ii. Apartment number (if a condo unit)<br />iii. City<br />iv. State<br />v. Zipcode<br />b. Name of borrower<br />c. Date of last action taken<br />d. Status of last action taken ( notice of default, notice of trustee sale, REO)<br />e. Property type (single family, condo, coop)<br />f. Loan amount<br />g. Date action recorded<br />h. Data action entered<br />i. Auction date - if applicable<br />j. Information about the housing unit<br />i. Number of bedrooms<br />ii. Number of bathrooms<br />iii. Square footage of house<br />iv. Number of stories<br />v. Year built<br /><br /><br />Retention: <br />The Census Bureau will retain ownership of the records.<br /><br />Deliverables and Milestone Schedule</p>
<p>Conduct post award telephone conference Within one week after award<br />Receive revised requirements (if necessary) Within one week after award</p>
<p>Receive foreclosure dataset One month after award</p>
<p>Two soft copies of the deliverable on a medium mutually acceptable to the Offeror and the Census Bureau shall be delivered or available via FTP downloand to the Census Bureau on the indicated date. The deliverables will be forwarded or made available via FTP download to the Assistant Division Chief for Housing Characteristics.</p>
<p>Travel Requirements</p>
<p>There are no travel requirements for this project.</p>
<p>Relevant Experience Required<br />The Offeror shall have an existing dataset of foreclosure records that will enable the Offeror to provide the Census Bureau with the necessary data fields for each foreclosure record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Quotations must be submitted to Pamela Miller via email at <a href="mailto:pamela.a.miller@census.gov">pamela.a.miller@census.gov</a>.&nbsp; No phone calls will be honored.</p>

A responsible offeror must demonstrate (i) adequate financial resources (e.g. copy of current trade register [Handelsregisterauszug]), (ii) compliance with the terms and conditions of the solicitation and proposed performance schedule, (iii) satisfactory past performance, (iv) satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics, and (v) must be CCR (Central Contractor Registration) registered.

<p>The government may make a single award or multiple awards. The decision to make a single award or multiple awards will be based on the assumption for the purpose of evaluating proposals, that $ 3,600 per year would be the administrative cost to the Government for issuing and administering each contract awarded under this solicitation, and individual awards will be for the items or combination of items that result in the lowest aggregate cost to the Government, including the assumed administrative costs.</p>
<p>K. Closing Date for Receipt of Proposals. Proposals shall be submitted electronically by email or FAX no later than 14 July 2010, 16:00 hours local time to one of the following email addresses: Gabriele.Binder@ramstein.af.mil and Uschi.Hoermann@ramstein.af.mil or FAX Number 049-631-536-8410. Late submission will be handled as follows:</p>
<p>1. Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in paragraph K above.</p>
<p>2. (a) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 16:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(3) If this solicitation is a request for proposal, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(b) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>3. Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>4. If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>5. Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. As the solicitation authorizes electronical offers or facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn electronically or via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>L. Any questions/inquiries regarding the solicitation shall be submitted via email to Gabriele.Binder@ramstein.af.mil and Uschi.Hoermann@ramstein.af.mil or FAX Number 049-631-536-8410 no later than 10 days after the solicitation release to properly respond prior to the closing date for receipt of proposals.</p>

Services shall be procured pursuant to the regulatory direction of FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.</p>
<p>The closing date and time for submission of offers shall be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation package, including the Standard Form 1449 and continuation pages, the Statement of Work and the Department of Labor Wage Determination, shall be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Requests for copies of the solicitation package, or any cumulative parts thereof, by any other means shall not be honored. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website for the release of the solicitation package, which should be on or about 29 June 2010 for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package and for downloading their own copy of each associative amendment, if any.</p>
<p>All firms wishing to submit a quote subsequent to the solicitation described herein MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as well as the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) database or risk their otherwise-timely quote being considered non-responsive regardless of its completeness, timeliness or other salient considerations.

The solicitation subsequent to this announcement may be cancelled. After solicitation and prior to award the possibility exists to reject all offers when cancellation is clearly in the public interest.

<p>Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101 (10 AUG 2005) the following applies:</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of quotes, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, email: Michael.jackson@scott.af.mil.

<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101 (10 AUG 2005) the following applies:</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of quotes, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, email: Michael.jackson@scott.af.mil.

<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has a requirement for the management and operation of a correctional facility to house a population of approximately 3,000 low security adult male inmates that are primarily criminal aliens with one year or less remaining to serve on their sentence. This population is currently housed in various IGAs and MOUs throughout the Southwestern United States, concentrated primarily in Texas. The funding for this project will come from current budgeted funds expended for housing and medical care of these STS inmates in the existing IGAs and MOUs. This requirement may be fulfilled through a single award or multiple awards resulting from this solicitation. The solicitation may result in an award or awards up to approximately 3,000 beds. The BOP anticipates that each facility or complex of facilities will house a minimum of 900 beds to a maximum of 3,000 beds. The inmates shall be housed in a secure correctional institution or institutions located in the Southwestern United States. The facility(ies) must be located in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, or Arizona.
<p>Proposed institutions shall meet BOP standards as set forth in the resulting solicitation/contract. Effective at the date of NTP, offerors are prohibited from housing non-BOP inmates within the same fence perimeter; however, multiple populations at a prison complex with separate fence lines is acceptable. Shared services within each fence line is not acceptable.</p>
<p>An offeror awarded a contract must be ready to accept inmates at an existing facility within 120 days after contract award at the rate specified in the resulting contract. An existing facility is defined as an institution ready to accept inmates, or for which construction expansion began, prior to the date of this notice. Expansion of a facility or new construction of a facility initiated after the date of this notice is prohibited.</p>
<p>Potential offerors must submit all potential places of performance to be proposed to the Contracting Officer by 06/11/2010. In addition, offerors must submit a digital aerial photo of the proposed facility with their completed Intent to Propose response.</p>
<p>The BOP intends to award a firm-fixed price, Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity type contract. The Government will be required to order and the contractor required to furnish at least the established minimum quantity of 90% of the accepted number of contract beds for each contract year. Additionally, the contractor will be required to house a daily population of up to 15% over the accepted number of contract beds for each contract year. The contract award(s) will have a potential term of 10 years, consisting of one four-year base period and six one-year option periods. Contract performance will be governed by a Performance Work Statement based on the American Correctional Association/Standards for Adult Local Detention Facilities.</p>
<p>Award selection shall be made on a best value basis for the Government. The non-price evaluation factors, when conbined, are significantly less important than price. The BOP has established a decisional rule criterion requiring all offerors to clearly demonstrate they have verifiable corporate experience operating a secure correctional/detention institution for a continuous three-year period as of the date the Request for Proposals (RFP) is issued. Information will be required from offerors regarding both existing and anticipated environmental impacts and the environmental condition of the proposed site where the institution is located. Environmental documentation and other related information will be required with the submission of the proposal in order to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). A NEPA analysis will be performed for each proposed contract action. The BOP anticipates that NEPA will be satisfied through the preparation of an Environmental Assessment prior to contract award.</p>
<p>This requirement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis, open to both large and small businesses. Faith Based and Community Organizations can submit offers equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the BOP.</p>
<p>The solicitation&nbsp;posting date is&nbsp;05/21/2010, with&nbsp;the closing date for receipt of proposals on 07/20/2010. The solicitation will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunity website http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The site provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. All contractors doing business with the Federal Government shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The website for CCR is www.ccr.gov. The North American Industry Classification System code for this solicitation is 561210, Facilities Support Services. Interested parties requiring further information should email Sarah Ellis, Contract Specialist, at sellis@bop.gov or Ryan Wynne, Contract Specialist at rwynne@bop.gov.</p>

<DESC>THIS CONTRACTING ACTION IS BEING OFFERED UNDER THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND RE-INVESTMENT ACT (ARRA). The Forest Service has a requirement for crushing and stockpiling gravel from the Big Creek gravel pit. The source of the material to be crushed is a Government-owned pit on the National Forest System land. This pit has been used before to produce crushed aggregate for road surfacing. The Quality control of all work performed to provide the end product is the Offeror's responsibility. The Government will inspect the work periodically to ensure quality is being met. Project Location: The Big Creek Gravel Pit is located on the Superior Ranger District, Lolo National Forest, Mineral County, Montana, on the Big Creek Road No.386, Forest Road No. 18654. No pre-quote Site Visit is scheduled, however, Offerors are encouraged to visit the site and review the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision #52.236-3, Site Investigation and Conditions Affecting the Work (Apr 1984). Failure of the Offeror to ascertain the nature, location, and conditions which affect the work will not relieve the Offeror from the resposibility for successfully performing the work without addtional expense to the Government. Any questions regarding the project may be directed to Nate Kegel, at (406) 822-3927. The project cost estimate is $250,000 - $500,000. All work must be completed by 01 September 2011.

INTRODUCTIONBackgroundHampton National Historic Site (NHS) is a 63-acre unit of the National Park Service (NPS) in Baltimore County, Maryland, about 13 miles north of downtown Baltimore.  It is the remnant of a 24,000-acre industrial and agricultural estate amassed and stewarded by one Maryland family- the Ridgely family- during more than 200 years of America's development as a nation, from before the Revolutionary War until after World War II.  The present site encompasses the family mansion, with its formal gardens and grounds and their support building, and the farm house, dairy, slave and servants' quarters and other remains of the home farm, which supported the needs of the mansion and the workers in its immediate area.  The purpose of this project is to fabricate and reinstall fencing at Home Farm of Hampton NHS to restore the cultural landscape to its nineteenth century appearance.  The fencing is a contributing feature of the park nationally significant cultural landscape and is listed on the list of classified structures.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The purpose of this amendment to the synopsis is to change the closing date from June 25, 2010 to September 24, 2010. Please read below. All other terms and conditions remain the same.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the responsibility of enhancing national capabilities for decontamination and disposal as a result of terrorist events and environmental sampling and analysis of all environmental matrices in response to nationally significant incidents (NSI). To protect the nation from the potential threats posed by terrorism or environmental emergencies, the EPA implemented the Environmental Response Laboratory Network (ERLN). The ERLN is one of five laboratory response networks under the Integrated Consortium of Laboratory Networks (ICLN). The mission of the ERLN is to provide known laboratory capabilities, capacities, and quality data in a scalable, systematic, and coordinated response to environmental emergencies providing preparedness, response, remediation and recovery analytical support. Consequently, the USEPA Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) intends to establish Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) in accordance with FAR Part 16.703 with vendors who are capable of analyzing environmental sample matrices contaminated by toxic industrial chemicals (TICs), chemical warfare agents (CWAs), biological agents, and radiochemical agents as a result of acts of terrorism or an environmental emergency. A BOA is not a contract, as referenced in FAR Part 16.703; it is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor, that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA. Additionally, a BOA does not imply any agreement by the government to place future contracts or orders with the contractor or to be used in any manner to restrict competition. 
Potential vendors' viability will be evaluated on the following six factors: Accredited Quality System, Plans and Procedures, Sample Management System, Facilities for Sample Handling and Storage, Data Management and Exchange, and Integrated Consortium of Laboratory Networks (ICLN). The ERLN review team will review these documents and calculate a score for the application based on criteria established by the EPA. This score is used to determine if the laboratory is eligible for ERLN and, as applicable, Water Laboratory Alliance (WLA) membership.

This requirement will be posted for approximately  90 days with a closing date of September, 24, 2010 at 3:00 pm EST. A copy of this request for quote (RFQ) # RFQ-DC-09-00337 including attachments will be available at the following locations: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm, and https://www.fbo.gov/.
Please submit ERLN application packet via electronic mail or in hard copy form to EPA Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) using the address provided below. No phone calls please.

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): EEE CONSULTING INC, MECHANICSVILLE, VA, W912HN-09-P-0479, MASTER PLAN UPDATES<br><br>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because the procurement is awarded to a sole source under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (FAR 13.5). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>Control No:  CECT-SAW-J&A-10-01<BR>			<BR>       Justification and Approval (J&A) <BR>for Commercial Items (Supplies or Services)<BR>for Sole Source (including brand name) acquisitions <BR>1. Contracting Activity: U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Wilmington District, Wilmington Contracting Office, 69 Darlington Avenue, Wilmington, NC 28403<BR>2. Description of Action: Approval is being requested for a modification to a firm fixed price service contract  (W912HN-09-P-0479) to procure supplemental work necessary to complete the remaining phases of the Master Plan updates for Falls Lake and John H. Kerr Reservoir projects.  This supplemental work will result in complete Master Plans for those projects.  The source of funds will be Operations and Maintenance funds under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) program.<BR><BR>3. Description of Supplies/Services:  <BR><BR>a.	 The purpose of this action is for supplemental work to complete Master Plan Phases as follows:<BR><BR>Master Plan  Phase 2 and 3   (for Falls Lake, Design Memorandum No. 27)<BR>Master Plan  Phase 3              (for John H. Kerr Dam and Reservoir, Design Memorandum No. 5) <BR><BR>b.	 The Master Plan updates shall follow guidance set forth in the Scope of Work (SOW) and applicable U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Regulations (ER) and Pamphlets (EP).  Specific guidance on the format and content of a Master Plan is found in Chapter 3 of EP 1130-2-550.  The Master Plan updates shall ensure that environmental mandates and considerations are incorporated, with equal attention given to economy and quality in the development of new recreation facilities.<BR><BR>c.	 Supplemental work for each Master Plan update shall be project-specific and cover all resources, including but not limited to fish and wildlife, vegetation, cultural, aesthetic, interpretive, recreational, mineral, commercial, and outgranted lands, easements, and water.  Master Plan updates shall focus on three primary components: (1) regional and ecosystem needs, (2) project resource capabilities and suitability, and (3) expressed public interests and desires. <BR><BR>d.	The estimated total value (price) is $XX.XX The estimated price for each project is as follows:<BR><BR>    Falls Lake Phase 2			$ XXX,000<BR>    Falls Lake Phase 3			$ XXX,000<BR>    Total Falls Lake			$XXX,000<BR><BR>    John H Kerr Phase 3 		$ XXX,000<BR>    Total John H Kerr			$ XXX,000<BR><BR><BR>4. Authority Cited: 13.501(a)(1)(ii) Sole Source - Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 -   (Reference FAR Subpart 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and FAR 13.501 Special Documentation Requirements) <BR>5. Reason for Authority Cited: <BR><BR>a.	This proposed modification action is for logical follow-on action to a commercial item (services) contract (W912HN-09-P-0479) that was solicited under Subpart 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items using simplified procedures for the acquisition of the services in an amount greater than the simplified acquisition threshold.    <BR><BR>b.	The proposed sole source contractor is EEE Consulting Inc (EEE), 8525 Bell Creek Road, Mechanicsville, VA.   Contract award for Phase 1 for Falls Lake, Phase 1 and 2 for John H. Kerr Dam and Reservoir and Phases Phase 1, 2, and 3 for W. Kerr Scott Dam and Reservoir was made to EEE on September 29, 2009.    <BR><BR>c.	 Phase 1information is required to complete Phase 2.  It is estimated that 50% of the Phase 1 cost ($63,482.50 of $126,965) would be a duplicate cost to the Government if awarding Phase 2 to a different contractor. A different contractor would have to review Phase 1 documents, understand and interpret the documents, get familiar with the public comment process and reestablish coordination with State agencies.  Phase 1 requirements involve information gathering, exploration of needs, public meetings, discussions with State and Federal agencies and an enormous amount of research.  <BR><BR>d.	Phase 1 and Phase 2 information is required to complete complete Phase 3.  It is estimated that 40% of the Phase 2 cost ($38,244.40 of $95,611.00) would be a duplicate cost to the Government if awarding Phase 3 to a different contractor.  A different contractor would have to understand and evaluate comments from Phase 2, re-coordinate with State and Federal agencies and complete the Phase 3 document.  <BR><BR>e.	In performing contract requirements for Phase 1 at both Falls Lake and John H. Kerr Dam and Reservoir , EEE has familiarized themselves with the existing Master Plans at each project and the USACE regulations and guidance addressing preparation of Master Plans.  EEE has toured each project and met with  project staff and principals.  EEE has become aware of the uniqueness of these facilities.  EEE Consulting has prepared for and facilitated numerous public meeting at several locations in Virginia and North Carolina and met with the various agencies that manage project lands and the interested public users of the facilities.  EEE has developed an understanding and have responded to the uniqueness of the three projects.  EEE has assimilated large amounts of available information and begun the accumulation of an Administrative Record for the Master Plan development process.  Phase 1 work involves Phase 2 and Phase 3 are a logical follow-on work  <BR><BR>f.	 The experience and expertise of EEE Consulting Inc in the Master Plan Update process specifically for the Falls Lake and John H Kerr projects cannot be duplicated by another contractor without substantial duplication of efforts and costs.   It is estimated that any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government.  An estimate of duplicate costs would be $121,726,90 .  This cost of $121,726.90 is a total of $63,482.50  + $38,244.40 + $20,000 (Contracting/Proposal Evaluation) and significant delay of schedule (an estimated delay of 6 months).  The additional duplicative costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.  Additionally, the normal solicitation process would result in unacceptable delays due to the learning curve and essentially having to repeat previous steps.  While the information previously obtained in Phase 1 is public sector information, the organization, agency and public familiarity is not.  Retaining continuity for the project stakeholders and the public would significantly benefit the USACE.  The additional costs and time delays are unacceptable due to the need for updated Master Plan brought about by current developmental and usage pressures on these project lands.  Additional costs are unacceptable due to limited funding for the Master Plan Updates.  Additional costs would jeopardize completion of these tasks.  <BR>6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: This is a follow on action to an existing contract.  The contractor is in the final stage of the initial Scoping phases of the contract.  The requested modification of this contract will facilitate the continuity of the remaining phases and will maintain the current time schedules in sinc with the other actions currently underway.  It is in the governments best interest to follow on with the current contract.  The original contract action was a competitive request for proposal.  Seven (7) proposals were received.   EEE was determined the best value to the Government using the proposal factors of technical, past performance and price.   <BR>7. Actions to Increase Competition: This is a logical follow on action to an existing contract.  All future acquisitions of Master Plan actions will be competed.<BR>8. Market Research: Market research was conducted in September 2009 and seven (7) companies were found to be interested in the action.  Through a competitive solicitation process, using evaluation factors of price, technical and past performance, EEE Consultants was determined to be the best value for the government. <BR>9. Interested Sources: To date, no other sources have written to express an interest.  As required by Office of the Under Secretary of Defense memo, dated March 19, 2010, subject Revised Posting ad Reporting Requirements for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) (Attachment  Updated March 1, 2010) paragraph 2. And 3. any resulting modification award shall be posted on FedBizOpps to include this J&A.<BR>10. Other Facts: Discuss any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as the following:<BR>a. Procurement history. Reasonable efforts to retrieve the following items from computer records, contract files, competition advocate office files or other sources are expected:<BR>(1) Contract numbers and dates of the last several awards. <BR>Contract Number		Amount			Date<BR>W912HN-09-P0479		$ 612, 126 		29 September 2009<BR>(2) Competitive status of these actions: Competed<BR>(3) Authority previously used for less than full and open competition.

<DESC>The Aberdeen Area Indian Health Service is planning a sole-source purchase order with GE Healthcare for repairs on an X-ray machine at the Eagle Butte Indian Hospital in Eagle Butte, South Dakota. The repair is for an ADVANTX X-ray machine and batteries for an AMX portable X-ray machine (back-up equipment). Both of these machines are used for direct patient care. The main X-ray machine is not functional and the back-up machine is without batteries. GE is the only authorized vendor in the geographical area to maintain their equipment. The lack of operational equipment is impacting patient care, therefore repairs are essential and must be completed without further delay. <br />
<p><br />This announcement is a sole-source set-aside, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1. Any questions regarding this announcement can be directed to Donna Harwood, Purchasing Agent, Aberdeen Area Indian Health, Division of Acquisition Management at (605) 226-7332.
