In accordance with FAR 5.207 (c) (15) (ii); all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.
Qualification Requirements:  Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.  
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov. Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to Patrick McGowan at (405) 734-8120; fax (405) 734-8129, or e-mail patrick.mcgowan@tinker.af.mil

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Rock Island, on behalf of the Project Director for Joint Products, intends to award a firm fixed price contract modification to W52P1J-12-C-0051 with Allied Mechanical Wisconsin, a division of Tower Industries, for an  quote mark add-on quote mark  quantity of Bomb Dummy Unit (BDU)-50D/B Cast Ductile Iron (CDI) practice bombs (NSN:  1325-01-607-6844).  The BDU-50D/B CDI practice bombs are used by the United States Air Force for training to simulate the size and weight of explosive filled general purpose bombs.  <br>  <br> The BDU-50D/B is manufactured from casting material with specifications of American Society for Testing and Materials A536 Grade 60-40-18 cast ductile iron. The BDU-50D/B is 60.572 inches long, up to 10.75 inches in diameter, and ranging from 1.145 - 1.624 inch nominal wall thickness, with an average weight of 485 pounds.  The thick wall design eliminates the need for inert fill. The final BDU-50D/B assembly includes the installation of threaded inserts into the lug holes, base and nose plug assemblies, and installation of various components. MHU-149 pallets and MS3314 Suspension Lugs required for assembly will be provided as Government Furnished Material.  This proposed action will not include an option provision. <br>  <br> Manufacturing of the BDU-50D/B CDI practice bomb requires special facilities, equipment, skills, and processes. Production requires large foundry facilities, conventional and Computer Numerically Controlled machining equipment, phosphate coating, and paint booths. All of this equipment is required to produce and handle large metal casting molds. The specific, critical, and unique skills required for large-scale production of the BDU-50D/B CDI practice bomb includes metallurgy, pattern making, mold-making, metals casting, phosphate coating, and machining. The production process for the BDU-50D/B involves the casting of a bomb body, machining of the bomb body, threading of the lug holes, inspection/testing, phosphate coating, painting, and assembling. The BDU-50D/B requires extensive quality inspection. Tensile tests, destructive tests, impact tests, magnetic particle inspection, radiography tests, and ultrasonic wall thickness measurements will all be conducted as part of the Lot Acceptance Test requirements. <br>  <br> This proposed add-on acquisition is under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-3, Industrial Mobilization; Engineering, Developmental, or Research Capability; or expert services.  As implemented by FAR 6.302-3(b)(1)(i), the use of other than full and open competition is necessary to keep vital facilities or suppliers in business or make them available in the event of a national emergency. <br>  <br> While a new competitive acquisition is in process for the BDU-50D/B CDI practice bomb, other potential sources cannot meet the customer's required delivery date for this add-on quantity due to the acquisition and production lead-times. <br>  <br> This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, as no solicitation package will be issued.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation via email to Rachel M. Phelps, Contracting Officer at rachel.m.phelps2.civ@mail.mil.  The Agency will consider any such submission.   <br>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - Redstone Arsenal intends to issue a solicitation to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (NGSC), 2340 Dulles Corner Blvd, Herndon, VA 20171, on a sole source basis for the Counter - Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) production and fielding of the RAM Warn capability. The system will be fielded to Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs). Support efforts, including fielding  and new equipment training will also be procured. The procurement is for approximately 20,499 labor hours with a Period of Performance of approximately 15 months. The anticipated type of contract will be Cost-plus-incentive-fee. <br>  <br> NGSC is the only known source with the specialized technical expertise to satisfy the military-unique Army RAM Warn capability requirements.  NGSC has been the single source to provide the communications architecture/systems engineering, integration, installation, communications network support, hardware, test, and logistics support for the RAM Warn system.  Due to these years of experience, no other firm has the developmental and operational expertise and knowledge necessary to produce and integrate a comparable warning system.  Another source would need to develop the necessary highly specialized expertise and overcome an extensive learning curve to gain the experience necessary to produce, integrate, and field the RAM Warn capability.  Attempts by another source to duplicate the required knowledge base to perform the RAM Warn effort would present overwhelming engineering, technical, and logistical challenges, resulting in additional financial resources and time that are not available to the Government.   <br>  <br> This synopsis is issued for informational purposes only and is being posted on the Federal Business Opportunities page.

<p><br />THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE.</p>
<p>Title: Resource for the Collection and Evaluation of Human Tissue, Cells, and Bio-fluids from Donors with an Epidemiologic Profile</p>
<p>This contract is the essential resource serving the Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis (LHC) research program. It supports molecular epidemiology studies of human lung, breast, prostate, liver and pancreatic cancer; as well as, the molecular pathogenesis and translational studies of all these diseases. LHC studies the induction of cancer directly in human tissues and cells. This requires a reliable source of fresh, professionally obtained human specimens.</p>
<p>The contract initially began as a pilot to obtain tissues for the experimental development of conditions to culture human specimens as organ and cellular tissues. The focus at that time was to obtain case-series cancer and adjacent uninvolved tissues from consented patients as they underwent surgery.  Cancer cases have been obtained primarily from the Baltimore Veteran's Administration Hospital, the University of Maryland Medical Center, and Johns Hopkins University Hospital (historically). Beginning in 1996, focus shifted to case-control studies which still included collection of material from cancer patients, but also healthy population based controls, recruited from the Maryland Department of Motor Vehicles records.  Population controls were recruited based on matching to the cancer cases by geographic location (Baltimore City, Maryland and surrounding selected counties), gender, and race (Caucasian, African-American, and Asian).</p>
<p>In addition to human tissues for research, the resource provides corresponding epidemiology profiles that include occupational histories, personal health history, family health history, smoking information, and exercise information via informed consent. Addition of medical record abstracts and pathological reports complete questionnaires.  Personal Identifying Information is excluded when data or samples are delivered to the NIH.  Further, the contract provides histology slides and histopathological interpretations by professionals. Unstained regular, standard and immuno-stained slides will be made available for staining and interpretation in LHC.</p>
<p>The LHC, a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) certified laboratory with a record of assays that are designed for clinical application, uses integrative biology and translational research strategies to investigate the molecular epidemiology of human cancer. To that end, the contractor shall be responsible for: 1) identifying and recruiting cancer cases and population-based controls; 2) obtaining informed consent and maintaining Institutional Review Board approvals; 3) collecting and storing subject interview data, and 4) collecting and processing biological specimens and transferring the de-identified materials (data and specimens) to the LHC.  The work is currently being conducted under contract HHSN261201000117C held by The University of Maryland.</p>
<p>The NCI seeks continuation of services to be acquired through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 622110. It is anticipated that a cost-reimbursement, completion-type contract with a base period of one year and four one year option periods may be awarded beginning on or about September 30, 2015.</p>
<p>Mandatory Criteria: This criterion establishes conditions that must be met at the time of receipt of award.  Companies that fail to meet these requirements will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>&bull;	Must demonstrate the ability to facilitate delivery of non-frozen viable tissues to the NIH campus within two (2) hours of receiving them from the pathologist, at all times of the day.</p>
<p>The RFP will be available electronically at a later date and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov. WE ENCOURAGE ALL RESPONSIBLE SOURCES, PARTICULARLY SMALL BUSINESSES, TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE AGENCY. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile or email transmissions will be accepted. IT IS THE OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE ABOVE MENTIONED SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION AND ANY AMENDMENTS.</p>

This requirement is for the replacement of this obsolete equipment. This equipment does not operate as stand-alone equipment; rather, it operates as part of a wider integrated Navy ELMR infrastructure, which is based upon the utilization the Motorola ASTRO25 IV&amp;D trunking radio system. Only Motorola equipment (subscribers, dispatch consoles etc) is 100% compatible within the infrastructure of the existing system.</p>

The DSR and OTAP technologies are proprietary to Motorola and it is the only manufacturer capable of providing both voice and data over the existing Motorola ASTRO 25 IV&amp;D trunking radio system. The OTAP capability has not been standardized between manufacturers equipment and is not interchangeable or interoperable within the existing infrastructure of the ELMR system. Therefore all radios used on the worldwide ELMR network must utilize Motorola proprietary OTAP technology to be fully managed and reprogrammed over the air.</p>

<DESC><p>Pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), the Contracting Officer may solicit from one source if the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source is reasonably available. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Acquisition Management Services (AMS), on behalf of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) intends to sole source to:</p>
<p>Faces and Voices of Recovery (FAVOR)<br />1010 Vermont Avenue<br />Suite 618<br />Washington, DC 20005-4941</p>
<p>Organizations made up of individuals with lived experience, called Recovery Community Organizations (RCOs), are becoming and will continue to emerge as major players in the behavioral health delivery system. SAMHSA recognizes the need to ensure that RCOs are fully equipped to expand the behavioral health workforce and to meet the needs of those being served with high-quality services. A key strategy for ensuring the quality of peer services is to accredit RCOs that provide peer recovery support services.</p>
<p>SAMHSA is seeking to support the expansion of Peer Recovery Support Services (PRSS) as a key component of the continuum of care for people seeking, stabilizing, and sustaining recovery from addiction to alcohol and other drugs. In this effort, SAMHSA is seeking to promote a commitment to quality assurance and integrity of peer recovery community services and recovery community organizations that provide PRSS. Through this acquisition, SAMHSA seeks to share information with recovery community organizations and allied behavioral health treatment and recovery concerning the effectiveness of peer recovery support services through standards and measures; components of quality and ethical peer practice; increase access to high quality recovery supports within communities; and to advance peer services as a component of health care delivery through a specialized recovery community organization accreditation framework.</p>
<p>Faces and Voices of Recovery (FAVOR) is the primary organization committed to organizing and mobilizing the over 23 millions of Americans in recovery from addiction to alcohol and other drugs, their families, friends, and allies to advocate for the addiction recovery community. FAVOR has been the sole organization to establish a network of recovery community organizations. In 2011, FAVOR hosted a consultation meeting with recovery community organization representatives to explore the possibility of establishing an accreditation system for organizations and programs providing with peer recovery support services. The group showed congruent thinking and fundamental agreement on the need for a process of accreditation and the development of standards focusing on PRSS. Since that time, FAVOR has developed a set of core domains in the effective delivery of PRSS, and has field tested an accreditation process in six recovery community organizations. SAMHSA is recommending FAVOR as a sole source for the work outlined to continue the readiness for the accreditation of recovery community organizations and those that provide peer recovery supports services to those individuals and their families in or seeking recovery from addiction to alcohol and other drugs. As indicated, FAVOR has established an accreditation process specifically for recovery community organizations and is the only organization that has developed and initiated an accreditation process and accompanying technical assistance for addiction peer recovery organizations.</p>
<p>Description of Tasks:</p>
<p>Task 1 and 2 - Conference Call/Work Plan</p>
<p>Fourteen (14) days after receipt of order, FAVOR shall participate in a conference call meeting with the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) to discuss the requirements and deliverables of the task order. Within one (1) month of the conference call, FAVOR shall produce a brief (e.g., 3-5 pages) work plan outlining key activities and action steps to successfully accomplish the tasks below. The Work Plan will describe the key tasks to be conducted, an implementation time table and describe how key tasks will be coordinated.</p>
<p>Task 3 - Develop Accreditation Readiness Tools</p>
<p>FAVOR shall develop at least three (3) accreditation readiness on-line tools. These tools shall be developed in concert with a review of the consistent areas that were identified as "needing improvement" in the 2014 round of accreditations and upon completions of a survey of other existing readiness tools. The tools shall be brief, clear and easy to understand. The tools shall be used as a means for self-assessment for Recovery Community Organizations (RCOs) to determine their level of readiness for accreditation and to assist in preparing for the accreditation process. Draft versions of the tools shall be provided to the COR within 75 days of award. Final versions shall be provided within 45 days of COR comments/revisions.<br /><br />Task 4 - Revise Core Standards</p>
<p>FAVOR shall revise core standards used in the RCO accreditation process based on findings from the 2014 accreditation process with RCOs. One DRAFT revision of the core standards shall be submitted to the COR within 90 days after receipt of order (ARO). A FINAL version of the core standards will be provided to the COR within 120 days after receipt of order (ARO).</p>
<p>Task 5 - Develop Standards in Optional Domains</p>
<p>FAVOR shall develop at least two additional optional performance-based domains: (1) Telephone and New Media Support, (2) PRSS Training. Other performance-based domains may emerge. Within 60 days after receipt of order (ARO), FAVOR will provide the COR a DRAFT of the (2) optional domain standards and the measures for each. Within 120 days after receipt of order (ARO), FAVOR will present a final version of the standards and their measures.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />Task 6 - Develop a Cloud-Based Standardized Data Collection and Management Tool for PRSS programs</p>
<p>A cloud-based standardized data collection and management tool that will assist PRSS programs in easy data collection and reporting will be developed. This tool will allow for data collection and management of process, outcome, and impact measures, and will be designed for users who are not specific data experts. It will be easily accessible and customer-friendly. The tool will include the ability to input data, analyze and aggregate data, and will include reports that can be used at the program level for programmatic decisions, process reviews, and marketing of PRSS to funders, systems level organizers, health care systems, etc. The data management tool should be easily modifiable by the owner, so that updates can be made. FAVOR shall deliver a report on the frame of the Data Collection Management tool and its features 90 days after receipt of order (ARO). Within 270 days after receipt of order (ARO), a Cloud-Based Standardized Data Collection and Management Tool for PRSS programs will be delivered to the COR.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive proposal. No solicitation document is available. All responsible sources that have determined that they can provide the same services may submit product information and a capabilities statement. The email subject line must reference SAM151722 Recovery Community Organization Accreditation (RCOA). All responses are due by May 29, 2015, 6:00PM Eastern Time and can be sent to Daren Davis at daren.davis@psc.hhs.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract base upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>

<DESC>By way of this Notice and in accordance with the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, the Chicago District, US Army Corps of Engineers, announces its intention to award a sole source contract to Smith Root Incorporated (SRI) of Vancouver, Washington, for the purpose of installing electronics equipment, controls, and power distribution, whereby, SRI will integrate their uniquely designed and patented pulse generators to enable the proper operation of the new Permanent Barrier I electronic systems that were acquired under the previously awarded USACE Contract No. W912P6-13-C-0024. This contract also includes installation of control devices electrical power distribution equipment associated with the pulse generating systems.
<p><br /><br />Under the previously awarded contract to SRI, the company supplied pulse generators, switches and electrical distribution devices, which are customized and are considered the only ones of its type capable of meeting the demands of the Dispersal Barrier technology. All intellectual property rights pertaining to these unique components belong exclusively to SRI and its vendors. Further, SRI has research, proprietary arts, trade secret technology not open to the public that they use in fish barrier designs and components therein, thereby making SRI the only source capable of satisfying the government's requirements of this proposed contract. <br /><br />To further add, the integration of these key components into the project's electrical and mechanical systems will require the use of SRI's uniquely skilled and highly reliable labor force, already having the intimate knowledge of the Barrier's mechanical and electronic systems. Under the previous contract, SRI performed at an optimal level, as its labor force demonstrated its capabilities to properly document their specialized components, and remain on schedule to meet the critical timeframes imposed by the tight overall project schedule. In this regard, it is deemed necessary to obtain coordination services from the original source (SRI) to continue an agile operation of the Barrier without disruption and to avoid a substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered by way of competition. In addition, the government cannot afford any delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements since the Barrier itself protects the ecosystem from two species of invasive Asian carp.</p>
<p>Under the proposed contract, the overall contract completion time will be 540 calendar days. The contract will result in a firm-fixed price contract.</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers, proposals, etc. However, interested firms may send a capabilities statement NO LATER THAN June 7, 2015. Statements should be sent to the attention of Wesley (Dale) Dewar at wesley.d.dewar@usace.army.mil; ensure that the subject line of your email includes the title/description of this announcement. Award is anticipated on or about July 31, 2015. This announcement is in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1). The point of contact is Mr. Dewar at (312) 312-846-5370.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><br /><br />The Division of Acquisition Policy (DAP) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Indian Health Service (IHS) wants to identify viable small businesses and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) owned businesses that can provide the IHS Division of Diabetes Treatment and Prevention (DDTP) a broad range of experts and professional staff to conduct essential and ongoing programmatic work related to: <br /><br />1) the organization and successful operations of the DDTP national network and DDTP meetings and workgroups; <br />2) coordination, review, and evaluation of AI/AN clinical and public health programs; <br />3) translation of diabetes research to information and resources for clinical practice; <br />4) dissemination of evidence based information and resources; and <br />5) project management services. While these functions are critical to the success of DDTP programs, they are not inherently federal functions.<br /><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><br />This is a Small Business and AI/AN owned Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: <br />(1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; <br />(2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses;<br />(3) AI/AN owned businesses; and <br />(4) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.&nbsp;<br /></span><br /><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong><br /><br />The mission of the Indian Health Service (IHS), Division of Diabetes Treatment and Prevention (DDTP) is to develop, document, and sustain a public health effort to prevent and control diabetes and related chronic diseases in America Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people and communities. The DDTP employs collaborative strategies in the 12 IHS Areas through coordination of a network of Area Diabetes Consultants, and approximately 500 Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) grant programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In addition, the DDTP is the primary point of contact for inter-agency as well as intra-agency communication on the prevention and treatment of diabetes and related chronic diseases in AI/AN communities.<br /><br />The SDPI program was initially established and authorized by Congress through the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>It has since been augmented and reauthorized, extending it through 2015.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Currently funded at $150 million per year, DDTP has only two permanent professional federal employees to administer all of the SDPI grant programs, including coordinating and implementing the entire competitive grant application process for FY 2016.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>As a result of this shortage in federal staffing, as well as the necessity of continuing work on this and other mission critical national projects, including the First Lady's "Let's Move! In Indian Country" (LMIC) initiative, the DDTP is in need of a cadre of professionals with experience in working with AI/AN communities to provide expertise in biostatistics, medical review, data analysis, communications, medical nutrition therapy, program review and evaluation, federal grants management, web site development and design, project management, and writing and editing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; <br /></span><br />This contract will support IHS DDTP program activities and initiatives by providing professional expertise and management of the tasks that will be detailed in the scope of work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>It will require as many as 20 to 30 specialists that can provide services for varying amounts of time throughout the year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The quality, quantity, and timeliness of performed services will make a significant impact on the DDTP mission and overall program performance and will ultimately affect key stakeholders that include IHS leadership and IHS/Tribal/Urban (I/T/U) healthcare programs nationwide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This contract will be for five periods, a base period and four option periods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The contract type is intended to be a Firm-Fixed price. <br /><br />The Dissemination of Information and Resources tasks are focused on continued development and utilization of the IHS DDTP website as the primary platform for dissemination of information and resources for clinical staff and SDPI grantees. This also includes continued provision of virtual trainings (DDTP, Audit, SDPI Grant, LMIC, and Clinical) as a key venue for dissemination of information and resources for clinical staff and SDPI grantees.<br /><br />At present, services are being provided under a current IHS contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>A new contract needs to be in place by the current contract expiration date with staff that has the professional expertise and experience needed to immediately provide the necessary services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This will ensure absolute continuity and avoid disruption of services to the SDPI grant programs throughout the nation along with critical projects that are already underway.</p>

<DESC>This notice is for market research and planning purpose only and does not obligate the Government to any contractual agreement. This is not a request for proposal. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses, nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted, nor will respondents be notified of the review of the information received. The information obtained from this Request for Information (RFI) will be utilized as market research for consideration in development of the Acquisition Strategy and Acquisition Plan for this requirement. The Government will not reimburse interested sources for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract.
<p><br />The purpose of this Request for Information is to determine the companies capable of performing the effort described herein.</p>
<p>1. BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The mission of the International Trade Administration (ITA) of the Department of Commerce is to strengthen the competitiveness of U.S. industry, promote trade and investment, and ensure fair trade through the rigorous enforcement of U.S. trade laws and agreements. Global Markets (GM) is one of three business units within ITA that promotes this mission. GM promotes U.S. exports, particularly those of small- and medium-sized enterprises, and protects United States commercial interests abroad through market access case work.</p>
<p>GM operates a network of offices in 108 domestic locations and in more than 120 cities in 79 markets. Overseas offices are staffed by 245 Foreign Service Officers (approximately 40 officers also serve in domestic assignments) and approximately 960 locally hired employees. Domestic offices are staffed by 322 trade specialists, Foreign Service officers on domestic tours, and support staff. GM uses a "Domestic Resource Allocation Model" (DRAM) and an "Overseas Resource Allocation Model" (ORAM) to guide decision-making about domestic and international employee allocation. The DRAM includes small and medium-sized (SME) enterprise counts weighted by factors derived from Industry Export Intensiveness data at the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and County levels, as well as forecasts for growth in SME counts. The ORAM model includes economic/commercial data related to market potential for U.S. exports and to GM's mission, and produces a ranking of countries, with higher-ranked countries warranting more staff than lower-ranked countries. The data are used by GM's senior management in making informed resource allocation decisions. The model relies upon current (as of the time of contract award) economic data, although the existing data can be used as a template to guide the construction/validation of the new model. The DRAM model includes data informing the export intensiveness of key industry sectors, and the counts of SMEs by sectors at the MSA and County levels. Both models are reviewed and vetted internally by ITA's Industry &amp; Analysis (I&amp;A) unit, which is the unit within ITA that provides data, analysis, and recommendations on policy and promotion issues affecting U.S. industry competitiveness in a global setting to maximize U.S. gains in trade negotiations.</p>
<p>2. DESCRIPTION/:</p>
<p>GM is seeking Contractor support services to update its ORAM and DRAM. Both models were last updated in December 2014. The duration of this contract is five (5) years; this will include a base year and four (4) option years.</p>
<p>- The Contractor shall propose, develop, and implement a methodology to revalidate and update the DRAM, ORAM, and Industry Export Intensiveness data. &lsquo;Validate' means that the model is accurate and reliable in serving its intended purpose. Factors determining reliability and accuracy include application of variables directly relevant to GM's mission, using best available data sources, eliminating extraneous or redundant variables, and assessing implications of variances. The purpose of the models is to provide an objective reference point and an aid for GM decision making for the allocation of domestic and overseas resources based on the best potential for U.S. exporters.</p>
<p>- The Contractor shall have the personnel and resources to provide efficient and cost-effective support services to revalidate, revise accordingly, and update the Domestic Resource Allocation Model, Overseas Resource Allocation Model, and the Industry Export Intensiveness data.</p>
<p>- The Contractor shall develop and implement a methodology to revalidate, revise, and <br />update the DRAM. &lsquo;Validate' means that the model is accurate and reliable from the standpoint of serving its intended purpose. Factors affecting accuracy and reliability to be included in the model: <br />- Variables directly relevant to GM's mission and resource allocation decisions<br />- Use of best available data sources<br />- Elimination of extraneous or redundant variables<br />- Comparison of current resource allocation practices to model-suggested allocation to assess implications of variances.</p>
<p>- Among the activities the Contractor shall include in development of the models: <br />- Meet with Industry &amp; Analysis (I&amp;A) officials conducting economic/commercial analyses in support of NEI (National Export Initiative) Next (e.g., to identify top country/export sector combinations) to consider whether/how these analytic approaches should be incorporated into the DRAM and the ORAM. <br />- Identify variables that could be dropped (based on redundancy or for other reasons).<br />- Consider variables that could supersede existing data streams as more reliable, more comprehensive, or better indicators of what the variable signifies.<br />- Consider new variables based on availability of new data streams directly relevant to the <br />model's purpose or consider a new analytic approach if merited based on the model review process.<br />- Consider incorporating add-factors to the model that are based on Administration priorities, if relevant to the model's purpose and aligned with GM's central resource allocation strategy.<br />- Perform sensitivity analysis. For example, check model results for consistency across countries, and alter weights ("shock" the model) within data categories to determine whether this affects the overall tier in which a country is ranked. <br />- Cross-check model-suggested allocation with current staff allocation and assess implications of anomalies.<br />- Provide documentation for data selection/elimination and citations for data sources.<br />- For the DRAM, ensure that data at the MSA and county levels on SME counts by sector is included. Propose a means to map those data with ITA-defined industry sectors in the assignment of both Sector leaders positions and the proper assignment of industry sector responsibilities to client-facing personnel.<br />- Design and document the model such that ITA technical staff can conduct routine updates and make modifications in the future. Meet with ITA technical staff prior to finalizing documentation to answer questions and ensure documentation answers questions raised.</p>

<p>1.	Background</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH)/ National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)/ Division of Intramural Research (DIR)  is the nation's leading medical research agency whose mission is to support and conduct world-class research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of neurological disorders and stroke. The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.</p>
<p>The Protein/Peptide Sequencing (PPS) Facility, as a part of the NINDS, provides amino acid sequencing of purified proteins/peptides for NIH-wide investigators. The facility is also available for collaborations involving protein/peptide purification and more complicated sequencing strategies. To meet this aim the NINDS Protein/Peptide Sequencing Facility needs a highly sensitive mass spectrometer to precisely measure and analyze protein and peptides, small molecules and a defined set of biomarkers with high selectivity and sensitivity. The instrument will support PPS, the wider research comminuty in the NIH/NINDS, and ensure compliance with CLIA certification.</p>
<p>2.	Objective</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to obtain an  Accurate Mass Time-of-Flight (TOF) Liquid Chromotography (LC) Mass Spectrometer (MS) System with an Agilent Jet Stream or equivalent system for the NIH/NINDS Protein Peptide Sequencing Facility.<br /> <br />3.	Scope</p>
<p>The mass spectrometer must:<br />&bull;	Has a mass range of 25-20,000 m/z which is critical when measuring large intact proteins. <br />&bull;	Is able to obtain up to 30 spectra/second - this is critical when coupling with the 1290 UHPLC system which has very narrow peak widths.<br />&bull;	Does not use an ion trapping design which can limit ability to detect low abundance ions in the presence of more abundant species due to space charging effects.</p>

<p>1.	Background</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH)/ National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)/ Division of Intramural Research (DIR)  is the nation's leading medical research agency whose mission is to support and conduct world-class research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of neurological disorders and stroke. The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.</p>
<p>Intravital two-photon laser scanning microscopy is one of the most important and instructive techniques used in the Viral Immunology and Intravital Imaging Section laboratory. The laboratory is routinely limited in its multi-parameter two-photon imaging studies by its inability to excite red and far red fluorescent proteins and is therefore upgrading its outdated SP5 microscope to a SP8 or equivalent system.</p>
<p>2.	Objective</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to provide the Viral Immunology and Intravital Imaging Section with an upgrade of an existing Leica SP5 two-photon microscope to a SP8 or equivalent system.  This upgrade is needed to significantly improve the light path and detectors to allow more efficient passage of light above 1000 nm. <br /> <br />3.	Scope</p>
<p>The Leica TCS SP8 or equivalent system  shall provide:<br />&bull;	The ability to optimally excite fluorophores / fluorescent proteins with wavelengths greater than 550 nm (e.g. red fluorescent protein, mCherry, tdTomato).<br />&bull;	Optimal passage of light above 1000nm.<br />&bull;	Quad Module and 4 Channel HyD NDD Detection<br />&bull;	Digital fixed stage microscope with motorized focus drive for transmitted light, epi fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy</p>

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a SOURCES SOUGHT notice announcement only. This synopsis is a market research tool being utilized by the Department of the Navy (DoN) for informational and planning purposes. The information received will be utilized by the Navy Clothing and Textile Research Facility (NCTRF) to facilitate the acquisition decision-making process. 

This is a survey of the market of potential vendors capable of providing the services defined herein.    Based upon this survey a decision will be made whether sufficient sources exist to solicit the requirement on a full and open, competitive basis. 

This notice does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ), Invitation for Bid (IFB), or Request for Proposal (RFP), and it does not commit the Government to issue an RFQ, IFB, or RFP in the future.
 It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than market research and is not restricted to a particular acquisition approach.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  Respondents will not be notified of the evaluation, and any information submitted by respondents to this notice is strictly voluntary. 

The Navy Clothing and Textile Research Facility (NCTRF), located in Natick, MA, is seeking eligible firms capable of providing research and development (R and D) services to design, develop, test, evaluate, and fabricate prototypes for clothing and equipment with chemical/biological (CB), ballistic, flame resistant, and other types of protection.
 

Interested firms are encouraged to respond. Upon review of the industry response to this Sources Sought synopsis, the Government will move forward with the acquisition approach that is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. The appropriate NAICS Code is 541712. THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of an award. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis. It is requested that interested businesses submit to the contracting office a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 10 pages single-sided and 5 pages double-sided in length, single-spaced, 12-point font minimum) demonstrating an ability to perform the requested services.

Project Description: 

-  NCTRF develops government-owned chemical/biological (CB) protective clothing systems in support of  the Joint Program Manager Protection (JPM P).
 NCTRF also routinely supports JPM P sustainment items such as the Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST), Joint Protective Aircrew Ensemble (JPACE), and the Joint Chemical/Biological Coverall for Combat Vehicle Crewmen (JC3).  Personnel with expertise specific to developing CB clothing and equipment, with knowledge of CB swatch and system level testing methods, and with extensive knowledge of JPM P sustainment items are required to support these developments.  

-  NCTRF requires contractor support in the form of research and development (R and D) services to design, develop, test, evaluate, and fabricate prototypes for clothing and equipment with chemical/biological (CB), ballistic, flame resistant, and other types of protection.
  The primary purpose of the requirement is to study, analyze, advise, research, and develop deliverables to advance scientific and technical information through the application of knowledge and resources in achieving NCTRFs mission.  The requirement will be fulfilled through contractor R and D support for CB and multifunctional protection technologies, encompassing development from technology inception to transition.  Support will include maturation, demonstration, and transition of new technologies while also providing Science and Technology (S and T) solutions for the sustainment of fielded technologies.  This will be accomplished through analysis of CB, ballistic, flame resistant, and other protection technologies and systems, and analysis of resulting test data.
   Additional program support shall include market surveys; the identification of emerging requirements; materials and design concept development; the fabrication of design concept prototypes for new protective clothing and equipment systems; the conducting of laboratory tests and field demonstrations; analysis;  reporting; and documentation.  To perform the required level of testing and evaluation for the CB materials and ensembles, NCTRF requires the contractor to possess Government-validated facilities and experienced personnel capable of  conducting the live agent swatch testing and the Man-In-Simulant Test (MIST) for the purpose of determining the efficacy of chemical and biological protection.
 

Documentation provided by interested firms shall address, at a minimum, the following: 

(1) Relevant Experience: Provide no more than two (2) projects, to include experience in performing efforts of similar size, scope, and magnitude within the last five years.  The following information shall be included: contract numbers; indication of whether the firm performed the effort as a prime or subcontractor; contract dollar values; Government/Agency points of contact with valid, current telephone numbers; and a brief description of how the referenced contract relates to the technical services described herein. No more than two relevant projects shall be submitted. 

(2) Company profile to include number of employees, office location(s), DUNS number, CAGE Code, and statement regarding business size designation and status as they relate to the applicable NAICS code.
 

(3) A description of the firms capabilities (e.g., facilities, personnel, etc.) as they relate to the required work, in particular the various types of research, development, testing, and analysis described herein; firms should demonstrate their understanding of chemical/biological (CB), ballistic, flame resistant, and other types of protection.  

Interested parties should send the requested information, as well as any questions or comments, to Bridget Blaney (Code 270.3F) via email at bridget.blaney@navy.mil no later than 12:00PM Eastern Standard Time on 1 June 2015.  LATE SUBMISSIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), in support of the Program Executive Office Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (PEO C4I) Communications Program Office (PMW/A 170) is seeking information from industry regarding the a future competitive procurement of Global Positioning System (GPS) Based Positioning Navigation and Timing Service hardware.  GPNTS receives, processes, and distributes three dimensional position, velocity, acceleration, attitude, time and frequency in the formats required by shipboard user systems.  GPNTS is a single Program of Record (POR) for U.S. Navy ships as well as potential U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) platforms.  The Navy plans to install GPNTS systems on the following platforms: Carrier, Fixed Wing Aircraft, Nuclear (CVN), Guided Missile Cruiser (CG), Guided Missile Destroyer (DDG), Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), Amphibious Assault Ship - General Purpose (LHA), Amphibious Assault Ship  Multipurpose (LHD), Amphibious Transport Dock (LPD), and Landing Ship, Dock (LSD). GPNTS is being designed to accommodate back- fit of current legacy PNT systems and forward-fit of new platforms, in accordance with the GPNTS Technical Requirements Document (TRD) and Statement of Work (SOW).  The GPNTS system is currently being developed using a commercial, open- systems architecture approach, to meet user requirements in a net-centric Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) environment. The GPNTS system incorporates embedded Non- Developmental Item (NDI) military- grade Selective Availability Anti- Spoofing Module (SAASM) GPS receivers, and includes anti-jam GPS antenna systems as Government Furnished Property (GFP). The GPNTS system includes three (3) configurations, Configuration A (one rack) for smaller surface combatants, Configuration B (two rack) for large surface combatants, and Configuration C (three rack) for large surface combatants requiring Synchro Generation capability.  In addition, the U.S. Air Force GPS Directorate is currently developing Military Code (M- Code) capable Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE). MGUE is currently planned to be available for GPNTS integration and test in Fiscal Year (FY) 16. Pending the results of this effort, the GPNTS program will decide whether to initiate production with an M-CODE configuration, or transition from the SAASM configuration to M-code at a point in time after GPNTS has entered production.  The GPNTS Technical Data Package (TDP) has been uploaded to the Net Centric Solutions for Interoperability (NESI) secure website; the GPNTS software source code and software documentation will be uploaded in the near future.  Instructions on how to obtain NESI access are provided in Section 2.4 of the RFI.  The Government desires industry to review and provide comments on the completeness and adequacy of the data to support a competitive procurement of GPNTS hardware and software support. This RFI is being conducted in two steps. First, questions and comments from industry on the GPNTS TDP and software source code/software documentation shall be submitted to the Government not later than 30 June 2015.  After Government review and responses to questions and comments, interested parties are requested to respond in writing to this RFI with a white paper.  Details regarding the format and content of white papers are contained in the RFI document. White papers are due not later than 1400 Pacific Time, 30 July 2015.

<DESC>Solicit Comments on Potential Use of Project Labor Agreements for the Repair of Taxiway, Dyess Air Force Base, Texas  <br> Source Sought for PLAs Regarding Solicitation:  W9126G-15-R-0029 <br> Title:  Soliciting Comments on Potential Use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) for the Repair of Taxiway, Dyess Air Force Base, Texas <br> Description:  The Fort Worth District Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) for the Repair of Taxiway, Dyess Air Force Base  <br> Range of Magnitude:  $25 - $50 Million.   <br> Some of the factors that maybe considered regarding their use are: <br> a.)	The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <br> b.)	The complexity of the project. <br> c.)	Shortage of skilled labor in the region. <br> d.)	Completion of the project will require an extended period of time. <br> e.)	The use of PLA's on other comparable projects. <br> f.)	The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects. <br> g.)	The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. <br> h.)	Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive. <br> PLA is defined as a Pre-Hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). <br> Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), Policy: <br> a.)	Project Labor Agreement,(PLA), is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, Agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. <br> b.)	An Agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree for that project to negotiate or become party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the Agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will: <br> 1.)	Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, produce-labor management stability and ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health. Equal opportunity, labor and employment standards and other matters and... <br> 2.)	Be consistent with law. <br> Reference Provision: 52.222-23 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreements. <br> In consideration of the above factors and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLA's. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br> a.)	Should PLA's be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the Dyess Air Force Base? What other factors should the Corps of Engineers consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for the utilization of a PLA? <br> b.)	Is the use of PLA's effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government if using PLA's? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer? <br> c.)	Is the use of PLA's effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? <br> d.)	Is the use of PLA's conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLA's used for those specific contracts? <br> e.)	Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing working in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both prime contractor and at least one subcontractor or two or more subcontractors employing the same trade?  <br> f.)	Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics. <br> g.)	Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance period. Will a PLA impact completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? <br> h.)	Where have PLA's been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, Municipal or private entities in the Dyess Air Force Base area? <br> i.)	Will the use of PLA's impact the ability of potential offerors and/or subcontractors to meet the Small Business utilization goals? <br> Please provide your comments via email ONLY to: julie.meyer@usace.army.mil no later than close of business on 4 June 2015.   <br> Agency/Contracting Office:   <br> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District <br> ATTN: CESWF-CT (Rm 2A19) <br> 819 Taylor Street <br> Fort Worth, Texas  76102-0300 <br>  <br> Place of Performance: <br> Dyess Air Force Base, Texas  <br>  <br> Point of Contact: <br> Julie Meyer  <br> Corps of Engineers <br> julie.meyer@usace.army.mil   <br> Fort Worth District <br>

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source contract with Delta-Xray Incorporated, 2111 Wilson Blvd, STE 700, Arlington, VA 22201. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
<p><br />This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 334517, Irradiation Apparatus Manufacturing; the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to award a non-competitive, sole source contract to Delta-Xray Incorporated, 2111 Wilson Blvd, STE 700, Arlington, VA 22201 for a Flash-X System. Services are being procured under FAR 13.5, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>The FBI receives evidence from joint partners and other contributing countries where the FBI is currently operating or has a working relationship to provide strategic level forensic exploitation. Before evidence is shipped to In-processing it is assumed to be certified free from explosive and rendered safe for shipment. However, the condition upon receiving can only be confirmed safe by trained personnel with proper diagnostic equipment. The FBI mission necessitates the need to have the capability to properly and precisely identify safety hazards through high-resolution radiographic means to ensure the safety of laboratory personnel seeking the maximum level of preservation of forensic evidence and institute safety/mitigation techniques to minimize safety concerns. The Flash-X System provides a high resolution real-time imaging and detailed 2D X-ray of suspected IEDs and enclosed packages with unknown contents. The Flash-X System will give the FBI the capability to properly diagnose safety concerns and take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of personnel while providing the maximum opportunity to preserve forensic evidence. This capability is crucial to provide a safe workplace environment for all FBI employees handling unverified evidence after reception.</p>
<p>Delta-Xray Incorporated is the only vendor that can provide this service to the FBI that is approved by the accrediting body of the FBI Laboratory. The Flash-X System provided by Delta-Xray Incorporated is the only system that will ensure the continued safety of FBI personnel and critical infrastructure. The Flash-X System provided by Delta-Xray Incorporated is currently the only system that will meet the requirements of the FBI. In addition, the FBI owns the Delta-Xray Flash-X System that is located in Quantico, VA. The new system will be installed at the new FBI Facility in Huntsville, AL. An Identical system must be installed in Huntsville, AL to maintain compatibility across the FBI.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to this office by 08:00 am, EST, May 26, 2015, by email to the attention of Jerry Varnell, Contract Specialist, at Jerry.Varnell@ic.fbi.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in SAM, effective July 29, 2012 to receive government contracts. The FBI uses a financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes TIN, EFT, DUNS, addresses and contact information. The EFT banking information on file in SAM will be what the FBI uses to process payment to your organization.</p>

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source contract with Biomatrica Incorporated, 5627 Oberlin Drive, STE 120, San Diego, CA 92121. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
<p><br />This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology; the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to award a non-competitive, sole source contract to Biomatrica Incorporated, 5627 Oberlin Drive, STE 120, San Diego, CA 92121 for one 10mL bottles of liquid DNAstable Plus for liquid and liquid-to-dry (LD) storage. Services are being procured under FAR 13.5, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory generates a great amount of DNA extracts that are used for validation studies. As the chemistries change, population databases need to be re-typed and updated to stay concurrent. In order to attain reliable and quality results for these updates, it is important that the samples are well preserved throughout the years.</p>
<p>There are two known products available for the purposes of stabilizing and storing DNA for long periods of time - Biomatrica and Gentegra. These two matrices were tested by the FBI DNA Support Unit to determine which, if any, would meet the requirements of the FBI.</p>
<p>The testing and validation studies revealed that the Gentegra product was not as efficient as preserving the DNA extracts compared to the Biomatrica DNAStable Plus. Although both products did preserve the samples, as the quantities of DNA were higher (closer to the expected value) on the samples treated with the matrix in comparison to those that were not; the Biomatrica DNAStable Plus provided an even higher quantity especially when dealing with low level samples.</p>
<p>The testing and validation studies demonstrated that the Biomatrica DNAStable Plus recovery was 20% higher than that of Gentegra at the three month mark indicating that a greater amount of DNA was lost when using the Gentegra matrix.</p>
<p>The Biomatrica DNAStable Plus is the only product that meets the requirements of the FBI and has been verified that it protects the preservation of the DNA and enables these samples to be stored at room temperature storage indefinitely.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>This solicitation requires registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award, pursuant to applicable regulations and guidelines.

<DESC>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA)-Southeast Regional Laboratory (SRL) has a need for a cigarette physical testing machine for the purpose of supporting new tobacco product submissions at Center for Tobacco Products.

<DESC>The DoS is installing BAS systems in New Embassy Compounds (NEC's) around the world. Currently there are 100 NEC's with BAS systems installed by a variety of third party vendors. The implementation of the BAS is providing many challenges for DoS oversight and management; examples of the challenges faced include: varied skillsets among FM's responsible for BAS operations; inconsistent power supplies at embassy compounds; varying skill levels among LES responsible for BAS oversight; limited resources for BAS support; limited vendor availability, responsiveness and support; language barriers impacting the ability to train LES responsible for BAS management; limited protocol for emergency response when BAS systems fail; lack of knowledge on how to modify BAS parameters for new space allocation or other NEC facility modifications; no best practice strategies for troubleshooting BAS problems; lack of a plan/process for upgrading BAS software that is outdated; and minimal knowledge of how manual overrides or modifications of BAS parameters impacts overall facility operations. These are in addition to the challenges related to a lack of basic BAS operational knowledge. The types of systems installed at NEC's involve, at a minimum, seven different BAS vendors as well as an undetermined number of third party contractors responsible for the system installations, support, and knowledge transfer.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-15-Q-200154 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-82 effective 7 May 2015.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopters, Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopters France (Cage Code F0210). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.</p>
<p>See attached documents titled: <br />1) Requirements - HSCG38-15-Q-200154, for a list of required parts.<br />2) Terms and Conditions - HSCG38-15-Q-200154, for applicable clauses, instructions, and evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.</p>
<p>Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p>NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED. ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>
<p>NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.</p>
<p>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 29 May 2015 at 4:15 pm EST. Anticipated award date is on or about 1 June 2015. E-mail quotations are preferred and may be sent to dawn.b.oconnor@uscg.mil. Please indicate HSCG38-15-Q-200154 in subject line. Quotations may also be mailed to the following address:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.<br />(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>
<p>52.249-1 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT<br />The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the Government's interest.

JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
523-15-3-7821-0167	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$49,403.00
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:
MapCHeck 2 Next Generation (1527 channel) 2-Dimensional real time diode array.
MapPHAN-2 (5cm)
Water equivalent phantom securely holds MapCHECK 2 array at measurement plane depth of 5cm and
backscatter depth of 5cm. Measurement may occur in the coronal and sagittal positions

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

The Radiation Therapy Department currently utilizes the MapCheck system for the Quality Assurance of each patients treatment. It is necessary to assure that each plan created for each individual patient is accurate and with in 2% of the Dr.'s prescribed dose. With this updated version we will be able to continue to QA many of the new advancements in treatment being performed here at the VA. Also, the MapPHAN is necessary to QA the MapCheck device making sure it is within the necessary specs to accurately QA patients data. 
4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
The Radiation Therapy Service has been utilizing the Sun Nuclear MapCHeck system for many years. There is a solid program set up used to maintain safe and accurate treatments to our veterans. Changing to a different QA system would cause a delay in treatments due to the need to start over a QA program with new devices and establish new data, knowledge and training. 
5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
The Physics department with in the Radiation Therapy Service has been utilizing this QA system for many years. They obtained the quote for the system. This QA system is necessary to continue the QA program set up here at the Boston VA Medical Center and maintain a high quality of treatment for each veteran.
6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-
    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
    (1) Listed end products.
Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin

    (2) __ Outside the United States.
  (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Labor Standards. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-

  (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)

The Contractor shall comply with, and in the instance of contractor/sub-contractor employees, shall ensure compliance with the following instructions when access to the Fort Leonard Wood installation/facilities are required for contract performance.  These local instructions are incorporated in this contract, in order to implement local installation antiterrorism/operations security policies and procedures, and to supplement Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.204-9, which, if applicable to this contract, is located in Section I.  In the event of conflict between any portion of this supplement and/or FAR 52.204-9; and any other provision within the SOW, PWS, or specifications; clause 52.204-9 (if listed in Section I) shall take precedence.  In the event of conflict between this supplement and any other provision within the SOW, PWS, or specifications, this supplement shall take precedence.  <br>    <br>  a. An uncleared contractor is an individual who falls into one of two categories:  (1) CAC-eligible; and (2) Non-CAC eligible.  The Common Access Card (CAC) is the DoD federal personal identity verification credential.  CAC Eligibility is defined in Army Directive 2014-05, dated March 7, 2014.  <br>    <br>   b. Army Directive 2014-05 provides that all contractor and/or subcontractor personnel who do not possess a CAC, another Federal personal identity verification card, or other authorized DoD identification card and who require unescorted access to Army installations must have a validated need for such access and undergo a vetting process to determine their fitness for access.  Accordingly, non-CAC eligible, uncleared contractor and/or sub-contractor personnel requiring access to the Fort Leonard Wood installation and facilities, to perform under this contract, will submit personal identity information through the Fort Leonard Wood Installation Pass implementation system detailed in subparagraph (1) below.  There is no charge to the Contractor or employees for this pass.  Request for pass must be submitted a minimum of ten working days prior to date access is planned.  <br>    <br>  (1) The requesting Contractor personnel and sub-contractor's personnel shall submit their requests for installation pass to their sponsor via the web based Fort Leonard Wood Installation   <br>  Pass Application IM3500 Secure Webportal, located at the following web link: https://vcc1.icmvcc.com/im3500/.   The minimum information required to complete the pass application at the Fort Leonard Wood Installation Pass Application IM3500 Secure Webportal listed in paragraph b, above, is as follows:  1. Point of Contact Email (Valid sponsor's email address).  A valid sponsor is the COR, COTR, or other Government employee designated in writing by the Contracting Officer (KO) at time of contract award, post award conference, or pre-construction conference; or the KO if no other designation is made.  2. Visitor's email address; 3. ID Number (Visitor's Driver's License Number); 4. ID Jurisdiction (State that issued the visitor driver's license); 5. Visit Start Date (The first date of visitor's visit); 6. Visit End Date (The last date of visitor's visit, not to exceed the length of the contract or one year, whichever is shorter); 7. Visitor's Name (Last name, First name, Middle name & suffix); 8. Phone Number and Address; 9. Date of Birth; 10. Eye Color; 11. Hair Color; 12. Sponsoring Organization and Applicant's Company Name.  Additionally, vehicle information may be required (Vehicle VIN Number, Plate Number, Plate Jurisdiction, Vehicle Year of Manufacture, Vehicle Make, Vehicle Model, Vehicle Color, and Vehicle Type)  <br>    <br>  (2) The information collected at this website will be used by the government to query, at a minimum, the National Crime Information Center Interstate Identification Index (NCIC-III) and the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) to determine if the person requesting unescorted access presents a potential threat to the good order, discipline, or health and safety on the installation.  Army Directive 2014-05, enclosure 2, establishes Army policy for adjudication and screening standards to control the access of unescorted uncleared contractors (contractor and subcontractor personnel) to Army installations and facilities.  <br>    <br>  (3) Uncleared contractor personnel will, in the absence of an approved waiver, be denied unescorted access to Fort Leonard Wood should the above mentioned checks contain credible derogatory information indicating that the individual may present a threat to the good order, discipline, or health and safety on the installation.  Such derogatory information includes, but is not limited to that provided within Enclosure 2, Army Directive 2014-05 (Policy and Implementation Procedures for Common Access Card Credentialing and Installation Access for Uncleared Contractors), which is available to the public at the following website:  http://www.apd.army.mil/ .  <br>    <br>  (4) Access Denial Waiver Process.  An explanation of the waiver process for individual denials of access is provided in Army Directive 2014-05.  The denial of unescorted entry onto the military installation of one or several of the contractor's or subcontractor's personnel shall not be considered an excuse for nonperformance of contract requirements.  Nor is the Government responsible for providing escorts for individuals denied unescorted access to the Installation.  <br>    <br>  c. All contractor and subcontractor personnel performing tasks on this contract shall at all times comply with applicable installation, facility and area commander installation/facility access and local security policies and procedures provided herein and otherwise provided to the Contractor by an authorized Government representative.  Contractors are warned that Installation area access control plans may require increased vigilance and restrictions on access to military installations in the case of heightened Force Protection Condition (FPCON) levels.  If task completion is hampered by temporary Government limitations on access to the Installation, the Contractor and Contracting Officer shall negotiate any extensions on delivery necessitated by emergency situations.  In addition, if heightened security requires the submission of additional security information and/or the implementation of additional security measures the Contractor shall fully cooperate with Government security procedures and requests for information.  <br>    <br>  Applicable Clauses  <br>    <br>  Section I - Contract Clauses   <br>    <br>  CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE  <br>  52.212-4 	Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items 	DEC 2014   <br>  52.219-6 	Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside 	NOV 2011   <br>  252.232-7003	Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports JUN 2012  <br>  252.232-7010	Levies on Contract Payments			DEC 2010  <br>  252.244-7000	Subcontracts for Commercial Items		JUN 2013  <br>  252.246-7000 Material Inspection and Receiving Report 		MAR 2008  <br>     <br>  CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT  <br>    <br>  52.212-5     CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS  (DEVIATION 2013-O0019) (MAR 2015)  <br>  (a) Comptroller General Examination of Record.

The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  <br>    <br>  Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command  <br>  Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel  <br>  4400 Martin Road  <br>  Rm: A6SE040.001   <br>  Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000  <br>  Fax: (256) 450-8840 or email usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil  <br>    <br>  The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at:  <br>    <br>  http://www.amc.army.mil/amc/commandcounsel.html.   <br>    <br>  If internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the HQ AMC-Level Protest Procedures.  <br>    <br>  (End of Clause)  <br>    <br>  Section K - Representations, Certifications and Other Statements of Offerors   <br>    <br>  CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE  <br>    <br>  252.209-7992 (Dev) 	Representation by Corporations Regarding an Unpaid Delinquent Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction under any Federal Law - Fiscal Year 2015 Appropriations 	DEC 2014 	   <br>     <br>  52.212-3     OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (MAR 2015)  <br>    <br>  Section L - Instructions, Conditions and Notices to Bidders   <br>    <br>  INFORMATION FOR BIDDERS  <br>    <br>  The following have been added by full text:  <br>    <br>  INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS  <br>    <br>  L-1 BIDDING ON LINE ITEMS  <br>  Bidding on all line items is required.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>See Government's Response to Questions Received below:
<p>1. Q: Is the price is to be given per Pig including health paper and inoculations, and separate price for Transportation per shipment. <br /><strong>A: Yes<br /></strong>2. Q: Is the pricing fixed or can there be adjustments based on rising costs of Gas and Swine Market. <br /><strong>A: This is a fixed price type IDIQ solicitation. IDIQs shall be awarded to all that are able to meet technical requirements. The first Delivery Order will be awarded to the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) offer. Future Delivery Orders will be competed via call/order to the IDIQ's (only) based on current market conditions and price at time of the order. <br /></strong>3. Q: Are the Pigs either sex and can they be mixed. Example Castrated males and females. There is no mention of gender in the specs. <br /><strong>A: We prefer all pigs in a shipment to be either all males (castrated) or all females. The problem being that in some instances the males will harass and stress the females especially if the ratio is skewed towards the males. A 50:50 ratio would be tolerable, but not ideal. We prefer and that we will tolerate mixed sexes as long as the females are not radically outnumbered.</strong></p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.(c) Special rules. <BR> <BR>The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><strong>This modification is issued to advise the RFP is now available on DIBBs at&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP/">https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP/</a>.&nbsp; The RFP is scheduled to close on June 22, 2015. <br /><br /></strong><br /><br />NSNs &amp; Item Descriptions: See Spreadsheet
<p>Quantity Estimates (Yearly): See Spreadsheet</p>
<p>Unit of Issue: See Spreadsheet</p>
<p>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will issue a Request for Proposal on or about May 15, 2015 at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFP is to solicit proposals for supply chain management of the Water Purification Systems Initiative (WPS) for the Department of Defense. This approach includes the supply chain management of 2639 NSNs. This program is designed to provide the supply, storage and distribution for multiple Federal Supply Classes for this program. This program is intended to create a supply support program for worldwide demands for WPS customers. The Government is looking to take advantage of the latest technologies, expertise, and business practices, which translate into improved support to customers at less cost.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.</p>
<p>The resultant contract will be awarded on an all or none basis and is being solicited as 100% Small Business Set Aside. This acquisition will use a Long-Term Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Quantity contract, five year base period with Annual Price Adjustment provisions. This solicitation includes an Add/Delete clause which allows the Government to adapt the resultant contract to the changing needs of the military customer. Award will be made using Tradeoff Source Selection Procedures with Technical and Price as the evaluation factors.</p>
<p>The Government will use a "Market Basket" pricing methodology to evaluate prices for an award. The market basket will consist of 903 of the 2639 NSNs synopsized, which will form the core priced items in CLIN 0001, and of the 903 core NSNs, those for which the prices are determined to be fair and reasonable will be activated for purchase at the time of award. The CLIN 0001 NSNs are deemed to be a combination of the highest demand items and randomly selected NSNs that have had past demands, and represent 99% percent of the anticipated dollar value of the planned acquisition. Offerors are required to submit pricing for the 903 core NSNs under CLIN 0001 on an all or none basis prior to the solicitation closing.</p>

<p>The RFP is in its final stages of review. The government estimates that it will issue the formal RFP sometime within the next 30 days and receipt of proposals approximately 60 days after issuance. This timeline is being provided as an estimate and not a guarantee that the RFP will be issued during that time.</p>

<p>his announcement is issued for informational and planning purposes only. This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this announcement or otherwise pay for the information solicited. Responses to this announcement will not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>The R1S PMO appreciates the efforts and interests of industry for the procurement of the next generation recreation services contract and we would like to update you on changes for the procurement and our milestones.</p>
<p>Attached to this announcement is the DRAFT version of the RFP. The Government is requesting that any comments be directed to Jason King by email to jasonmking@fs.fed.us no later than October 22, 2014. Please note that questions may or may not be answered. If questions are answered, they will be posted to FedBizOps in an announcement. Questions must be submitted via the attached R1S Draft RFP QA Template. The draft RFP is being posted to gauge the response of industry and to incorporate feedback and questions received from this post and will form a basis for the final version of the RFP.</p>
<p>Please note, there are 23 attachments to this announcement. Please ensure you download all attachments as each one is required.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Government's Recreation Information Database (RIDB) has recently been enhanced to include detailed information down to the site level for both reservable and non-reservable federal recreation inventory. Interested parties are highly encouraged to download the RIDB data from http://ridb.recreation.gov/ as this dataset is highly representative of the dataset which the Government will provide to the successful R1SSS offeror upon contract award.</p>
<p>At the current time, we do not have an updated milestone schedule for the release of the final version of the RFP. As this information is developed, we will post a follow up announcement to FedBizOps to update all interested parties. Until that posting is made, there is no further information the Government would be able to share.</p>

<DESC><p><strong><br />* SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE*<br /><br />INTRODUCTION:</strong><br /><br />The Division of Acquisition Policy (DAP) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Indian Health Service (IHS) wants to identify viable small businesses and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) owned businesses that can provide the IHS Division of Diabetes Treatment and Prevention (DDTP) a broad range of experts and professional staff to conduct essential and ongoing programmatic work related to: <br /><br />1) the organization and successful operations of the DDTP national network and DDTP meetings and workgroups; <br />2) coordination, review, and evaluation of AI/AN clinical and public health programs; <br />3) translation of diabetes research to information and resources for clinical practice; <br />4) dissemination of evidence based information and resources; and <br />5) project management services. While these functions are critical to the success of DDTP programs, they are not inherently federal functions.<br /><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><br />This is a Small Business and AI/AN owned Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: <br />(1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; <br />(2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses;<br />(3) AI/AN owned businesses; and <br />(4) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.&nbsp;<br /></span><br /><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong><br /><br />The mission of the Indian Health Service (IHS), Division of Diabetes Treatment and Prevention (DDTP) is to develop, document, and sustain a public health effort to prevent and control diabetes and related chronic diseases in America Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people and communities. The DDTP employs collaborative strategies in the 12 IHS Areas through coordination of a network of Area Diabetes Consultants, and approximately 500 Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) grant programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In addition, the DDTP is the primary point of contact for inter-agency as well as intra-agency communication on the prevention and treatment of diabetes and related chronic diseases in AI/AN communities.<br /><br />The SDPI program was initially established and authorized by Congress through the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>It has since been augmented and reauthorized, extending it through 2015.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Currently funded at $150 million per year, DDTP has only two permanent professional federal employees to administer all of the SDPI grant programs, including coordinating and implementing the entire competitive grant application process for FY 2016.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>As a result of this shortage in federal staffing, as well as the necessity of continuing work on this and other mission critical national projects, including the First Lady's "Let's Move! In Indian Country" (LMIC) initiative, the DDTP is in need of a cadre of professionals with experience in working with AI/AN communities to provide expertise in biostatistics, medical review, data analysis, communications, medical nutrition therapy, program review and evaluation, federal grants management, web site development and design, project management, and writing and editing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; <br /></span><br />This contract will support IHS DDTP program activities and initiatives by providing professional expertise and management of the tasks that will be detailed in the scope of work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>It will require as many as 20 to 30 specialists that can provide services for varying amounts of time throughout the year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The quality, quantity, and timeliness of performed services will make a significant impact on the DDTP mission and overall program performance and will ultimately affect key stakeholders that include IHS leadership and IHS/Tribal/Urban (I/T/U) healthcare programs nationwide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This contract will be for five periods, a base period and four option periods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The contract type is intended to be a Firm-Fixed price. <br /><br />The Dissemination of Information and Resources tasks are focused on continued development and utilization of the IHS DDTP website as the primary platform for dissemination of information and resources for clinical staff and SDPI grantees. This also includes continued provision of virtual trainings (DDTP, Audit, SDPI Grant, LMIC, and Clinical) as a key venue for dissemination of information and resources for clinical staff and SDPI grantees.<br /><br />At present, services are being provided under a current IHS contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>A new contract needs to be in place by the current contract expiration date with staff that has the professional expertise and experience needed to immediately provide the necessary services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This will ensure absolute continuity and avoid disruption of services to the SDPI grant programs throughout the nation along with critical projects that are already underway.</p>

<DESC>W9133L-15-R-0084  <br>  Attachment:  Performance Work Statement (PWS) May 2015  <br>  NAICS: 541620  <br>  Synopsis:  <br>  The Air National Guard (ANG) provides support to the States, the United States Air Force, and the Department of Defense. The ANG is task oriented to provide support within specific areas of expertise, and occasionally uses contractors to assist with these efforts. Significant increases in occupational health, environmental and bioterrorism threat requirements for ANG units and members have occurred throughout the world since Sept 11, 2001, with the subsequent national defense efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Federal and State regulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and others have also increased dramatically. This is concurrent with ANG's ongoing mission of maintaining daily operations and satisfying the need of the state and nation in a timely and efficient manner.  Support and environmental evaluation services for expanded occupational and environmental health requirements on ANG bases requires expertise to maintain strict compliance standards required to maintain continuity and legality of operations. Service applications and overhead associated with meeting these requirements at a national level requires specialized analysis and advanced services in industrial hygiene and occupational surveillance to assess and maintain strict adherence to numerous Congressional and State mandated standards from various agencies including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the Nuclear Regulation Commission (NRC) and other federal agencies the State regulatory agencies, DOD, AF and installation mandates. Assessment includes assistance in the formulation of responses and dispositions of individual units as well as making recommendations for the Guard's development of policies that support the decisions which are ultimately made by a military director.  <br>    <br>  The Contractor shall be required to provide the following key personnel: Industrial and Environmental Analytics Program Director and Services Coordinator; Regional Level Industrial Hygiene and Environmental Analytics.  <br>  Place of Performance: Performance will take place on Government installations, or at other approved locations, as designated by the National Guard Bureau Office of the Command Surgeon (NGB/SG) Contracting Officer Representative.

Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partner.  <br>  Capability Packages should clearly address the following:  <br>  A technical understanding of objective of this requirement to implement a standardized, centrally managed, cost-effective program designed to meet or exceed preventive and corrective maintenance requirements for all Advantor Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and all Advantor PL-1 to Pl-3, DCID 6/9 and JAFAN 6/9 EECS at ANG Bases.  <br>  Key Personnel:  Does key personnel have previous experience in schedule administration for a similar Industrial and Environmental Analytics Service project?  <br>    <br>  Past Performance:  Does the company have past performance for a similar Industrial and Environmental Analytics Service project?  <br>  In addition, the following questions must be answered and elaborated on as part of the package:  <br>  (1) Past Performance - Describe your firms relevant past performance experience within the last three years of schedule administration for an Industrial and Environmental Analytics Service project or a similar project.  <br>  (2) Corporate Experience - Describe your firms work experience similar in nature, scope, complexity, value and difficulty of work in schedule administration for an Industrial and Environmental Analytics Service project or a similar project.  <br>  (3) Company size (number of employees)?  <br>  (4) Company size (annual revenue)?  <br>  (5) Describe your firm's partnerships/teaming capabilities that would enable you to perform the objectives of this requirement.  <br>  Additional information regarding this requirement will be posted for viewing on FedBizOps at https://www.fbo.gov/ as it become available.

<DESC>This requirement will be processed under FAR Part 13.5 procedures.  The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price, sole source contract to Carahsoft Technology Corporation for the reinstatement and renewal of 1,190 VMWare Horizon View licenses, for the Center for Information Dominance (CID).  The resulting contract will have one base year and one (1) six month option period under the NAICS code of 511210.  This office will no longer issue a hard copy of the Request for Quote (RFQ); therefore, a copy can be obtained from website http://www.neco.navy.mil.  By submitting an offer, the vendor is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency.
  Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the offer.  By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this RFQ, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States.  Lack of registration in the SAM database will make a contractor ineligible for award. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at https://www.bpn.gov.  The solicitation will contain the clause FAR 52.217-8, and the prices under this clause will be evaluated prior to award.
 The RFQ will be posted on or before 29 May 2015.

Please note important changes in Section 5.0 in regards to the use of support contractors during one-on-one sessions.  Amendment A0001  This amendment updates previous language under the RFI and removes "Leidos" from the list of support contractors that will be providing administrative support throughout the RFI process. Section 4.2 of the RFI has been updated accordingly. All other items, including response time remain unchanged.  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) in support of the Program Executive Office Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (PEO C4I) Program Manager, Warfare (PMW) 120, Battlespace Awareness and Information Operations, is seeking industry feedback on innovative approaches to address  knowledge, skill, and capability gaps in the Government-led Systems Integration effort for Distributed Common Ground System  Navy Increment 2 (DCGS-N Inc 2).  The goal is, as a team, to define DCGS-N Inc 2 acquisition and engineering strategies.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. The Government will not formally evaluate or provide feedback as to the RFI responses.  This RFI does not commit the Government to a contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Navy is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will Not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs incurred or associated with responding to this notice will solely be at the respondents expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fbo.gov and the SPAWAR E- Commerce Central website at https://e- commerce.sscno.nmci.navy.mil.  It is the responsibility of the potential respondents to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  DCGS-N is the Navy service component of the Department of Defense (DoD) DCGS Family of Systems (FoS) which provides integration of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Targeting (ISR&T) support capabilities afloat and ashore in support of Navy and Joint operations.  DCGS-N Inc 2 will shorten targeting timelines and improve information fidelity by providing real-time automated aggregation, correlation, and fusion of all source intelligence and near real-time analysis of activities to produce predictive situational awareness, allowing earlier identification of enemy threat and intent.  PMW 120 will host an Industry Day on 05 May 2015 at the Handlery Hotel, 950 Hotel Circle N, San Diego, CA 92108. The purpose of the Industry Day is to update industry on the DCGS-N Inc 2 program and provide a sense of what technologies, capabilities, and services are most needed for the Navy to achieve its goals.  A brief will be presented to industry on 05 May 2015 at the Handlery Hotel.  Following the briefing, the Government may consider hosting one-on-one sessions with interested attendees dependent upon industry interest.  If one- on-one sessions are to be held, the sessions will begin after the program briefing and continue through 07 May 2015. Additional information on location, schedule, and registration details can be found at https://einvitations.afit.edu/inv/anim.cfm?i=236520&k=0062440C7957.  Registration to industry day and the one-on-one sessions is required by no later than 4:00 PM PST on 21 April 2015.   Registration to attend the Industry Day is required due to space limitations. Attendance for both sessions is limited to two attendees per CAGE code.  The purpose of the one-on-one sessions, if held at the Governments discretion, is to provide Industry the opportunity to share information it may not feel is appropriate to share in a public setting with other Industry present.  Note, the Government will be in receive mode only, and not entertain unsolicited proposals or provide additional information about DCGS-N Inc. 2 requirements that has not already been disclosed in the public Industry Day forum.  If the Government determines as a result of the one-on-one sessions that Industry could benefit from additional information, it will post such information publicly to SPAWAR e-Commerce Central prior to the close of the RFI.

<a href="mailto:kathleen.d.henderson2.civ@mail.mil">Center for Health Care Contracting</a>
<DESC>This is a modification to the pre-solicitation notice posted on 18 August 2014.  <br> This a Request for Proposal (RFP)/Solicitation to provide non-personal, healthcare housekeeping services in support of United States Army Medical Department (USAMEDDAC), Fort Meade, MD.  The Center for Health Care Contracting (CHCC) intends to procure the necessary healthcare housekeeping and related services in support of multiple Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the health service area of USAMEDDAC, Fort Meade, MD.  USAMEDDAC Fort Meade includes MTFs located in Fort Meade, MD; Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), MD; Fort Detrick, MD; and Joint Base Henderson Hall (JBHH)-, Fort Myer, VA and JBHH-McNair, DC. This acquisition is solicited as an 8(a) set-aside under other than full and open competition in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.204(a). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this solicitation is 561720. This solicitation will be awarded using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable evaluation criteria. The agency proposes to award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under which Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders for healthcare housekeeping services will be issued. An IDIQ contract is the optimum contract type for this effort as an exact quantity and/or appropriate categorization of services (Type Ill, IV, V, etc.) cannot be determined on a MTF-specific, individual room basis at the time of contract award.  The resultant FFP task orders issued against the IDIQ will clearly describe USAMEDDAC, Fort Meade MTF-specific healthcare housekeeping requirements and services to be performed and provide for prices that will not be subject to any adjustment on the basis of the 8(a) contractor's cost experience in performing this contract. All services shall be firm-fixed price and subject to the Service Contract Act (41 U.S.C. 351). The solicitation and subsequent contract will include contract line items (CLINS) with 5-year ordering periods.  The anticipated IDIQ contract will obligate the government to the minimum guarantee of $1,500.00 for post-award conference. The entire amount of the minimum guarantee will be obligated against FY 15 funds.  Further obligations will arise as task orders are awarded and obligations will be charged to the fiscal year in which the order is placed.  Healthcare housekeeping services are required for 60 months starting 1 March 2015 through 29 February 2020.  All elements of the RFP shall be submitted by the Offeror with a proposal no later than the date/time shown in block 8 of the Standard Form (SF) 1449, Solicitation/Contract Order for Commercial Items. The square feet (SF) for cleaning of each MTF is varied; however, the estimated SF for USA MEDDAC MTFs is 349,885 SF.   <br>  <br> This solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The official access point to the solicitation is via the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi.   The primary point of contact for this project is Ms. Viola Muniz, Contract Specialist, (210) 221-5722; email viola.muniz.civ@mail.mil. The secondary point of contact is Ms. Kathleen Henderson, Contracting Officer, (210) 295-4346; email kathleen.d.henderson2.civ@mail.mil. A pre-proposal conference and site visit is tentatively scheduled for 15 - 16 October 2014.

<p>(4) Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition 6.302-2 -- Unusual and Compelling Urgency 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2)</p>
<p>(5) Given the unusual and compelling urgency of the HPAI outbreak contractors were chosen based on their ability to supply the necessary supplies or services in the timeframes allotted.</p>
<p>(6) In as many situations as possible multiple quotes were requested in writing or orally following FAR 13 procedures and an exception to the subpart 5.2 exists under 5.202 (a)(2)</p>
<p>"The proposed contract action is made under the conditions described in 6.302-2 (or, for purchases conducted using simplified acquisition procedures, if unusual and compelling urgency precludes competition to the maximum extent practicable) and the Government would be seriously injured if the agency complies with the time periods specified in 5.203"</p>
<p>(7) Fair and reasonable determinations were made for each procurement based on market research, comparison with other Government procurements, multiple quotes, contracting officer or program personnel knowledge.</p>
<p>(8) Market research is occurring on a continuous basis through the following methods:</p>
<p>(i) Contacting knowledgeable individuals in Government and industry regarding market capabilities to meet requirements.<br />(ii) Reviewing the results of recent market research undertaken to meet similar or identical requirements.<br />(iii) Querying the Government wide database of contracts and other procurement instruments intended for use by multiple agencies.<br />(iv) Participating in interactive, on-line communication among industry, acquisition personnel, and customers.<br />(v) Obtaining source lists of similar items from other contracting activities or agencies, trade associations or other sources.<br />(vi) Reviewing catalogs and other generally available product literature published by manufacturers, distributors, and dealers or available on-line.<br />(vii) Conducting meetings and holding conferences with potential offerors early in the acquisition process<br />(viii) Use of local SBA and PTAC offices</p>
<p>(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:</p>
<p>The urgent and compelling nature of these procurements involve depopulating and disposing of HPAI infected flocks. In order to minimize the chance of the disease spreading these activities must occur as quickly as possible to minimize the economic disruption estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>(10) Various sources have expressed interest in the tasks associated with this effort. When possible quotes have been solicited from these companies to increase competition.</p>
<p>(11) APHIS is requesting quotes from as many companies as possible. As the emergency slows down we are in the process of getting FBO.gov notices seeking companies that perform the work necessary so we can have a list of qualified vendors. There is a discussion on getting some longer term contracts in place over the next year in the even this (or a similar) outbreak occurs again. To the maximum extent possible we are using existing USDA contracts and small business.</p>
<p>(12) This justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Approved:<br />Larry Nelson<br />USDA APHIS Contracting Officer and Competition Advocate.</p>

<DESC>The contractor shall provide support services directly related to federal background investigation processing. Background investigation support has the following major components: receipt, screening, data entry, case file maintenance and post-closing support. The contractor is required to provide all assigned support services needed to process and ensure the quality of all products provided by OPM to its customers. OPM intends to enter into negotiations, using electronic commerce, with only one source for a modification to an existing contract no sooner than fifteen (15) days following posting of this synopsis. Said negotiations for additional services shall be finalized prior to expiration of the existing contract and shall be for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months that will end prior to October 1, 2016. See Item 14 for existing contract award date information. OPM shall issue a competitive solicitation sometime thereafter for the subject support services that is currently scheduled to be awarded prior to October 1, 2016 and will be available via GPE. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by OPM as part of its on-going market research efforts. This synopsis is for the anticipated modification to an existing contract award only. The sole source that OPM intends to negotiate with for this action using the authority of FAR 6.302-1 is Next Tier Concepts of Vienna, Va. A modification to an existing contract with said vendor shall result from this synopsis and the request for proposal shall not be made available to other parties. OPM's background investigations program is critical to national security of the United States. In order to maintain the integrity of the program we must extend the current background investigations support services contract with NT Concepts for one (1) additional year of performance. Maintaining the contract with the existing vendor is the only way that OPM can avoid a debilitating transition. Transitioning to a new vendor at this critical and challenging time would unreasonably jeopardize OPM's ability to meet its mission. This notice is published in accordance with FAR 5.203. OPM will publish the approved justification in accordance with FAR 6.305 after the final modification is executed.
