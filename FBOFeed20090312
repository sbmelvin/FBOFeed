<DESC>Boa Prescription Burn Project,
NEPA Categorical Exclusion Process
A.  Introduction
This performance-based Work Statement defines the effort required to secure professional services to manage an Inter-disciplinary Team (IDT), conduct environmental analysis and public involvement, and prepare a Decision Memo for a project to reduce fire hazard on the San Bernardino National Forest, Front Country Ranger District near Lytle Creek and Keenbrook California. The project will be analyzed using Forest Service Categorical Exclusion FSH 1909.15, 31.2 (6) in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
Background:
The Boa Burn is located in an area classified as Wildland-Urban-Interface by the San Bernardino National Forest. Under the National Fire Plan and the Healthy Forest Initiative, emphasis is placed on reducing the risk of wildfire within the urban interface around communities at risk. The area is 834 acres in size.  
The suppression of low intensity fires  for the past 100 years has resulted in a forest condition where the vegetation is denser, ladder fuels are abundant,  and there are accumulations of woody material. Some parts of the project area are exceeding the carrying capacity resulting in vegetation mortality. In addition, the San Bernardino National Forest has experienced drought in recent years, the effects of which are still evident.  A drought is a natural phenomenon; however, when vegetation density exceeds the carrying capacity, many trees and shrubs are unable to withstand drought conditions.  This leads to plant mortality resulting in the current forest conditions with high levels of fuel loading.   
Project Location
The Boa Prescription Burn Project is located in between the communities of Lytle Creek and Keenbrook in the San Bernardino National Forest, San Bernardino County, California.  The project lies on the Lower Lytle Creek Ridge, on an east facing slope, in T2N, R6W, Sections 11, 14, 23, and 24.  
The solicitation will be available for downloading on this site on or about March 30, 2009.

<DESC>Santa Ana Hazardous Fuels Reduction Project, Environmental Assessment Process
A.  Introduction
This performance-based Work Statement defines the effort required to secure professional services to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) for a hazardous fuels reduction project on the San Bernardino National Forest, Front Country Ranger District, Lytle Creek, California. This project will be performed under the authority of, and must comply with, the Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA).
Background:  
The Santa Ana project area is located in an area classified as Wildland-Urban-Interface by the San Bernardino National Forest.  Under the National Fire Plan and the Healthy Forest Initiative, emphasis is placed on reducing the risk of wildfire within the urban interface around communities at risk. The Front Country Ranger District of the San Bernardino National Forest proposes to redevelop the Santa Ana Fuelbreak. This fuelbreak lies in between the San Bernardino foothill communities of Highland and Mentone to the south, and the Mountain communities of Skyforest, Running Springs, and Arrowbear to the north.  Total population to be protected is 109621 (2005 census data).  Number of Housing units to be protected is 35860 (2005 Census data). 
The current state of the fire break needs repair due to the lack of recent thinning and fires has resulted in a forest condition where the vegetation is denser, ladder fuels are present, and there are unnaturally-high levels of woody material in some parts of the project area. In addition, the San Bernardino National Forest has experienced an extreme drought in recent years, the effects of which are still evident.  A drought is a natural phenomenon; however, when vegetation is unnaturally dense, many trees and shrubs are unable to withstand drought conditions.  This leads to tree and shrub mortality resulting in the current forest conditions with unnaturally high levels of fuel loading. Trees, stressed due to the lack of moisture, are also being killed by insects and diseases.  Countless trees died as a result of drought and drought-related stresses.
Project Location
The project area is located along an existing fuelbreak, which lies between the San Bernardino foothill communities of Highland and Mentone to the south, and the Mountain communities of Skyforest, Running Springs, and Arrowbear to the north.  Fuelbreak parallels Forest Road 1N09 east of Highway 330.  The projects’ legal description is T1N, R1W sections 8, 16,17,18, and T1N, R2W sections 8, 13,14,15,16,17,18, 20, 22, 24 and T1N, R3W sections 10,11,12,13,14. The proposed project study area is approximately 1992 acres.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation, has a requirement for research focused on human genetic variations that correlate with inter-individual differences in the immune response to infection by, or vaccination against, one or more emerging or re-emerging infectious human pathogens.

This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) solicits proposals for research that will replicate previously identified human genotype-phenotype associations. Proposed work will focus on the human immune response to infection by, or vaccination against, one or more of the emerging or re-emerging Group I, II, or III infectious agents listed at http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/emerging/list.htm. Proposals will describe the results of prior work that has already identified such genotype-phenotype associations, and describe an experimental approach to replicate those results in an independent population(s). Proposals will also include studies to elucidate the functional relevance of the validated genetic variants that correlate with immune outcome.

The initial discovery of a genetic association with a particular phenotype is generally not sufficient to establish a meaningful genotype-phenotype correlation. Replication studies in populations similar to those used in the discovery phase are needed to minimize false calls and confirm the initial findings, even when strong putative associations were initially found. In addition, replication studies performed with populations that differ from the initial study may provide important information on the generality of the association and might also assist in narrowing a large genetic interval of interest. Additional genotyping is often required to narrow a sequence interval and identify the specific genetic element responsible for the effect on phenotype. Biological studies may provide an alternate or complementary approach to defining the specific locus involved and confirming association, and may also help determine the mechanism of action. Rigorous statistical thresholds and methods of analysis are essential components of the experimental design in these studies, as are sufficient sample sizes and capacities for data collection, management, analysis, and data storage.

This program will help establish convincing associations between genotypes and susceptibility to infectious disease or responsiveness to vaccination. This information will help to identify individual risk factors, will expand our understanding of immune mechanisms applicable to a broad range of human diseases, and will help define biomarkers of risk and immunity that might lead to novel diagnostic tests of infection or vaccine response. 

Proposals will be evaluated against the following criteria: scientific and technical merit; scientific and technical personnel; organizational capability and experience; and facilities, equipment, and other resources.

It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a five-year period of performance beginning on or about June 1, 2010.    

The NIAID estimates that the average annual total cost (direct and indirect costs combined) is $8 million available for the entire project.  However, it is anticipated that the total cost for the award(s) may vary depending upon the scope of the project and the technical objectives of the award(s). The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research. In no event shall the period of performance proposed by an offeror exceed five years.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency. This BAA will be available electronically on/about March 30, 2009, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

Minsi repeater boundary area, Warren County, New Jersey.
General Statement of Work
Furnish all labor and equipment to thin and chip thick vegetation, and to thin and limb tree stands. The predominant species are eastern white pine, oaks, maples, autumn olive, eastern hemlock, eastern red cedar. All of the brush within 100 feet of the park boundary is to be cut, chipped, mowed, and/or scattered in the area.  The boundary of the area to be treated will be flagged by the NPS (flagging color to be determined). Remaining stumps are to be cut flush with the ground.  The COTR may direct the contractor to cut and chip other vegetation as deemed necessary. All trees, with the exception of eastern hemlock, less than 5 inches DBH within 100 feet of the park boundary will be felled.  All felled trees will be limbed.  All limbs generated on the project will be chipped and chips scattered in the area. Tree trunks and other materials generated on the project will be bucked into approximately 10 foot sections or less and scattered so as to be in contact with the ground if not chipped.  The COR may direct which trees to leave or fall. All trees greater than 5 inches DBH will be limbed to not less than approximately 6 feet above ground and any dead limbs, 1 inch or greater in diameter at the point of attachment to the trunk, will be removed. Any trees that are already on the ground not as a result of the contractor's operation are to be limbed, bucked, and/or chipped.  Tree trunks and other materials greater than 6 inches in diameter will be bucked into approximately 10 foot sections or less and scattered so as to be in contact with the ground if not chipped. Access to the trees is limited by rough terrain, dense vegetation, and lack of access points.  Dragging of limb parts to a chipper may be necessary.  Vehicle and equipment access within and around the stand will be as approved by the COR.  No work will be done within 50 feet of a lake, pond, or wetland unless otherwise directed by the COR.  These areas have been identified on the attached map and may be flagged by the NPS (flagging color to be determined).
AUTHORITY:  All work performed on this project shall conform to professional arborist standards.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill because scientists at the University in the Atomic Absorption Spectrometry Laboratory in the Clinical Nutrition Research Center have a unique procedure (pre-analysis reduction of samples with L-cysteine) that permits oxidation-state specific measurement of individual arsenicals in biological samples and is unique in utilizing a multiple microflame quartz tube atomizer (multiatomizer) as a component of the atomic absorption spectrometer for detection of arsenical species separated by hydride generation-cryotrapping-gas chromatography. The EPA requires measurement of inorganic and methylated arsenicals in biological samples using generation-cryotrapping to support an ongoing study of the disposition and metabolism of arsenicals in organisms.Since this technique is not available in any other laboratory EPA believes this is the only vendor capable of satisfying this requirement. The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement and provide pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible. Consequently, anyone failing to provide the aforementioned and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the statement of work or more information about the project will be ignored.  Please submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Jeffery Clodfelter (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This competitive combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items is prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Solicitation No. DTRT57-09-Q-80046 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13.5 and FAR Part 12. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-30.  The NAICS Code is 922160.  The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order on a competitive basis.  This is a Small Business Set-Aside.  The John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) has a requirement to purchase 280 Fire Extinguishers in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW) below. 
STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)--(BEGIN)
The Volpe Center, wishes to purchase 250 portable fire extinguishers and an additional 30 extinguishers to comply with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 10 for Buildings 1 through 6.  The Contractor shall provide services in accordance with the requirements, schedules, guidance, and information contained or referenced herein for the project listed below:
PROJECT TITLE: PORTABLE FIRE EXTINGUISHERS FOR BUILDINGS 1 THROUGH 6PROJECT LOCATION:  JOHN A. VOLPE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS CENTER CAMBRIDGE, MA. 02142
Government points of contact for this project are:
Mr. Bill Ng, Facility Engineer
For purposes of coordinating site visits and obtaining site data and record drawings contact Ms. Karen Marino, Buyer, at (617) 494-2437. Hours of Operation The Volpe Center is open from 6:30 AM to 3:00 PM Monday through Friday.  These hours constitute normal working hours.  The work in this contract should be performed during normal working hours. Drawings There are no sketches or drawings accompanying this package.  
Scope of Work
The Volpe Center has completed their annual portable fire extinguisher (PFE) inspection.
The Volpe Center is comprised of 6 Buildings:
Building 1 has a total of 123 extinguishersBuilding 2 has a total of 15 extinguishersBuilding 3 has a total of 56 extinguishersBuilding 4 has a total of 29 extinguishersBuilding 5 has a total of 5 extinguishersBuilding 6 has a total of 22 extinguishers
Total 250 portable fire extinguishers (PFE) were inspected.
Upon inspection, 2 ? 10lb ABC extinguishers will require 6 year maintenance, 108 - 10lb ABC extinguishers require hydro testing and refill along with valves and o-rings.  After reviewing the final report, the Volpe Center would need to service the final 140 PFE in the next several years. 
The Volpe Center desires to purchase 250 new PFE rather than servicing the 110 PFE that need service and the140 PFE which will require service in the next few years.  This approach would provide the Volpe Center with a base-line throughout the Volpe Center Campus, thus eliminating the need to swap out PFE every year.  With this approach the Volpe Center will have PFE for the next 6 years, with only inspection every year.  The contractor shall remove all existing PFE at the Volpe Center and install all new PFE with the appropriate inspection certificates.  
The contractor must be able to read the exiting bar code for each PFE and provide a report of its location and present condition.  The existing bar code format is 3 of 9 with a minimum of 8 digits that comprise a unique serial identifier within the Web-based Reporting System.  The report shall be downloadable in rich text format or Microsoft Word.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to issue a solicitation for system and technical support for its Performance Accountability and Standards System (PASS).  TSA is required by the Aviation Transportation Security Act, Public Law 107-71 (ATSA) to conduct an Annual Proficiency Review (APR) of all Transportation Security Officers. The specific requirements are:

“The Under Secretary shall provide that an annual evaluation of each individual who is assigned screening duties is conducted and documented. An individual employed as a security Screener may not continue to be employed in that capacity unless the evaluation demonstrates that the individual:

A. Continues to meet all qualifications and standards required to perform a screening function;
B. Has a satisfactory record of performance and attention to duty based on the standards     and requirements in the security program; and
C. Demonstrates the current knowledge and skills necessary to courteously, vigilantly, and effectively perform screening functions.”

The Performance Accountability and Standards System (PASS) is the program by which TSA complies with ATSA.  TSA intends to issue a solicitation for system and overall support for the PASS program.  This requirement involves developing an end-to-end, pay-for-performance Performance Management Program (PMP), to include all complementary infrastructure and logistical support services, to ensure TSA’s approximately 45,000 Transportation Security Officers and Transportation Security Managers complete their legislatively required APR.  

The system component (currently called PASS Online) includes:

o Creating a Scoring Logic application for calculating the final rating of TSA workforce with input from the PMP Database and Online Learning Center (OLC).
o Creating, updating, and maintaining the PMP Online system as a web-based application to present and report on data from the PMP Database.
o Providing standard and ad-hoc reporting functionality for Program Office and airports.
o Providing a Help Desk for system-related technical support and “first-response” programmatic support to employees, supervisors, managers, rating officials, and system administrators.
o Providing Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) of the evaluation process at the airports.

The Overall Support services to support the PMP include:
o Providing Program Management and reporting to support the PMP objectives. 
o Providing general performance management training to TSA field representatives and airport management.
o Developing employee and rating official training curriculum for packaging and deployment on TSA’s online learning platform.
o Developing PMP scenario-based evaluator train-the-trainer certification and evaluation.
o Developing annual performance evaluation certification and training curriculum development, packaging, and delivery for train-the-trainer evaluators.
o Packaging evaluation certification and training curriculum development for train-the-trainer delivery at the airport level.
o Developing PMP Evaluation Tools:
o Creating assessment and evaluation tools to support proficiency testing for TSA positions covered under PMP.
o Maintaining all assessment and evaluation tools (e.g., scenario-based checklists).
o Piloting PMP assessments to designated airports prior to full scale roll out.

o Providing Logistical Support:
o Coordinating and distributing Government Furnished Equipment to airports.
o Maintaining all scenario-based checklists.
o Maintaining the scenario-based checklist evaluation master schedule
o Maintaining, replenishing, and replacing scenario Test Kits (i.e., evaluation props to conduct assessments).
o Supporting the scenario-based evaluation process.
o Providing IV&V of the scenario-based evaluation process:
o Supporting TSA’s quality control evaluations of the annual PMP and infrastructure support services via on-site airport visits.

The applicable NAICS code is 541511 and the business size standard is $25.0 million.  This acquisition will be solicited as an 8a competitive.  A formal Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 1 April 2009 via Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at http://www.fbo.gov.  Paper copies of the solicitation will not be mailed.  Prospective offerors are responsible for checking FBO to obtain the solicitation and any amendments or other information pertaining to the solicitation.  The period of performance is estimated to be sixty months.  There will be a 4 month transition period with one base period consisting of 8 months and four-12 month option periods.

<DESC>The Government intends to procure a follow-on contract with Digital Fusion Solutions, Incorporated (DFSI) based on previous efforts performed by DFSI for a variant transport system to be included within the existing Non-Line of Sight Launch System (NLOS-LS) cache of missile systems, namely the NLOS-T.  NLOS-T is designed as a cargo round and to fit within the geometry of the NLOS-LS Container Launch Unit (C/LU).  This contract will further prototype work for NLOS-T through integration and testing of the baseline carrier design as well as integration, testing and demonstration of new payloads that the NLOS-T will carry during the demonstration phase.<BR><BR>The purpose of this effort is to continue component performance characterizations, predictive performance modeling and simulation, and detailed design and analysis of the prototype hardware, software and control algorithms.  A full scale wind tunnel model of the selected airframe design will be evaluated in the wind tunnel with the results confirming the performance predicted from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis.  This contract will further prototype work for NLOS-T through integration and testing of the baseline carrier design as well as integration, testing and demonstration of new payloads that the NLOS-T will carry.  It will include dynamic test, slug tests and hardware in the loop (HWIL) lab testing of components and subsystems.  <BR><BR>This follow-on contract is sole sourced to Digitial Fusion Solutions, Incorporated, 5030 Bradford Dr., Bldg. 1 Ste 210, Huntsville, AL 35805.  No other contractor has or can be made to have the essential qualifications to meet the Governments requirements without substantial duplication of costs that is not expected to be recovered through competition. DFSI possesses unique technical attributes necessary to satisfy this requirement for technical design, fabrication and testing of the NLOS-T concept developed from their past efforts on the program.  DFSI also employs subject matter experts in key technology areas applicable to defense systems and more specifically, Army tactical missile systems.  That subject matter expertise, which was the basis for the initial selection for the program, has continued to grow with their progress on the NLOS-T program and keeps DFSI uniquely qualified to execute the NLOS-T program.  <BR><BR>Performance for the resulting cost plus fixed fee contract will include an initial effort and four 12-month option periods in FY10 through FY13 and an option period in FY14 not to exceed 60 months.    <BR><BR>To request a copy of this solicitation please e-mail karen.jean.jones@us.army.mil.  All responsible sources may submit an offer that shall be considered by the agency.  See numbered note 22.<BR><BR>

<p>Project 01, Install Duplicate Electrical feed to Museum of the Air Force, Area B. Install cable, duct, and padmount switches to create new feed to existing loop circuits serving Museum of the Air Force and The Prairies. Load growth at these sites will cause the existing 250 kcmil cable to be insufficient to serve both loads if one side of the loop fails. Due to the long length of cable feeding these sites, repairs could take 1-3 days, and there is too much load to be restored by portable generator. The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 270 day period of performance.</p>
<p>Project 02, Replace 15kV Switchgear, Bldg 31 Area B. This project replaces 50 year old 15kV oil breakers in Bldg 31 with modern 15kV switchgear. The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 270 day period of performance.</p>
<p><br />Project 03, Replace aged cable serving Brick Quarters and WPAFB Club Replace Ducts/Feeders from Chapel 1 to Bldg 700. The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 210 day period of performance.</p>
<p><br />Project 04, Replace 15kV Switches Basewide, Phase 2. Replace 17 deteriorated pad-mounted switches and 15kV switchgear. Switches have become degraded due to leaking gas, struck by vehicles, etc. The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 270 day period of performance.</p>
<p><br />Project 05, Replace Transformers &amp; Bus Duct Bldg 145, Area B. The 480 volt bus ducts from the transformers to the main switchgear in Bldg 145 are leaking, allowing water to rust and deteriorate the bus duct and transformers. This project will replace four 124700-480 volt transformers and associated 480 volt bus duct, feeding Bldg 145.<br />The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 180 day period of performance.</p>

Installation Description

The electric distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

Eglin AFB is the largest base in the U.S. Air Force with more than 16,300 military and civilian personnel.  The system infrastructure at Eglin AFB includes distribution systems for the Main Cantonment Area, on-reservation Geographically Separated Units (GSUs), and off-reservation GSUs.  The electrical distribution system consists of approximately 530 miles of wire and cables rated at 115 kV, 25 kV, 12.5 kV, and 4.16 kV. 
1.  Main Cantonment Area
Gulf Power supplies electricity to the Main Cantonment Area through the following substations and infrastructure: 
•	The Gulf Power-owned Shalimar Substation supplies power to the West Gate and Valparaiso Substations through an overhead, 115-kV, three-phase transmission circuit. 
•	A 115-kV switching station connects Gulf Power to the North Gate, Foster, GWEF, Main Base, and Climatic Substations via Eglin-owned 115-kV transmission lines.
On the Installation, power for the Main Cantonment Area is supplied via seven government-owned substations.  The system consists of aerial 115-kV and 25-kV circuits as well as aerial and underground (direct bury and within conduit) 12.5-kV and 4.16-kV three-phase distribution circuits.  The system is constructed primarily in a radial configuration.  Distribution feeders provide service to pole- and pad-mounted distribution switches and transformers which, in turn, serve grouped or individual facilities.
The Base recently installed a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system in the Valparaiso Substation.  The system has the capability of controlling circuit breakers within the substation; however, that function is disabled and the SCADA system is used only to monitor electrical parameters and load flow.  The system uses wireless (RF) transmission to report to the monitoring station. 
2.  On-Reservation GSUs
On-reservation GSUs are fed primarily from electrical distribution circuits originating from the Government-owned East and West Range Substations (which are fed from the Government-owned Valparaiso Substation).  GSUs are also fed from independent circuits from CHELCO and Power South 12.47-kV distribution lines, and from the Power South 115-kV substation adjacent to the C-6 radar site. 
The East and West Range Substations are supplied from separate government-owned 25-kV circuits originating from a government-owned 25-kV switch station that is fed from the Val-P Substation.  The nominal distribution system voltage is 12.5-kV grounded wye with a limited amount of 4.16-kV distribution located at the C-6 and C-74 Sites.  All of the government-owned feeders in the East and West Ranges are configured as radial feeders, with predominantly aerial construction using wood poles.  Less than 5 percent of the distribution is underground.  Generally, poles within the ranges are old, with an average of 40 being replaced annually.  Distribution feeders provide service to pole-, pad-, and some below-grade vault-mounted distribution switches and transformers. These in turn serve grouped or individual facilities. 
The following table identifies the 64 GSU sites. A brief description of the distribution infrastructure is presented.

3.  Off-Reservation GSUs 
Currently, only one GSU site that does not fit into the West Range, East Range, or Santa Rosa Island regions is included in the UP solicitation. 
a.  Site D-3, Cape San Blas Missile Tracking Annex
Test Site D-3 is 92 miles southeast of Eglin.  There are thirteen facilities at Test Site D-3.  The system receives potable water from Lighthouse Utilities whose offices are located in the City of Port St. Joe, FL.  Government ownership begins on the downstream side of the utility-owned meter where the 2-inch PVC distribution main is connected to the meter.  

The wastewater collection system being privatized is described as follows: 

Eglin AFB is the largest base in the U.S. Air Force with more than 16,300 military and civilian personnel.  The system infrastructure at Eglin AFB includes distribution systems for the Main Base, Plew, Main Base and Plew Spray Fields, and Geographically Separated Units (GSUs).  The system includes approximately 416,751 LF of 1945 to 2005 vintage, 1 to 30" diameter pipe; 664 manholes, 104 lift stations, and 4 treatment plants.  
1.  Main Base
Eglin AFB’s Main Base Treatment System is comprised of the collection services and mains from the original Base development in the late 1940s.  The system includes mains extending west from the east gate to the north-south runway.  The system originally flowed to a treatment plant and spray fields near the bay, south of the area served.  In 1988, a new treatment plant was constructed near the Air Combat Command (ACC) gate on the west side of the Base.  Lift Station 545 was also constructed in 1988 to pump wastewater from the collection system to the new treatment plant.  Replacement piping and new construction piping is primarily PVC and new manholes have been constructed of pre-cast concrete.  Depth of burial for wastewater collections mains ranges from 4 to 15 feet, with an average of 8 feet.  Average depth of service laterals is 6 feet.  An estimated 2 percent of the collection piping is beneath paved surfaces.  Generally, tracer wire or marker tape has been installed with non-metallic replacement pipe or new construction pipe since the 1990s.  The original, pre-1990s non-ferris piping was not installed with tracer wire or marking tape.  Thirty-eight lift stations are connected to the collection system.  Two additional lift stations discharge to individual septic tanks.  Ten of the lift stations are monitored on a SCADA system.  The SCADA system is for monitoring only and includes pump on/off, wet well low level, wet well high level, flow, and alarm status.  Lift Stations 545 and 667 are considered primary lift stations.  Lift Station 667 collects wastewater from the 600 and 700 areas in the southeast corner of the Base and pumps it to the main gravity line to Lift Station 545.  Lift Station 545 is the main lift station for the Main Base Treatment System.  All collected wastewater feeds into Lift Station 545.  The lift station has an associated approximate 0.3 million-gallon (MG) storage basin connected to the wet well.  The basin is used to control a release of wastewater during heavy rainfalls and hurricanes.  Lift Station 545 pumps the wastewater across most of the Main Cantonment area to the treatment plant at the ACC gate.  The plant was constructed in 1988 and has a capacity of 1.0-million gallon per day.  The plant consists of an influent pump station, elevated bar screen, packaged plant (aeration basins, clarifier, and chlorine contact chamber within the same structure), and treated effluent pump station.  The treated effluent pump station pumps effluent to holding ponds at the spray fields.
2.  Plew
The Plew Treatment System collects and treats wastewater for the western two-thirds of the Main Cantonment area.  Wastewater from the munitions storage area is pumped to the west end of the northwest-southeast runway, where it discharges to gravity mains in the ACC area.  The main gravity trunk that runs through the ACC area discharges to Lift Station 2595 which pumps wastewater collected from the ACC area, the eastern half of MFH, and the BX/Commissary area to the 21 inch gravity main feeding the Plew Sewage Treatment Plants.  A 12-inch gravity main from the western portion of the MFH area collects and discharges to the Plew Sewage Treatment Plants.  Replacement piping and new construction piping is primarily PVC and new manholes have been constructed of pre-cast concrete.  Depth of burial for mains ranges from 4 to 20 feet, with an average of 8 feet.  Average depth of service laterals is 6 feet.   An estimated 2 percent of the collection piping is beneath paved surfaces.   Generally, tracer wire or marker tape has been installed with non-metallic replacement pipe or new construction pipe since the 1990s.  The original, pre-1990s non-ferris piping was not installed with tracer wire or marking tape.  Thirty-four lift stations are connected to the collection system.  Eight of the lift stations are monitored on a SCADA system.  The SCADA system is for monitoring only and includes pump on/off controls, wet-well low-level and high-level indicators, flow, and alarm status.  The Plew Treatment System consists of two treatment plants that share a head works.  Flow into each plant is split manually by operators.  The 0.5-mgd plant referred to as Plew 2 was constructed in 1971.   Plew 3 is a 1.0-mgd plant constructed in 1973.   Both treatment plants consist of a shared influent pump station and elevated bar screen and are packaged plants (aeration basins, clarifier, and chlorine contact chamber within the same structure).   Both treatment plants discharge to a common header where treated effluent is pumped to the holding ponds for the irrigation spray fields.
3.  Spray Fields
The spray fields service the Main Base and Plew Systems and consist of two identical holding ponds and nine separate spray fields. Only one pond is used at a time with the other a backup for hurricanes or when plant upsets occur.  Each of the 9 spray fields has 60 solid-set sprinklers on risers. The nine fields are rotated in sequence and sized to handle the combined daily treated effluent generated from the three treatment plants.  Flow to each field is manually controlled by the operators on a daily basis.

The Federal Railroad Administration, Headquarters requests information and recommendations from respondents concerning the potential project described below.  Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.  Responses are to be sent via email to aguiarp@stb.dot.gov with the Subject Line:   Collection Data Support Services, Fix Price Award no later than 3:00 p.m. eastern standard time on Mar 23, 2009.

Responses should include the following information:    

Comments will be shared with the Government and the project leaders, but otherwise will be held in strict confidence. Please provide a three (3) page capabilities statement addressing the following, and must include the offerors name, address, phone number, e-mail address, business size, Cage Code number.    

This is a source sought notice for contractors who are willing and able to take the waybill data, as submitted by the railroads to the Surface Transportation Board (STB), and develop the Master Waybill Files required by the FRA and STB (the Government).  The contractor(s) must also be willing and able to develop certain files or subsets of the Master File and statistical reports as required by the various users of the waybill data; i.e., the Public Use Waybill File, State Specific Files, Railroad Specific Files, and specific data reports to meet individual waybill request. 
The STB requires that railroads submit waybill sample data if, in any of the three preceding years, they terminated on their lines at least 4,500 revenue carloads.  These railroads may file waybill sample information by using either: (1) authenticated copies of a sample of audited revenue waybills (the manual system) or (2) a computer generated sample containing specified information (the computerized system or MRI).


Background

The Waybill Sample identifies originating and terminating freight stations, the names of all railroads participating in the movement, the point of all railroad interchanges, the number of cars, the car types, and the movement weight in hundredweights, the commodity and the freight revenue.  The names of the shipper and consignee are not included in the data.  However, other data in the sample such as the origin and destination Freight Station Accounting Code (FSAC) and seven-digit Standard Transportation Commodity Code (STCC) may permit the identification of a shipper and consignee.  Thus, the data in this raw form can disclose each railroad's significant customers and also the rate at which it transports the traffic.

Statement of Objectives

 The government is looking for the contractor  to furnish the following as required to process the waybill data submitted by the railroad industry under STB Order (49 C.F.R. 1244), as amended in Ex Parte No. 385 (Sub. No. 2), and Documentation of the Carload Waybill Sample, November 1981:

The contractor agrees to assign to this contract those key personnel whose resumes were submitted with its proposal who are necessary to fulfill the requirement within the terms and conditions of this contract.  To be accepted for this contract, the contractor must offer key personnel with the following capabilities:

a)  knowledge and working experience of the statistical theory that underlies the waybill sample.
b)  knowledge and working experience of the data processing techniques required to process the waybill.
c)  knowledge and working experience to perform the required edits and the ability to maintain and revise the programs used to process and edit the waybill data.
d)  experience with the railroad industry, knowledge of the required industry reference files, and the ability to correct collection problems and obtain corrections required by the edit process.

	2.	Materials: It is the responsibility of the contractor(s) to provide all materials necessary for successful completion of this contract.  The contractor(s) must make all arrangements necessary for access to the required Industry Reference Files (IRF).  The contractor(s) assumes all costs of for accessing and using the required IRFs and any other copyrighted materials.  These files include, but are not limited to, the Standard Transportation Commodity Code (STCC) Directory, Freight Station Accounting Code (FSAC) Directory, Universal Machine Language Equipment Register (UMLER).

	3.	Data Processing and equipment:  The contractor(s) is expected to provide the necessary data processing software and associated computer equipment to execute the tasks identified in this contract.  The contractor(s) is required to submit, with its offer, a list of hardware and software to be used.  Additionally, the contractor(s) must submit a disaster recovery plan in case of damage to data processing systems and equipment associated with waybill processing.  This plan should identify the specific steps to be taken and timeframes to get the waybill process up and running again should this occur.  Further, the contractor(s) must submit the security measures it plans to use to protect the safety and maintain the integrity of the waybill data.

	4.	facilities

	5.	copies of forms OPAD-1 and OPAD-2 as required by a railroad

6.	and all other items necessary for the collection, maintenance, control, and processing of the sample.

The railroad waybill sample data to be processed under the statement of work and will be delivered to the contractor by each railroad on either magnetic tape or electronic transmission from the computerized system (Machine Readable Input, MRI) carriers and on hard copies of waybill sample documents from non-MRI carriers.  The contractor shall maintain copies of all records and waybill documentation received from railroads as well as its own records and documentation pertaining to the collection and processing of the waybill data for a period of three years from the date the Waybill Sample is delivered to and accepted by the STB.  These records shall be available for STB review at any time.  These records shall document all steps taken by the contractor in the follow-up required to assure that the railroads are providing complete and accurate data.  The contractor will compare waybill records and documents with other sources to assure that all records required under 49 C.F.R. 1244 are submitted by the railroads and that all railroads that are required to submit documents do, in fact, submit the required data.

<DESC><p>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Global Command and Control System - Joint (GCCS-J) Program Management Office (PMO), in coordination with DISA's Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), is requesting information to determine sources sought with CORE competencies and demonstrated experience in developing and sustaining software that supports the force planning and the force execution arenas for the GCCS-J PMO. Force planning software, known as the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES), is part of the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Global Command and Control System - Joint (GCCS-J) Program Management Office (PMO). GCCS-J is the Department of Defense (DOD) Joint Command and Control (C2) system of record (SOR). The Defense Transportation System (DTS) is that portion of the Nation's transportation infrastructure that supports Department of Defense transportation needs for force execution.</p>
<p>Over the past 20 years, the Department of Defense (DOD) planning and execution community has sought to accurately assess the planned movement versus actual movement status. JOPES provides planning data in summary form. In contrast, the DTS contains item-level detail for each shipment. To accurately evaluate planned-versus-actual movement status, key data relationships between the JOPES planning data and the DTS execution data must be created and maintained.</p>
<p>The Transportation Tracking Number (TTN) premise is that the process of assigning and using unique tracking numbers for unit cargo movements from planning through execution will facilitate execution tracking. The new number, TTN, will add value to the existing values currently generated from planning to execution: the unit identification code (UIC), the unit line number (ULN) and the transportation control number (TCN). It will be compatible with all of the numerous existing and future tracking systems currently used by the planning and execution process. Overall, there are two (2) fundamental aspects of the Transportation Tracking Number (TTN) initiative: (1) the Transportation Tracking Account Number (TTAN); and (2) the completed Transportation Tracking Number (TTN). The basic TTAN account number is generated in the classified domain. The basic TTAN generator software will reside within the JOPES domain, but will be a separate entity that can be moved elsewhere. The full TTN will be completed in the DTS domain. Using the TTAN as a "seed", the DTS will create a full TTN tracking for each shipment being moved. The combined use of the TTAN and the item sequence numbers make up the full TTN.<br /><br />THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR REIMBURSE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS RFI.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Whatever information is provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process for the TTN work. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>This RFI is a request for interested parties to describe their technical capabilities and demonstrated experience with software development, sustainment, testing and fielding of software that interfaces with GCCS-J and the Defense Transportation System (DTS). All interested contractors are requested to provide written response to the following questions. All small businesses to include Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone, Women-Owned and Service Disabled are strongly encouraged to provide timely responses to this Request for Information (RFI). A response to this RFI is necessary in order to assist DISA in determining the potential levels of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability within the Small Business Community to provide the required services. In addition, this information will also be used to assist DISA in establishing a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract/small business participation plan small business goal percentages.</p>
<p>1. Requirements<br />a. Describe your experience in developing, sustaining, testing and fielding applications in the area of force planning for GCCS-J and force execution for the DTS. Include a list of software applications developed and SLOC or function points for each application.<br />b. Describe your experience of passing data to and from classified environments. Describe the applications developed and describe how they passed the data.<br />c. Describe your experience in developing and integrating software applications in a Solaris 10, Oracle 11G, and J2EE environment. <br />d. GCCS-J and DTS have critical external interfaces with the GCCS Family of Systems (FOS). Describe your experience working with and developing applications that interface with existing force planning and execution systems. <br />e. Describe your experience developing software that exchanges information with other systems and has successfully received a JITC Interoperability certification.<br />f. Force planning and execution tools must comply with the Department of Defense (DOD) Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs), the configuration standards for DOD IA and IA-enabled devices/systems. Describe your experience using the DOD Information Assurance Security Checklists, the DISA Field Security Operations (FSO) Security Readiness Review Scripts (SRRs), Retina Security Scans, and the FSO Gold Disk to verify compliance to a baseline level of security and test software for STIG compliance.<br />g. Describe your experience in fielding a C2 system worldwide. Include a list of COCOMs, Services, and agencies where the capability was fielded to include the size of the deployment and the number of users.<br />h. Provide no less than three past performance references that demonstrate force planning and execution software development, sustainment, and fielding expertise. Responses must include Agency, Agency Address, Agency POC, Phone Number, Email Address, Contract Number, Period of Performance, Negotiated price or cost of award, FTEs, and description of product or service delivered.</p>
<p>Respondents shall classify their company using one or more (if applicable) of the following NAICS Codes:<br />&bull; 541512 - Computer Systems Design Services - Size - $25M or less<br />&bull; 541712 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology) - 500 or fewer employees</p>

Task orders issued under this contract will include Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under these work orders are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires the firm and all consultants to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the contract.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the engineer, architect, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).     Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling binds, and removing material from computer hard drives using permanent erase utility or similar software.     REASONABLE CARE:   1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.  2.  Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 3.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.  The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

All contractor employees and subcontractor employees working on-site will undergo a background suitability check prior to the start of work consistent with Homeland Security Presidential Directive -12 (HSPD-12). The contractor shall submit two (2) sets of Fingerprinting (FD 258) cards and a Contractor Information Worksheet (CIW) with Section 1, Contract Employee Information completed for each employee to Ms. Christi Davis.  Ms. Davis will complete Sections 2-5 of the CIW and forward it and the fingerprint cards to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  The DHS will reply to the employee via e-mail with the website and password that the employee shall use to access the website where the employee shall complete the Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85P) electronically.   Upon receipt of the employee's electronic SF 85P, DHS will initiate the background check.  Completion of the SF 85P via the internet is MANDATORY.   However, if the employee does not have access to the internet, the contractor shall contact Ms. Davis who will furnish paper copies of the SF 85P for the employee to manually complete and return to Ms. Davis.  DHS will have the final decision to employee’s acceptability.  Ms. Davis will notify the contractor as each employee is given a favorable predetermination by DHS.  

SELECTION INTERVIEW REQUIREMENTS: 
The Government intends to conduct personal interviews with those firms slated as most highly qualified.  The tentative dates of interviews are September 16 – 18, 2008.  Firms slated for interviews may be asked to expand upon any of the information presented related to any of the evaluation criteria, to respond to questions to establish their understanding of government needs, policies and approaches, to provide technical approached and conceptual design solutions to actual/hypothetical projects, etc.  Elaborate presentations are not desired. Note: A preliminary small business subcontracting plan will be required if a slated firm is a large business concern. 
 Site visits will not be arranged during this period.  Debriefing requests will not be entertained prior to 45 days after the submittal due date.  It is the Government’s intent to incorporate Look-Up Tables into the contract which may be used as payment provisions at the Government’s discretion.

<DESC>Synopsis – Ballroom/AV/Reception Room Needs for November Honorary Awards Ceremony

Introduction
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is seeking meeting space for the Honorary Awards Ceremony to be held on November 19, 2009 and would like interested hotels to submit a proposed hotel agreement that outline the costs associated with the ceremony requirements described herein.
Location of Performance
TSA requires that the meeting space/hotel be located within the Crystal City and Pentagon City areas of Arlington County, Virginia.  Hotels that are within a reasonable walking distance from the TSA Headquarters at 701 S 12th Street, Arlington VA, 20598 are required. 
Period of Performance
TSA has identified one date that is suitable for this Honorary Awards Ceremony: November 19, 2009.  The conference ceremony will be held from 1pm to 4pm on that day, but it is critical that the hotel provide set-up services to ensure that the conference space is prepared in advance of attendee arrival. TSA will make available a point of contact with whom the vendor may work with to determine the logistics of setting up the space.  This contact will be established in a subsequent agreement with the winning vendor.  
Vendors are asked to submit cost information in accordance with this synopsis when submitting draft hotel agreements to TSA.
Specific Requirements
Meeting Space:
•	1 ballroom large enough to accommodate 900+ people.  
•	1 additional room large enough to accommodate the reception cake with setup and 30-40 people at any given time as the cake is being cut and served.  This room should be adjacent to or as close to the larger ballroom as possible.  A reception type setup is preferred.
•	1 small waiting room large enough to accommodate 6 – 10 people (Color Guard, Entertainment).
•	Side tables covered with skirts to house the various awards prior/during ceremony.
•	Side tables covered with skirts for event sign-in/reception.
 

AV needs:
•	Large Conference room with projector screen, 
•	2 additional projector screens to set up in the back of the ballroom, podium (that is able to accommodate the TSA Seal), AV Cart, and wireless microphone.
•	2 additional stand microphones for entertainment.

Refreshments (Optional – Hotels are not required to offer refreshments):
(Hotels may offer refreshments if it’s part of “package deal” price offered to TSA.  The cost of the refreshments must not be more than the aggregate cost of the other conference services such as the meeting room space, audio/visual equipment, etc.)  Hotels may also offer complimentary refreshments.
•	Afternoon refreshments:  
o	Coffee – 12 gallons (sugar, equal, creamer)
o	Iced Tea – 12 gallons
o	Iced Water – 12 gallons

Method of Award
TSA will enter into an agreement with the hotel that offers the lowest price, and meets all of TSA’s requirements.  Hotels may offer an agreement with a total price including refreshments and pricing without refreshments (for conference space and audio/visual equipment only).
Point of Contact
Interested parties should submit draft hotel agreements prior to the expiration of this posting to Frank McNally at frank.mcnally@dhs.gov.  Only electronic documents will be accepted. 
The Government reserves the right not to pursue any actions, to include the award of a purchase order contract, as a result of this synopsis.

<DESC>DME MAC Re-competes: Jurisdictions A, B, and D
Questions for Industry

Background

In 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA), Public Law 108-173. This Act amended Title XVIII of the Social Security Act by establishing the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) contracting authority (section 911 of the MMA). The MMA required that all Medicare claims processing and related functions performed by the previous fiscal intermediaries and carriers under the Medicare fee-for-service program be competed and awarded to the new MACs through use of federal procurement procedures. 

In 2006, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) awarded three Durable Medical Equipment (DME) MAC contracts to administer Medicare claims for DME benefits in jurisdictions A, B, and D (see CMS’ website at  http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicareContractingReform/ for more detail regarding the DME MAC jurisdictions). Under the MMA, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must re-compete MAC contracts at least every five (5) years. Therefore, CMS intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the contracts for DME MAC jurisdictions A, B, and D by the end of calendar year 2009.   

Model Technical Proposal Instructions

The CMS is considering modifications to its Technical Proposal instructions for the DME MAC RFP. Rather than requiring offerors to submit full written, Technical Proposals or make traditional in-person oral presentations, CMS is considering requiring offerors to submit the majority of their Technical Proposals in a video/multimedia presentation (NOTE: The CMS may also use this approach in future MAC procurements, including those for Medicare Part A and B claims processing services). The proposed instructions for this video/multimedia presentation are listed below.

•	Videos/multimedia presentations shall be submitted on a single 8.54 GB (single-sided double-layer) +R DVD.
•	The DVD shall contain the video/multimedia presentation of the offeror’s Technical Proposal for those criteria identified in section L (For the purposes of this RFI, refer to the sample criteria on page 2).
•	The video/multimedia presentation submitted by offerors shall be fully compliant with the standards found in section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended in 1998. Specifically:

§ 1194.24 Video and multimedia products.

(c) All training and informational video and multimedia productions which support the agency's mission, regardless of format, that contain speech or other audio information necessary for the comprehension of the content, shall be open or closed captioned.

(d) All training and informational video and multimedia productions which support the agency's mission, regardless of format, that contain visual information necessary for the comprehension of the content, shall be audio described.

(e) Display or presentation of alternate text presentation or audio descriptions shall be user-selectable unless permanent.

•	The video/multimedia presentation of the Technical Proposal shall not exceed 15 minutes per sub-chapter.
•	The video/multimedia presentation shall be organized into chapters and sub-chapters and in the same format and order as the technical evaluation criteria. These chapters and sub-chapters must be accessible via a main DVD menu. An example (from past MAC procurements) of evaluation criteria that would be presented on the DVD and proposed organization could be:

Chapter 1.	Technical Understanding
Sub-Chapter 1.	Program Management
Sub-Chapter 2.	Claims Processing
Sub-Chapter 3.	Provider Customer Service Program
Sub-Chapter 4.	Appeals
Sub-Chapter 5.	Medical Review
Chapter 2.	Implementation
Sub-Chapter 1.	Implementation Approach
Sub-Chapter 2.	Implementation Risk Management Plan

•	At the end of each sub-chapter, the offeror shall restate all technical innovations proposed for that section of the technical proposal.
•	The offeror shall submit the following supplemental files on the DVD:
&#61485;	Slide presentations in MS PowerPoint 2003 format (e.g., charts, graphs, and flowcharts).
&#61485;	Transcripts of spoken dialogue.
No other supplemental files shall be included on the DVD. Any information submitted in supplemental files that was not discussed during the presentation may not be considered in evaluating an offeor’s Technical Proposal.
•	Only Key Personnel shall present the offeror’s Technical Proposal in the DVD presentation. Key Personnel shall present on those criteria that represent their area of oversight and/or expertise. For example, the Claims Processing Manager would be required to present on a claims processing factor/sub-factor.

In addition to this video/multi-media presentation, CMS intends to continue to request certain elements of the Technical Proposal in writing using Microsoft Word 2003 format. Examples (from past MAC procurements) of elements that would be requested in writing could include:
•	Past Performance
•	Staffing Plan,
•	Key Personnel,
•	Implementation Personnel, and
•	Corporate Experience.

Questions for Industry 

Based upon past procurement experience and/or industry best practices, please provide your comments on these model RFP instructions for CMS’ consideration, including comments on topics such as:

1.	How much time would you need to prepare your Technical Proposal in accordance with the instructions identified above?
2.	Is the time allotted (15 minutes per sub-chapter) a reasonable amount of time for a presentation? Would you prefer an overall limit to the presentation (e.g., two hours)?
3.	What are your overall questions/concerns with CMS’ proposed approach to use a video/multimedia presentation for offerors’ Technical Proposals? Would you prefer the use of traditional in-person oral presentations? 
4.	In addition to the model instructions provided above, are there additional instructions and/or parameters that CMS needs to address to ensure that offerors understand what they need to provide in their submission and to ensure that CMS gets the information it needs to make informed judgments regarding offerors’ proposed technical approaches?
5.	Is there another media source (other than DVD) that CMS should consider for the video/multimedia presentation?
6.	Do you recommend a different format/structure for the video/multimedia presentation (other than what is described in the model Technical Proposal instructions)? Are there additional elements of a technical proposal that CMS has historically requested in a written proposal that you feel could be presented in the video/multi-media presentation?
7.	What is an appropriate page limits for slides used in your presentation?

Please provide your response to this Request for Information (RFI) at the email address (MAC_PROCUREMENT@cms.hhs.gov) no later than close of business Tuesday, March 24, 2009.  Responses should be submitted as an email attachment in Microsoft Word 2003 format.  

For purposes of this RFI, the term “vendor” refers to those members of industry providing responses to this RFI.  The vendor should identify any proprietary information in their RFI responses.  Proprietary materials will neither be distributed to nor discussed with any other vendor.  

CMS will use the information submitted in response to this RFI at its discretion and will not provide comments to any vendor’s submission.  However, responses to the RFI submitted may be reflected in the final solicitation. CMS reserves the right to contact any vendor that responds to this RFI for the sole purpose of enhancing CMS’ understanding of your RFI submission. 

This notice is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or Request for Proposal.  This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this RFI and will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with any RFI submissions.

<DESC><p>The Department of Education intends to issue a 2 month (60 days) extension to existing contract # ED-01-CO-0028/0020. The current period of performance ends on March 20, 2009. The purpose of the extension is to enable AIR staff to provide a restricted use file and additional analyses from data collected under this evaluation.
<p>On September 17, 2003, The National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE) within the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) of the U.S. Department of Education (ED) awarded contract ED-01-CO-0026/0020 to American Institute for Research (AIR) with head office at Washington, DC and MDRC in New York City to conduct a rigorous study of professional development strategies for improving early reading. The study was the first, large-scale randomized trial of teacher training and, in particular of "coaching," being implemented in schools across the country. Given the importance of the study's focus, and the implications of its findings for practitioners and policymakers, an important goal has been for NCEE to learn as much as possible from it.</p>
<p>There are a number of tasks under this project, but the remaining two include: (1) the preparation of a restricted use file and document, a requirement for all NCEE contracts and (2) some further analysis of the evaluation data, resulting in a memo for NCEE. The preparation and release of the data file was delayed by IES's own internal review and approval process. Other circumstances, including staffing issues, led AIR to delay completion of the additional analyses. <br />The 2 month (60 day) extension will allow AIR to complete the restricted use data file and documentation, which will enable other researchers to conduct analyses and benefit from the outlay of public resources on the evaluation data collection. The extension will also allow AIR to deliver a memo to NCEE with the additional analysis from the evaluation data. <br />This notice is for informational purposes only. A request for proposal is not required. Interested parties may, however, request further information no later than March 26, 2009 by email to Contract Specialist Vidya Vish at Vidya.Vish@ed.gov</p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left">The original special notice is revised to read as follows and includes a new response date of March 24, 2009.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract using Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR Part 6.302-1, for other than full and open competition. Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 only one source and no other will satisfy the agency requirement. The Government intends to award a sole source contract to Motorola, Inc., 7031 Columbia Gateway Dr, 3<sup>rd</sup> Fl.,Columbia, MO 21046-2583.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">This procurement is for two-way radio equipment for three federally owned buildings.&nbsp;Locations:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; Alfonse D'Amato Courthouse, Central Islip, &nbsp;NY; 2) Joseph Addabbo, FOB, Jamaica, NY; 3)&nbsp;&nbsp;IRS Call Center, Holtsville, NY.&nbsp; The contractor must provide parts and installation for each location.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">Motorola is an Industry Leader in Communications Systems. GSA currently utilizes a Motorola radio system at 170 Federal Plaza in Central Islip New York. At this location, there exists a Single Site Astro 25 System. Astro is Motorola's trade name for its proprietary digital radio communications technology platform which addresses the APCO 25 public safety industry standards. These standards were developed by APCO. APCO (which is an acronym for Association of Public Safety Communications Officers) is an independent committee comprised of Police and Public Safety agencies across the United States. Project 25 is the specific standard developed by APCO to address spectrum efficiency, digital migration path and encryption in the Public Safety market. This standard has come to be known within the industry as APCO 25. The Federal Government has adopted this APCO 25 Standard and has become a requirement for DHS, FPS and other agencies as a result of the post 911 security standards. At the bottom of this notice, you will find an outline which has been copied and pasted off the APCO Web site. It outlines the APCO 25 Standard.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">At the time of purchase of the radio system at 170 Federal Plaza, this site was designed as the first phase for a Multi Site Astro Simulcast System that would cover GSA's area of operation and comply with DHS and FPS APCO 25 requirements. The current project is to add two additional sites and integrate these sites with the existing equipment to create an ASTRO 25 Simulcast System. The additional equipment must be compatible with the existing Motorola ASTRO 25 Simulcast equipment to allow for a seamless integration. Motorola is the only manufacturer that can provide the equipment necessary to migrate the existing equipment into an ASTRO Simulcast System.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">&nbsp;At times, Motorola utilizes Independent Resellers to distribute their product. Motorola reserves the right determine the distribution method on all opportunities. Motorola is the only company that has knowledge of the current system which has been specifically designed and engineered for GSA with its prime site located at 170 Federal Plaza in Central Islip.</p>

<p>DETERMINATION AND FINDINGS</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Brand Name Procurement (Severn Trent ROWPU UAT-GEN-D-SW-800)</p>
<p>FINDINGS</p>
<p>1. In accordance with (IAW) FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for purchases less than the SAT, the Contracting Officer may make a determination to solicit for "brand name" only. Also, IAW IG5306 in Air Force Contracting Guidelines, J&amp;A is not required for purchases under procedures in FAR Part 13 (see above). Dollar amount on requirement does not expect to exceed the SAT.</p>
<p>2. IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1), the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. Purchasing Severn Trent ROWPU (Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit; Model UAT-GEN-D-SW-800) is required to match existing on hand material, reducing the amount of inventory required for maintenance and repairs. Additionally, this equipment is part of 819 RHS's UTC kit (deployable), satisfying size requirements for logistics. Finally, obtaining the Severn Trent ROWPU will reduce training costs, as operation for the current ROWPU is already incorporated into 819 RHS's procedures. <br /><br />3. As previously stated, the requested item is considered deployable. This capability is crucial as multiple RHS units are able to share the use of this item, specifically obtaining potable water for deployed airmen.</p>
<p>DETERMINATION</p>
<p>Based on the findings above and IAW Air Force Instructions, it is hereby determined that a brand-name procurement for this requirement for Severn Trent UAT-GEN-D-SW-800 is in the best interest of the Government and a sound business decision.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Request for Quotation (RFQ) (N55236-09-Q-8026) is issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 336611. The small business standard is 1000 employees. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-30 (Effective on February 17, 2009). DESCRIPTION: The requirement is for a firm-fixed-price (FFP) type purchase order; Contract Line Item No. (CLIN) 0001 is to provide Naval Security Boat refurbishment for one (UB-02) 19UB9220 19' BOSTON WHALER; CLIN 0002: refurbish one (UB-03) 19UB9221 BOSTON WHALER; CLIN!  0003: refurbish one (SCI-6) 28OP9710 WILLARD OIL SKIMMER; CLIN 0004: refurbish one (BMR 3) SLICK BAR OIL BOOM BOAT; CLIN 0005:  refurbish one (WHLR-7) 19UB9506 BOSTON WHALER; CLIN 0006: refurbish one (MSF 2) 18UB8621 BOSTON WHALER.  Period of performance:  03/31/2009 through 07/15/2009.  Refer to Attachment (1) for the entire statement of work. Work to be accomplished at contractor's facility. Offeror shall provide the facility name, street address, city, state, and zip code where the work is to be accomplished, with their quote. PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS: Packaging and preservation shall be performed in accordance with the best commercial practices to afford maximum protection against damage. DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS: Items shall be priced at F.O.B. Destination and shall be delivered in accordance with the attached statement of work. Offerors shall include in their quote the cost of transportation of the boats. Inspection and acceptance shall be at destination by the Government! . 52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999): (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) past performance and (ii) price. Past performance when compared to price is approximately equal in importance. (b) Options (not applicable). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. The total evaluated price will be the sum of CLINs 0001-0006. The Government will evaluate the proposed price fo! r reasonableness in accordance with FAR 15.305 (a)(1) and FAR Subpart 15.4. The Government will also determine the realism and balance of each price by comparing it to other proposed prices and the independent government estimate. Past performance is a measure of the degree to which an offeror has satisfied customers in the past and complied with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Offeror's past performance will be evaluated on the basis of the following subfactors (of past performance) which are of equal importance: 1. Technical (Quality of Product) - expected performance of the technical requirements of the subject availability based upon an offeror's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness of any implemented or proposed corrective actions. 2. Schedule - expected performance in meeting the schedule requirements of the subject availability based upon a offeror's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts a! nd the effectiveness if any implemented or proposed corrective actions. 3. Management - the expected performance in managing the subject availability based upon an offeror's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness of any implemented or proposed corrective actions. This includes an evaluation of the offeror's past performance in complying with the clauses at FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns. The Government's evaluation of your past performance will be subjective, and based mainly on performance evaluations available in the automated Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), information obtained from your references during telephone interviews and/or performance questionnaires, and information available in the Government's local files to evaluate past performance. The Government may use other sources, as appropriate. The Government will consider performance of work that you have subcontracted to another firm as your past performance. However, the Government will not conside! r the past performance of a proposed subcontractor, unless that performance was under a subcontract awarded by you. The Government will give greater consideration to contracts requiring the same or similar type and complexity of work required by the RFQ. However, other types of contracts/work may be considered as part of the past performance evaluation as well, if aspects of the past performance are deemed to have some bearing on the expected performance of the subject solicitation. Prepare and submit one Reference Information Sheet for each of the contracts that you would like the Government to consider when evaluating your past performance in the format of Attachment (2). The contracts that you reference must be ongoing or have been completed within the last three years. On the Reference Information Sheet, include the names of references who can verify that you have done the type of work that is required under the contract contemplated by this RFQ and who will provide inf! ormation about the quality of your past performance. However, the Government may not contact all of your references. If a Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR) has been completed for one or more of the contracts that you would like to reference, you need not submit a Reference Information Sheet for those contracts. Instead, you may provide a list of such contracts. Make sure that your reference information is up to date and that each reference will cooperate with us. Do not give us the names of a reference unless you have made sure that we can reach that reference at the telephone number, e-mail address, and postal address that you have provided, and that they will give us the information that we want. Offerors shall be determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104-1. Quotes shall state the unit prices and total prices of the items required, inclusive of shipping to the destination listed above. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: Quotes received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-c! ompliant. Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database will make an offeror ineligible for award. The FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process to satisfy FAR 52.212-3. More information on ORCA is found at https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

<DESC>This is a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation for commercial items/services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request  For Quotation (RFQ) number HSCG44-09-Q-COP004 is assigned for tracking purposes only. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-30 Cor. The US Coast Guard Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN) intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Purchase Order using Simplified Acquisition Procedures for the purchase of  1 each  External Battery System rated for 12 minutes at a 120 kVA load with the following features: Eight (8) External Battery Cabinet(s) Model: 38BP080XMX1BNS. Each Battery Cabinet must contain (40) Battery Jars. All Items are to be New, Used items are not acceptable. Start-Up Services to be scheduled by CG Technical POC assigned at award. The proposed contract action resulting from this synopsis/solicitation for commercial supplies is the Governments intention to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 13.106-1(b). Interested persons/parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotations/proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement, and for informational purposes. The contractor for this proposed Sole Source contract is: LIEBERT Corp., Cage Code 1LM60. This is a Sole Source Procurement. The following is the Justification that will be made part of the Awarded Purchase Order File.

Justification For Other Than Full and Open Competition
(a)	Each justification shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited. As a minimum, each justification shall include the following information: 

(1)	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for other than full and open competition." 

*The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Coast Guard C2CEN, 4000 CG Blvd, Portsmouth, VA 23703, hereby presents this Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOTFOC) for review and approval.

(2)	Nature and/or description of the action being approved. 

*External Battery System from Liebert Company of Richmond, VA.  The requested battery system will complete a previously approved UPS(Uninterrupted Power Supply) system purchased by C2CEN (via the Truestone Company) during 2008.

(3)	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value). 

*External Battery System rated for 12 minutes at a 120kVA load with the following features:
- Eight (8) External Battery Cabinet(s) model number:  38BP080XMX1BNS
- Stand-alone battery cabinets are shipped separately and include side panels.  Others
   supply interconnecting cables.
	- Each battery cabinet contains forty (40) battery jars.

*Liebert Services Battery System Start-up Services include the following:
	- Start-up is scheduled at the customer’s designated time.

*Shipping: 
	- FOB Destination Terms and Conditions

*Total Estimnated Price 
	- $99,000.00

(4)	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 

*6.302-1 (2) (ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components there, of, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.

(5)	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.

*The Libert Company mandates that the Battery System requested is the only one that will work with the UPS system components already purchased by C2CEN, and be covered by their warranty service agreed upon in the original contract agreement.

(6)	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. 

*Requirement shall be posted on FED-BIZ-OPS with this JOTFOC.

(7)	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. 

*It is anticipated that the purchase prices offered by the Contractor will be fair and reasonable, as compared to applicable Market Research.  Market Research has shown similar items prices to be equal or more that the purchase price of the units being purchased.

(8)	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. 

*This is a continuation of an originally agreed upon and executed purchase.  The purchase of the Battery System will complete an order to a UPS system purchased by C2CEN – numerous components of which have been delivered locally and are waiting at Truestone Company’s warehouse in Suffolk, VA to be delivered to C2CEN, and joined with the Battery System requested.  At the time of the original purchase for the overall UPS system in 2008, the market research and competition for the contract had already been completed.  Market Research shall be conducted via GSA and Internet searches. 

(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: 
(i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. 
(ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. 
(iii) When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government. 

*Specifications and engineering descriptions related to the required Battery System provided by the Liebert Company have already been completed, and were submitted to C2CEN for review and were approved during 2008.  As a result, C2CEN at that time agreed to purchase the requested Battery System from the Liebert Company as part of a larger overall UPS system.  To open the contract for open bidding for an equivalent battery system would result in shipment delays and potentially greater expense to the Coast Guard.  Additionally, Liebert will not warranty a battery system provided by another company or agent not approved for use with the existing UPS components the Coast Guard has already purchased.  It is Estimated that it would cost the USCG/Government at a minimum  $250,000.00  to completely re-engineer/re-develop a UPS System using this type of application.  

(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. 

*None at this time.

(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. 

*None required.








(12) Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief. 
(b) Each justification shall include evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
      Informal forum with the Ombudsman:. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
      Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

U.S. Bank informed HUD that it was entitled to receive approximately $45 million, although that estimate has since changed. In September 2006, U.S. Bank engaged Denlin Associates, Inc. to perform an audit covering the period 8/30/88 through 9/30/06. HUD needs to confirm the accuracy and thoroughness of these funds by hiring an independent accounting firm to review the books, records and to determine the amount due and owing to the government at this time. We also need to determine the current balance based on activity since 9/30/06 as well as an analysis on the 88 issues of bearer Bonds representing the underlying loans held by the Trust.<br /><br />1.2 Background<br /><br />Congress established the Public Facilities Loan Program (PFLP) in 1955 to provide low-interest financial assistance to small municipalities in the construction of public works such as water, sewer, hospital and other public facilities. The PFLP was terminated in 1975 but projects in process at the time were permitted to be funded at the time they came to fruition.<br /><br />In January 1987, HUD offered a loan repurchase program applicable to the PFLP loans (the "1987 Loan Repurchase Program) under which borrowers that were current in their loan payments were given the opportunity to repurchase such loans in full and at discounts from their outstanding balances on or before May 29, 1987. HUD realized gross receipts of approximately $8.4 million from 52 borrowers having an aggregate outstanding principal balance of approximately $9.9 million. The 1987 Loan Repurchase Program ended on May 29, 1987 and no similar program subsequently has occurred or presently is contemplated. No loan has any prepayment thereof pending.<br /><br />HUD was directed by OMB (by letter dated March 21, 1988) to sell loans from its portfolio of PFLP loans (the "Portfolio") in fiscal year 1988, in order to meet Federal outlay reduction targets and certain Federal credit management goals. On August 29, 1998, HUD sold 1,196 loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of approximately $271,950,000 to the Public Facility Loan Trust (the "Trust") for a purchase price equal to $174,663,564, which represented net proceeds from the sale of the loans equal to $172,762,791 plus accrued interest of $1,900,773, and certificates evidencing ownership of the two classes of beneficial interests in the net assets of the Trust. The Trust issued four classes of sequential pay bonds on August 29, 1988, with an aggregate par value of $235,958,000 on that date, using the loans as collateral.<br /><br />The Trust is a closed-end, diversified management investment company organized in order to engage solely in the activities of issuing Bonds and certificates, acquiring the collateral and certain related transactions. Shawmut Bank, N.A. was trustee (the "Owner Trustee") on behalf of the Trust. The Trust was organized as a special purpose business trust under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts pursuant to a declaration of trust (the "Declaration of Trust") executed and filed by the Owner Trustee with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on July 8, 1988. <br /><br />1.3 Objective<br /><br />To conduct an Audit for the purpose of determining the amount of money now due to the government. <br /><br />Specifically identify each transaction (including identifying the payor/payee and type of transaction). Fully describe the PFLT accounts and their relationship to HUD along with confirming amounts from the beginning of the Trust accounts to present day. Reflect the excess or shortage by period and the accumulated total of such. Isolate the cause of any excesses and shortages relative to the dividend payment periods.<br /><br />Also, analyze the existence of 88 issues of municipal bearer Bonds representing the underlying loans held by the Trust. Provide a thorough breakdown of the bearer Bonds value from its inception until present day.<br /><br />Upon completion of the Audit a workbook containing the findings must be created. The workbook must contain all of the transactions as well as the auditor's analysis. Any problems or discrepancies must be identified along with a recommended action or disposition.<br /><br />1.4 Scope<br /><br />The scope of services for this action is limited to providing CPD assistance with respect to the funding required to hire an outside accounting firm for conducting the necessary Audit of the Public Facility Loan Trust Account. <br /><br />The auditor is required to provide HUD with access to all books, accounts, records, reports, files, etc. pertaining to their receipt and use of HUD's funds. These provisions also apply to any sub-recipient of the funds, including contractors and subcontractors. The actual scope of services will cover the administrative and program controls and activities of the auditing firm, their contracted administrative agents or sub-recipients, or ultimate beneficiaries of the funds.<br /><br />The Audit must include a review of the laws that established the PFLT and why the program was terminated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A thorough examination of the audit conducted by Denlin Associates, Inc. on September 2006 must be conducted. In addition to covering the period reviewed by Denlin's audit, a further breakdown of the period covering the date of that audit to the present.<br /><br />2.0 In order to be considered for this solicitation, your proposal must include the following information:<br /><br />a.

As used in this clause&mdash; &ldquo;Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database&rdquo; means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. &ldquo;Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number&rdquo; means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities. &ldquo;Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number&rdquo; means the DUNS number means the number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern. &ldquo;Registered in the CCR database&rdquo; means that&mdash; (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record &ldquo;Active&rdquo;. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process. (b) (1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation &ldquo;DUNS&rdquo; or &ldquo;DUNS+4&rdquo; followed by the DUNS or DUNS+4 number that identifies the offeror&rsquo;s name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number&mdash; (i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. (2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: (i) Company legal business name. (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. (iii) Company physical street address, city, state and Zip Code. (iv) Company mailing address, city, state and Zip Code (if separate from physical). (v) Company telephone number.

Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government&rsquo;s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, &ldquo;doing business as&rdquo; name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day&rsquo;s written notification of its intention to: (A) Change the name in the CCR database; (B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor&rsquo;s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the &ldquo;Suspension of payment&rdquo; paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757. 52.213-4 -- Terms and Conditions -- Simplified Acquisitions (Other Than Commercial Items).

<DESC>The following questions have been asked and the answers are provided below:

Question 1:  We have been working to establish our Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  There have been some technical delays associated with the registration.  Is it possible for us to submit our quote without the CCR?
Answer 1:  Quoters must be able to show that they have made an attempt to register at CCR, http://www.ccr.gov. You can submit an email, a copy or screenshot of the CCR page, etc. to show your attempt to comply with the requirements of the solicitation.

Question 2:  Does my firm need to have a GSA Schedule in order to submit a quote?
Answer 2: No, you do not need to have a GSA Schedule to respond to the request for quote.  All vendors are encouraged to submit a response.

Question 3:  Are electronic submissions acceptable?
Answer 3.  Yes, electronic submissions are acceptable.  If the quotes are delivered by email, they must be followed by one (1) signed hardcopy original of each quote within four (4) business days of the closing date (see RFQ Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Quoters).

Question 4:   Which Division(s) and/or Offices at the SEC is requesting this RFP?  Will the access be shared across multiple Divisions/Offices?  Division of Enforcement, Corporate Finance, etc...?
Answer 4:  Access for service obtained as a result of this request for quote would be for any SEC staff member in any SEC office or location who needed the service.

Question 5:  What are the historical requirements for the accounting and compliance issues (for example tracking 3 to 5 years of historical disclosure information for trending purposes)?
Answer 5:  There is no explicit requirement for a specific time period to be considered for trending purposes.

Question 6:  Is the SEC looking for the vendor to provide an off the shelf web based service or a custom application of their service, or a combination of both?  Is the SEC expecting custom development services to be included in the quote?
Answer 6:  The SEC is looking for an available commercial product that will meet the requirement.

Question 7:  Does the SEC expecting training and support services to be quoted as a separate item/deliverable?    
Answer 7:  Standard training and support should be included in the price quotation for the service, not as a separate item.  If advanced training and support is available , please price it separately.

Question 8:  Has the SEC developed a model to identify "entities with operational weaknesses and higher risk of financial statements fraud," through the "key risk" indicators cited, or would the Contractor be required to develop such a model? 
Answer 8:  The SEC has not developed a model to identify "entities with operational weaknesses and higher risk of financial statements fraud."  It is up to the quoter to determine how to fulfill the requirement. 

Question 9:  If a model is to be developed by the Contractor, would the model require approval of SEC staff prior to system implementation? 
Answer 9:  The SEC is looking looking for an available commercial product that will meet the requirement.  Therefore, we do not anticipate that a model will be developed by the contractor as a result of this solicitation.

Question 10:   Does SEC expect that the service will produce automated reports only, or will subjective analyses by trained analysts be required?  If trained analysts are required, what are the professional qualifications expected of such analysts (eg, CFA, CPA, etc.)? 
Answer 10:  The requirement is for expert research reports, developed from analysis of public company financial information.  These reports are to be made available via a web interface and email alerts.

Question 11:  Given the complexities of such an assignment both from a methodology and technology perspective, will SEC consider extending the date for which Quotes are due for 30 days?
Answer 11:  The SEC is looking for an available commercial product that will meet the requirement.  Therefore, the response date will not be extended.

Question 12:  Given the complexities of building the methodology for such a service, will SEC consider modifying the RFQ to make completion of such tasks, Time and Materials, rather than Firm Fixed Price?
Answer 12:  The SEC is looking for an available commercial product that will meet the requirement.  Therefore, the contract will be awarded on a Firm Fixed Price basis.

Question 13:  Will questions be accepted after 1:00pm Eastern on March 12, 2009.
Answer 13:  Questions submitted after 1:00pm Eastern on March 12, 2009 will not be answered.

<DESC>THIS IS A SPECIAL NOTICE, TO INDUSTRY, REGARDING IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPLIANCE PARAMENTER OF THE ARMY LANDWARNET NETOPS ARCHITECTURE (LNA).<BR><BR>The Army has developed a reference model for The Army Enterprise Network Operations (NetOps) known as The Army LandWarNet NetOps Architecture (LNA), providing an objective target for how NetOps will be managed across the Army Enterprise. <BR><BR>The Army LNA is the baseline enterprise NetOps reference architecture for the Armys LandWarNet.  As an integrated architecture, the LNA provides an enterprise level Army statement of NetOps requirements through the Operational, Systems, and Technical views.   These views together depict a holistic approach to NETOPS with functional capabilities designed to support tool evaluation/selection.<BR><BR>Achieving NetOps systems interoperability and integration across the Army Enterprise Infostructure is challenging due to the extraordinarily large and diverse organizations and existing stove-pipe tools and systems.  Standardizing a scalable NetOps toolset is an Army priority.<BR><BR>An optimal way to achieve standardization and increase NetOps systems interoperability and integration is to address the acquisition process.  As a result, it is the intent of the Army to enforce Compliance of the Armys LNA Capabilities into the NetOps systems acquisition process to enhance and ensure interoperability and integration across the Army Enterprise.<BR><BR>The NETCOM/9th Signal Command has responsibility to ensure all NetOps software/tools are compliant to the LNA and received a Certificate of Networthiness (CoN) prior to approval to field or connect to the Army Enterprise.  NetOps software/tools are those products (COTS/GOTS) utilized on or for the LandWarNet, which monitor, manage, coordinate, and control the Army Enterprise Infostructure.  Compliance to the Army LNA will influence the Armys future tools and product selection process.   <BR><BR>The NETCOM/9th Signal Command has developed Compliance Checklists (http://www.netcom.army.mil/LNA_Webpage/LNABIN.htm), for each of the NetOps Capabilities identified in the Army LNA.  <BR><BR>Posting of these documents on the FedBizOpps is to provide industry the criteria necessary for their products to be compliant to the LNA.  In order for NetOps software/tools to be considered for selection, Army requiring activities must obtain a CoN from NETCOM/9th Signal Command, as stated in AR 25-1.  (See chapters 2-2, 2-15 thru 2-27, and 6-3).  As a part of the CoN approval process, NetOps products must be Compliant to the LNA.  <BR><BR>The posting of these documents is a notice to industry regarding the LNA performance parameters and providing an access to the Compliance Checklists, for each of the Army LNA Capabilities, for industries use in performing a Self Evaluation wherein they can evaluate their product against the LNA, to determine level of compliance. <BR><BR>When reviewing or preparing to acquire NetOps COTS software and tools, for use on the Army LandWarNet, Army proponents may request this checklist, from vendors, as part of their market research efforts.  At the time a CoN is submitted, by the Army proponent, a completed checklist will be submitted to NETCOM/9th Army Signal Command for review and assessment of product for NETOPS Capabilities Verification and Certification of compliance to the Army LNA.  The checklists will only be assessed when submitted to the NETCOM/9th Signal Command by Army proponents.  <BR><BR>Vendors should not directly submit their completed checklists to the NETCOM/9th Signal Command, as they will not be assessed. <BR><BR>The Army-proponent provided checklists will be utilized by the NETCOM/9th Signal Command, in their compliance evaluation of vendors NetOps software and tools, prior to a CoN being granted.<BR><BR>Prospective procurement of such products will be advertised and procured by Army Agencies requiring products.  <BR><BR><BR>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  WE ARE NOT SOLICITING PRODUCTS AT THIS TIME. <BR>

<p>The following modification should be made to the Design Package:</p>
<p>On page 1, under PROJECT DESCRIPTION, paragraph 2.1.1, "quality D for the survey" should read "quality A for the survey."</p>
<p>Quality Level A involves the use of nondestructive digging equipment at critical points to determine the precise horizontal and vertical position of underground utilities, as well as the type, size, condition, material, and other characteristics. This activity is called "locating." It is the highest level presently available. When surveyed and mapped, precise plan and profile information are available for use in making final design decisions. By knowing exactly where a utility is positioned in three dimensions, the designer can often make small adjustments in elevations or horizontal locations and avoid the need to relocate utilities. Additional information such as utility material, condition, size, soil contamination, and paving thickness also assists the designer and utility owner in their decisions.</p>

USAFA will provide landing strip and work with contractor to obtain FAA certification of authorization (COA) for operations over designated area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Questions for potential offerors:</p>
<p>1. Do you have a Class 3 Unmanned Aerial System with dual-controlled instructor override environment that would be available by 12 July 2009 or other system that would provide instructor override during flight operation?</p>
<p>2. Has your proposed system been flight tested or do the specifics allow for flight at density altitude of 14,000 feet in climatic conditions associate with mountain conditions existing at USAFA?</p>
<p>3. Has your system obtained an FAA experimental certification or are you currently operating under an existing certificate of operation (COA)?</p>
<p>4. Has your company (either directly or with partners) ever supported a demonstration orientation program of this nature?</p>
<p>5. Are there civilian entities that operate your system?</p>
<p>6. If you company has provided a program of this nature, do you have an existing flight training syllabus that could be used to meet the program objectives or can you develop a training syllabus for flight operations by 12 July 2009?</p>
<p>7. In order to provide this program would you need to leave assets at USAFA?</p>
<p>8. Please provide an estimate of anticipated cost for both sessions as defined.</p>

*****************************************************

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure a Flight Deck Lights (FDL) System in support of PMS 500’s DDG 1000 Program.  The tasks cover design, fabrication, testing and delivery of the production representative model, as well as support for integration, installation and checkout.  Upon successful completion of developmental test, integration test and first article test the Government may exercise contract options for production and fielding of seven systems and spares.  A competitive 100% Small Business Set Aside is anticipated.

The FDL program objective is the acquisition and initial support of a set of lighting fixtures that will enable safe launch and recovery of aircraft on DDG 1000 as well as provide means to safely accomplish flight deck operations between the ship, pilot and flight deck personnel.  Required lighting fixtures to make up a ship set include a Flight deck surface floodlights (quantity per set: 8 mounted in the 6.3” berm, 4 mounted in the 17.25” berm sections adjacent to the touchdown circle, 1 mounted in the starboard aft 17.25” berm section; total of 13 flight deck surface floodlight fixtures); Maintenance floodlights (for illumination during maintenance operations) (quantity per set: 16);	Hangar face floodlights (quantity per set: 6); Pencil line illuminators (for illumination of forward limit lines and aft limit lines on the flight deck and extended center and Aircraft-Ship Interface Secure and Traverse (ASIST) System lines on the hangar door) (quantity per set: 4 mounted in the berm, 2 mounted under the hangar top hat on the Multi-Function Display (MFD), which is a horizon reference and deck status system being designed for the DDG 1000 ; total of 6 pencil line light fixtures); Deck edge outline lights (quantity per set: 12 long fore-aft edge lights, 3 long athwart ship lights, and 2 short athwart ship lights); Hangar and deck structure outline lights (quantity per set: 8 short, 4 long; these include 2 forward structure long in vertical orientation, 2 forward structure short in horizontal orientation, 2 hangar long in vertical orientation, 2 hangar short in vertical orientation and 4 hangar short in horizontal orientation); Helicopter In-Flight Refueling (HIFR) lights (for refueling line-up) (quantity per set: 3); Corridor lights (for pilot line up during approach) (quantity per set: 4); Vertical drop line lights (for extended centerline and pilot line-up during approach) (quantity per set: 2); Centerline lights (for pilot line-up) (quantity per set: 5); and Day wave-off lights (for pilot wave-off during day-time operations) (quantity per set: 2).
 
All of the lighting fixtures will be required to interface to the Advanced Lighting System (ALS) controller, which is being designed and provided by a subcontractor to Northrop Grumman Ship Systems. The ALS will supply the lights with power and control the on/off functions of each of the lighting fixtures as well provide dimming and flash sequence capability.  The FDL program will involve designing, building and testing production representative fixtures in order to achieve the objectives set forth in the DDG 1000 Operational Requirements Document (ORD) and to demonstrate conformance to the FDL System Specification with the option to purchase production fixtures.  The MFD contract is a portion of the next generation suite of Visual Landing Aids which will be incorporated into the DDG 1000.

The technical drawing package for the Flight Deck Lights (FDL) is now available.  There is no solicitation available at this time, but copies of the package are available upon request.  The Draft RFP will be posted upon completion.

Copies of the drawing package will be issued to the companies that respond to the FedBizOpps synopsis, as well as those companies on the solicitation mailing list.  Because the specifications and drawings are subject to Export Control Laws, the companies are required to register with the United States/Canada Joint Certification Office through the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), and provide a copy of their executed DD Form 2345 to the contracting office before a copy of the drawing package is mailed.  If you have previously supplied a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, it is not required for you to resubmit.  It is mandatory to register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.  The CCR provides the DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System + 4 number) number and a company’s CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code that will be required to conduct business with the Department of Defense.

Award will be based on a determination of “Best Value”, which may require discussions with the offerors. The evaluation factors will be Technical, Experience, Past Performance, and Price.  Copies of DD Form 2345 and request for copies of the drawing package shall be forwarded to Mr. David Andreoli, 732-323-5208, david.andreoli@navy.mil, fax # 732-323-7440.

Representatives of US companies who have subsidiaries in foreign countries expecting to participate will also be considered under foreign national rules.  Note that information to be provided is subject to export controls.  Please ensure a certified DD From 2345 is sent to NAVAIR Contracts with your request for performance parameters.

<DESC>This amendment to notice N00019-09-R-0226 (previously N00019-08-R-0057) is to provide industry additional information on the STUAS Early Operational Capability (EOC) as discussed in the draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) provided in the 03Feb09 FedBizOpps announcement.  

The EOC requirements will be included in the request for proposal as option contract line items (CLINs).  Should the government decide to exercise any of the EOC option CLINs, the EOC systems and support may be deployable to both land based CONUS and OCONUS locations. The OCONUS locations are anticipated to be collocated with Marine units in a combat zone.  EOC option CLINs may include requirements for initial operational assessment, hardware systems and contractor provided services for the operation, maintenance, training and logistics of the systems. 

This amendment further corrects the Initial Operational Capability (IOC) dates listed in the draft SOO to be FY12 instead of FY11.

The draft Flight Demonstration Instruction is hereby released. Note that per the Flight Demonstration Instruction, the Government reserves the right to change flight profiles and events based upon range availability.

DescriptionThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER), Office of Emergency Management (OEM), has a requirement to maintain and operate three diversely located Portable High-Throughput Integrated Laboratory Identification Systems (PHILIS) units.  The PHILIS units, each consisting of two to three separate mobile vehicles, are designed to detect Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs) and Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs).  These units provide on-site mobile laboratory capabilities to support the EPA?s Environmental Response Laboratory Network (ERLN), to respond to chemical warfare agent attacks, and to provide analytical support to any supplemental locations that are deemed fundamental to accomplishing EPA?s mission.  
In addition, the PHILIS units may: 	Participate in EPA and interagency exercises 	Participate in activities in foreign countries 	Deploy to Superfund sites to perform environmental analyses at the request of EPA Regional Offices 	Function at their bases of operations or at sites of interest to EPA to analyze routine and non-routine analytical samples 	Support method development and method validation efforts 	Support EPA?s training efforts for the Laboratory Response Corps.
The Government intends to award this effort as an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with one (1) 2-year base period, one (1) 2-year award term and one (1) 3-year award term. The Government contemplates release of the solicitation on or about March 28, 2009, with proposals due thirty (30) days after the release date. The solicitation will be synopsized in FedBizOpps (https://www.fbo.gov) and on the US EPA Office of Acquisition Management website (http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/ersc/PHILIS/index.htm).

Proposals will be evaluated on the above factors using a numbered rating scheme from `5? (response is superior in most features) to `0? (factor is not addressed or is totally deficient and without merit.)
The Government will host a contractor site visit to be conducted after the RFP is released.  This site visit will offer potential contractors the opportunity to inspect the mobile laboratories.  Information about the site visit will be posted on the website referenced below after the RFP is released.

<DESC>Following are comments from the GSA structural engineer regarding design review expectations.  This pertains to the construction document submittal that will be required of the awardee (not proposal requirements):

Although the proposed chiller and the existing chiller weigh approximately the same amount, the proposed chiller will have a different weight distribution, a different footprint and a different bolt pattern.  In addition, the proposed chiller will be installed per the requirements of a different and more current Building Code. 

In terms of structural design, I would expect to see calculations that verify that the existing roof framing has the capacity to resist a combination of vertical and lateral forces that are specified by the 2006 International Building Code, Section 1613 and the ASCE Standard, ASCE/SEI 7-05, Section 13.6, “Mechanical and Electrical Components”.

In terms of structural drawings, I would expect to see structural plans, sections and details that will illustrate the complete and final installation of the new chiller unit that are based upon the manufacturer's recommendations for installation of their product and the strength requirements identified by the Engineer-of-Record's structural calculations.

I will be expecting a submittal that contains these structural drawings and structural calculations, including the vendor's catalogues that pertain to the new chiller, for review and approval.

The U.S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone concern, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern (SDVOSB), or Small Business Concerns.

At the present time, this acquisition is expected to be issued as a Small Business set aside.

<DESC>Question:  How can we obtain a copy of the GBAD Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) to ensure our responses are consistent with the documented functional objectives and desirable system characteristics?
Answer:  The ICD is classified and will not be released in conjunction with this Request For Information (RFI).  The non-classified concepts contained in the ICD that are pertinent are listed in the RFI.  Additionally, the draft ICD is being staffed for approval at the Marine Requirements Oversight Counsel level.
Question:  For the purposes of this RFI, what is the definition of Low Observable/Low Radar Cross Section threats? 
Answer:  In order to allow for the widest distribution of responses, vendors are allowed to define this term in accordance with their own definition.
Question:  Please clarify the desired response date. 
Answer:  Responses received by 18 March 2009 will be accepted.
Question:  What is the provision for submission of classified content for this RFI response?
Non-classified responses are preferred, although it is understood that the government may have follow-up questions that require a classified response.  If a vendor has classified materials to submit in the initial response to this RFI, it must arrive at Marine Corps Systems Command during normal business hours-- 7AM - 3PM, Monday - Friday.  Classified information should be submitted in accordance with NISPOM transmission regulations.  The address for classified materials is as follows:
CommanderMARCORSYSCOMAttention: CMCC2200 Lester StQuantico, VA 22134-6050
Request:  I would like to be able to have a "Discovery Session" with you and your Engineering/Program Staff.
Response:  We have determined that discovery sessions are not required prior to submission of RFI responses.
Question:  What is the estimated procurement quantity?
Answer:  The decision and scope of any procurement relating to this RFI will not be finalized until after completion of the AOA.  If a material solution is identified to address the ICD, the following information would be used to determine a procurement quantity.  There are a total of two LAAD Battalions; there are 60, 2-man teams in each battalion for a total of 120, 2-man teams for the entire GBAD community.  Based on identified capabilities, it is unknown whether or not the LAAD Battalions will go to 3 man teams vice 2 man teams.  This would then make a total of 80 teams for the entire GBAD community; 40 teams per battalion.  It may be possible that given this information, 80-120 systems may be required in the future.  The fielding strategy is undetermined at this time.  Options would be to put a new system on existing A-MANPADS vehicles or to field a complete new system intact.  The AOA being developed will provide the information needed to complete a fielding strategy.
Question:  What is the estimated procurement time line?
Answer:  Since the ICD is still in draft form and the AOA is being developed, an estimated procurement timeline is not finalized.  
Question:  Is there an estimate for when either an Industry Day or RFP might be issued?
Answer:  If and when this is planned is based upon the outcome of the AOA.  
Question:  Has the GBAD Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) been approved by the JROC?  If not, when will the JROC review occur?  If so, when is the expected Materiel Development Decision?
Answer:  JROC approval is not anticipated as this is an ACAT III Program.  The draft ICD has been endorsed by the CDIB and is being staffed to the MROC for approval.
Question:  Since the GBAD ICD was not released to RFI Respondents, will the USMC release the operational view (OV) products that are contained in the ICD that will help respondents better understand concept of operations for this warfighting capability?  If so, can these OV products be delivered with the answers to the questions on 11 March 2009?
Answer:  Unfortunately, we are unable to provide the OV because the ICD is still in staffing.

<ARCHDATE>04122009
<AWARDEE>Integrity Management Consulting, Inc & Acquisition Solutions, Inc.
<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Office of General Supplies and Services sought  to establish multiple blanket purchase agreements (BPAs) for acquisition support services against Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) 874 Mission Oriented Business Integration Services (MOBIS), Special Item Number (SIN) 874 6, Acquisition Management Support. All offices within GSA, including FAS and Public Building Service (PBS), will have access to a primary and a backup BPA specifically established for their geographic region.  The BPAs can be utilized with or without Recovery Act funds.  The BPA will be used to support specific projects related to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and help achieve discounts through agency-wide economies of scale.  President Barack Obama’s new economic stimulus package, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, involves investments in the nation's infrastructure, including construction projects, environmental, and energy initiatives, that will significantly increase GSA's procurement duties.   It is expected that the need for acquisition support services encompasses more than the implementation period of the economic stimulus package, as GSA is already experiencing shortages of experienced contracting personnel needed for specific projects, hence the ongoing need for acquisition management support services. 

The solicitation was issued through GSAs eBuy system as RFQ #343559.  BPAs have been established with Integrity Management Consulting, Inc as the primary BPA holder and Acquisition Solutions, Inc as the backup BPA holder for  the National Capital Region/Central Office of GSA.   The location of the work will depend on the details of the Task Order issued against the BPA.   

Since these are BPAs, no funds have been obligated as a result of this action.  The BPAs have a Period of Performance of 5 years, with one (1) base year and four (4) option years beginning on the date of establishment.

It is anticipated that the primary and backup BPA holders for the remaining GSA regions will be established in the near future.

<AWARDEE>AT&T Corporation, 1900 Gallows Rd 6th Floor, Vienna, VA 22812-3685 US
<DESC><p>Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) has awarded sole-source extension modifications for the three DISN Transmission Services-CONUS Extension (DTS-CE) Contracts DCA200-99-D-0050 with AT&amp;T, Contract DCA200-99-D-0051 with Verizon Business Network Services (Verizon), and Contract DCA200-99-D-0052 with Sprint.  The modifications of the three contracts referenced above are a continuation of the existing work performed by AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Sprint.  All three contracts were competitively awarded on 23 March 1999.  DISA is extending the existing three contracts with AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Sprint to allow for the sustainment of services until approximately 2522 circuits are transitioned from the existing contracts.  These modifications will extend the period of performance of the contracts from 23 March 2009 to 22 March 2010 with two additional one year options for contract DCA200-99-D-0050 (AT&amp;T) and DCA200-99-D-0051 (Verizon), and from 23 March 2009 to 22 March 2010 with one additional one year option for contract DCA200-99-D-0052 (Sprint).  The DTS-CE contracts provide sub-T1 through OC-N point-to-point transmission services for the Department of Defense and its Services and Agencies and other Federal Departments within the Continental United States.  In addition to transmission services, the DTS-CE contracts provide (as specified by the Government) post, camp, and station wiring to accommodate transmission service delivery to or between any Government identified Service Delivery Point(s) (SDPs).   Contractors must maintain any equipment they installed and provide trouble administration functions to enable users to report problems that effect service, to resolve reported problems, and to determine the status of trouble reports.    The DTS-CE Contractors ensure the protection of the circuits and the network management data transported or contained within the circuits. Network management data includes accounting, configuration, fault, performance, and security management data, service provisioning, and trouble administration. Such information is critical to ensuring the availability of the network and as such, shall require appropriate mechanisms to protect from unauthorized disclosure and modification.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  All inquiries regarding the sole source modification shall be submitted electronically and directed to Scott F. Sautman, Contract Officer, at scott.sautman@disa.mil or Leroy Woolridge, Contract Specialist at leroy.woolridge@disa.mil.  (NAICS) 517110 is applicable to this acquisition.</p>

<DESC><p>Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) has awarded sole-source extension modifications for the three DISN Transmission Services-CONUS Extension (DTS-CE) Contracts DCA200-99-D-0050 with AT&amp;T, Contract DCA200-99-D-0051 with Verizon Business Network Services (Verizon), and Contract DCA200-99-D-0052 with Sprint.  The modifications of the three contracts referenced above are a continuation of the existing work performed by AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Sprint.  All three contracts were competitively awarded on 23 March 1999.  DISA is extending the existing three contracts with AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Sprint to allow for the sustainment of services until approximately 2522 circuits are transitioned from the existing contracts.  These modifications will extend the period of performance of the contracts from 23 March 2009 to 22 March 2010 with two additional one year options for contract DCA200-99-D-0050 (AT&amp;T) and DCA200-99-D-0051 (Verizon), and from 23 March 2009 to 22 March 2010 with one additional one year option for contract DCA200-99-D-0052 (Sprint).  The DTS-CE contracts provide sub-T1 through OC-N point-to-point transmission services for the Department of Defense and its Services and Agencies and other Federal Departments within the Continental United States.  In addition to transmission services, the DTS-CE contracts provide (as specified by the Government) post, camp, and station wiring to accommodate transmission service delivery to or between any Government identified Service Delivery Point(s) (SDPs).   Contractors must maintain any equipment they installed and provide trouble administration functions to enable users to report problems that effect service, to resolve reported problems, and to determine the status of trouble reports.    The DTS-CE Contractors ensure the protection of the circuits and the network management data transported or contained within the circuits. Network management data includes accounting, configuration, fault, performance, and security management data, service provisioning, and trouble administration. Such information is critical to ensuring the availability of the network and as such, shall require appropriate mechanisms to protect from unauthorized disclosure and modification.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  All inquiries regarding the sole source modification shall be submitted electronically and directed to Scott F. Sautman, Contract Officer, at scott.sautman@disa.mil or Leroy Woolridge, Contract Specialist at leroy.woolridge@disa.mil.  (NAICS) 517110 is applicable to this acquisition.</p>
