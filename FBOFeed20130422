<DESC>The Headquarters Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency (HQ AFISRA), Directorate of Communications has a requirement for IT Security Risk Management services. The Government requires essential information technology, information assurance, and engineering services required to manage risk and maintain information resource protections to support current mission. Principal goals of Risk Management Framework (RMF) are to protect the element's ability to perform its mission, not just its information assets; improve information security; avoid unnecessary and costly duplication of effort; ensure standards and guidelines employ protections; focus on a more holistic and strategic risk management process designed to develop trust across the IC information technology enterprise through the use of common standards and reciprocally accepted assessment and authorization decisions. The RMF steps require the categorization of the information system; the selection of security controls based on the system categorization; the implementation of security controls; the assessment of the security controls to ensure they're working as intended; the authorization of the Information System; and the monitoring of security controls. Networks that may be affected are the AF Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS), AF Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS), National Security Agency (NSA), as well as other SCI and AF ISR environments. Requirement is anticipated for a two year bridging action until a larger advisory and assistance contract can be awarded. Requirement is anticipated to begin late September 2013. Acquisition strategy is to award an IDIQ type vehicle to meet the Government needs during the two year bridging period. Government anticipates issuing a request for proposal around June 2013. IT personnel support must meet the minimum requirements as identified in PWS and DoD 8570.1M "Information Assurance Training, Certification and Workforce Management". Contractor shall have and maintain a final US Government issued Top Secret/ Sensitive Compartmentalized Information (TS/SCI) security clearance with a current National Agency Check (NAC). The contractor shall follow the security requirements outlined in the contract DD Form 254, Department of Defense Security Classification Specifications." The contractor shall be subject to random drug testing. Documents shall be maintained and protected as required by the classification of the information. The contractor shall safeguard Government information as required by Enclosure 3 of DODI 8582.01," Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems."

<CONTACT>Jonathan A. Heitkam, Contracting Officer, Phone 5755721245, Email jonathan.heitkam@holloman.af.mil
<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice pursuant to FAR Part 5. The Department of the Air Force, 846 Test Squadron (846 TS), Holloman AFB, NM, has a requirement for the fabrication of concrete targets for use at the Holloman High Speed Test Track (HHSTT). The work covered by this requirement consists of furnishing all plant, materials, labor, and providing all operations in connection with the construction and demolition of reinforced concrete targets. The contract will be a Requirements IDIQ for one year with four one-year options.<br />The principle objective of this contract is to construct targets in the order required to support planned sled test dates provided in each independent delivery order. Targets will be constructed to the size and strength requirements according to target drawings and free of visual defects. Standard block target thickness will range from less than 1' to 6', and standard block sizes range from 15' x15' to 22' x 22'. Delivery orders will normally have a quantity of targets ranging from 1 to 7 depending on the needs of the tests and cure time. A list of drawings will be included with the solicitation. Contractors must be prepared for quick turnaround targets and high strength targets of 5 KSI, 11 KSI or possibly up to 20 KSI or stronger. On rare occasions the Government may install thermocouple(s) or other instrumentation wire(s) in concrete targets.<br />Concrete strength tests IAW ACI 318-08, CM 31/C31M-06 will be required for each task order (normally 3 per target) to be performed by an independent 3rd party lab recommended by the contractor, but approved by the Government. The contractor will be responsible for providing target strength data.<br />Used targets will be crushed, removed&nbsp;and disposed of in a legal manner by the contrctor.<br />Due to the size and weight of the targets, an area has been set aside near the HHSTT for the contractor's use. The area is approximately 18 miles from the Holloman main base area. Water and electricity are not available at the offered job site. However, water is available at the ARC building approximately 0.5 miles away. The contractor will be responsible for providing any electricity, sanitation, and safety requirements for performance of target construction. The contractor will be responsible for grading/leveling/compacting the existing casting yard area as required to construct targets and repair any lanes disturbed by operations.<br />Due to performance on an Air Force installation, the contractor will be responsible for ensuring all employees working on Holloman AFB meet all security requirements. The Government will not be responsible for delays due to employees denied access due to security requirements.<br />A single award contract is contemplated and will be set-aside for small business. Competitive procedures under FAR 15.101-2 Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection Process will be utilized. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 327390, Other Concrete Product Manufacturing. The associated Small Business Size Standard for NAICS 327390 is 500 employees. <br />The Government anticipates a Requirements Contract utilizing Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed-Fee Contract Line Items. The Government expects to post the solicitation on FedBizOpps on or around 3 May 2013.<br />An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Manager or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommends to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the Contracting Point of Contact identified below. The Ombudsman is Col Douglas W. Jaquish, AFTC/CV, 1 South Rosamond Boulevard, Edwards AFB, CA 93524; phone: (661)277-2810. Collect calls will not be accepted.<br />Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should be addressed to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Jonathan Heitkam, (575)572-1245 or e-mail jonathan.heitkam@holloman.af.mil. No costs will be paid for any charges incurred in responding to this notice.<br />

Award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays and mission failure (see FAR 6.302-1). This extension will allow for continued performance and personnel for interface/transition of critical services while the Government expeditiously re-solicits the requirement as a corrective action to the protest of Contract FA7014-13-C-5000, IT Configuration Management and Control Support, awarded on 14 December 2012. Period of Performance: 6-month base period plus two 2-month options.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award sole source contracts to State Agencies for Egg Inspections.

The final rule, which is codified in 21 CFR 118, will be implemented in a staggered fashion with larger producers (greater than 50,000 layers) required to be in compliance by July 9, 2010 and smaller producers (3,000-49,999 layers) being in compliance by July 9, 2012. It is anticipated that awards will be made for a 12 month contract period to all the producers this fiscal year only. The solicitation will be available on or about May 13, 2013 on the FedBizOpps website at http://fedbizopps.gov. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and amendments.

VNTSC has developed a model (the "CAFE model") to estimate changes to the vehicle fleet due to the CAFE regulations and also estimate the resulting costs and benefits. Currently, the model accounts for changes of such vehicle attributes as engines, transmissions, tires, aerodynamic improvements, and mass reduction. In order to improve the abilities of the CAFE model, additional vehicle attributes need to be studied to understand their costs and effects on vehicle characteristics.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The primary objective of this requirement is to provide support in estimating the production cost of changes to certain vehicle attributes, and determine the extent to which such changes would impact weight, aerodynamic drag, fuel economy, performance (e.g., power/weight), and/or utility (e.g., seating capacity), and to evaluate potential barriers (e.g., sunk costs for tooling, part sharing between platforms, and model refresh/re-design schedules) to application of such changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Such support would include reviewing and analyzing certain documents that contain confidential business or otherwise-protected information.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION<br /></span></strong>This is a pre-solicitation / notice of intent synopsis for a sole source noncompetitive (including brand-name) award to Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC. for the Carl Zeiss Microscopes (LSM 700, Axio Imager, and Axio Observer).<br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) intends to negotiate and award a contract on a sole source noncompetitive basis for the LSM 700, Axio Imager, and Axio Observer to Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC,. One Zeiss Drive, Thornwood, NY 10594.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND<br /></span></strong>The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a program designed to address the needs of persons with debilitating medical conditions for which no diagnosis has been found despite an extensive workup. The goals of the UDP include finding accurate diagnoses and discovering new diseases that provide insight into human physiology and genetics. The unknown nature of these complex diseases requires consultation with various experts from many disciplines internationally.
<p>To aid in the UDP's mission, the UDP requires the purchase of the Zeiss microscopes which will allow the laboratory to examine and design a digital repository of pathology slides obtained from UDP patients, and allow for external consultation in the related field. Additionally, the microscopes will allow for histopathology services for the analysis of patient tissues provided by external and internal clinical laboratories and from model organisms that are required to test hypothesis that arise from clinical or model organism observation. Furthermore, the purchase of these microscopes will allow the UDP laboratory to analyze and characterize subcellular abnormalities and interrogate molecular interactions, and perform quantitative, high-throughput screening methodologies for the detection and confirmation of abnormalities with protein glycosylation and vesicular transport.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br /></span></strong>The delivery period for the microscopes is 13-15 weeks after receipt of the award. The anticipated contract type will be a firm-fixed price contract. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br /></span></strong>The proposed acquisition is is new requirememt.<br /><br />The Axio Imager Upright microscope will be used to view tissue biopsies obtained from UDP patients either prior to or following admission to the NIH CRC for evaluation. The unknown nature of their disease required consultation from experts from many international disciplines. The purchase of this microscope will allow the ability to scan the pathology slides in high-resolution in order to create a digital repository and the formation of a clinical forum in which patient pathology can be discussed among multiple experts. Additionally, this microscope will give the UDP laboratory the capability to provide histopathology services for the analysis of patient tissues and of model organisms.</p>
<p>The Axio Observer Inverted microscope will provide the UDP laboratory the capacity to perform and provide a quantitative, high throughput protocol for detection and confirmation of abnormalities with protein glycosylation and vesicular transport in cultured skin fibroblasts derived from each patient admitted to the NIH CRC. Due to the fact the UDP lab has currently exceeded its capacity of the core facilities, and will be moving to Fishers Lane, the UDP lab must purchase a microscope compatible with the Axiovision and Assaybuilder software that they currently own.<br /><br />The Laser Scanning Confocal microscope, LSM 700, will allow the UDP laboratory the ability to characterize subcellular abnormalities, such as those identified by screens for disorders of protein glycosylation and vesicular transport or by immunohistochemistry in both model organisms and patient cells. The identification of these abnormalities will increase as the screening protocols are uniformly implemented across all UDP patients, and as the generation of high throughput zebrafish mutagenesis and analysis is implemented. Additionally, the LSM confocal microscope will allow the UDP laboratory to interrogate molecular interactions potentially responsible for detected abnormalities identified by implemented proteomic and lipidomic screening. The software required to perform the downstream quantitative analysis is compatible with what the UDP lab has currently developed, and the purchase of a different microscope would require maintenance of an additional operating system, as well as the development of a parallel analysis pipeline.<br /><br />The contractor shall supply all labor, materials, facilities, equipment, and supplies to perform or supply the following: <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quantity</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Catolog No.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Description________________________<br /></strong></span>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4109431007994000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axio Observer Z1 Definite Focus Demo Kit<br />1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4109251865956000&nbsp;&nbsp; LSM 700 URGB (405) 2Ch ZEN 2010 Demo #25<br />1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4109430000992000&nbsp;&nbsp; Axio Imager Z2 Kit<br /><br />Features of each microscope that are required by the UDP laboratory are as follows:</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION:</span></strong>
<p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>
<p><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to RuRo, Inc., 321 Ballenger Center Drive, Suite 102, Frederick, Maryland 21703 to procure LIMS 24/7 Software Platform.</p>
<p>Please see attachments: ISSO Security Language Requirements and 508 Compliance Language. Any modifications to the site will be 508 compliant.<br /><br /><strong>PROCUREMENT</strong>:<br /><br />1. UDP LIMS 24/7 Collaborator License, Quantity: One (1) Perpetual License;<br />2. UDP LIMS 24/7 User Seats, Quantity: Two Hundred and Fifty (250); and<br />3. UDP LIMS 24/7 Module, Quantity: One (1) Each; no shipping and handling charge.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a pilot program designed to address the needs of persons with debilitating medical conditions for which no diagnosis has been found despite an extensive workup. The goals of the UDP include finding accurate diagnoses and discovering new diseases that provide insight into human physiology and genetics. The multi-user nature of NIH's UDP Translational Laboratory, along with its dynamic process structures, engenders a deep set of requirements for any candidate data and project management system.</p>
<p><strong>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</strong>:<br />April 2013 through January 31, 2014</p>
<p><strong>JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p>UDP/NHGRI has been using RuRo Inc. enterprise-grade LIMS 24/7 platform developed by Ruro, Inc. a small business located in Rockville, Maryland since 2012. Ruro assisted NHGRI in establishing Phase 1 and it would be disruptive to allow another source to continue providing these services, as well compatibility issues and administrative time in gaining security access that has already been established by RuRo. The LIMS 24/7 web-based system encompasses project, task and asset management; user role configurability; user-tailored reporting; extensive audit functionality and information security. LIMS 24/7 is designed to be the meeting place of laboratory software tools, laboratory hardware, and staff users, allowing previously impossible levels of secure data access, communication and process efficiency. Additional functionality of a phenotyping engine to the LIMS 24/7 platform will allow for further valuable patient information to be captured and distributed amongst the clinical and scientific staff for developing appropriate research strategies. Ruro, Inc. will provide the Undiagnosed Diseases Program with Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS 24/7), a software platform designed for the simplification and greater efficiency of laboratory sample, data and process management. With this system, Ruro, Inc. will create a method of combining all bioinformatic processes that are used in the Undiagnosed Diseases Program for laboratory and clinical personnel to work collaboratively and efficiently. The Phenotyping management engine that is an additional part of the LIMs 24/7 project will allow the Undiagnosed Diseases Program to have phenotyping functionality within the parameters of the LIMS.</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</strong></p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541511, Custom Computer Programing Services and the Small Business Size Standard is $25.5M. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). The resultant Contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-66 (April 1, 2013). This requirement is under the SAT of $150,000.00.</p>
<p>The determination by the Government to award a purchase order on a sole source on competitive basis for LIMS 24/7 License to RuRo Inc., is a continuation of a previous order [HHSN268201200156P, issued June 1, 2012] issued for Phase 1 of this requirement. Any information received as a result of this pre-solicitation / notice of intent will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct any future competitive procurements. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>

<DESC>This is the NAVSUP Weapon System Support, Annual Synopsis for Year 2 of the Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N0038312G010F with Lockheed Martin Owego.  This is a 3 year BOA.  Lockheed is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of these requirements and is the only known source to possess full repair capability, complete data, drawings and the rights to the attached. This BOA is in support of the MH-60R/S Common Cockpit Suite, the MH-60R Electronic Support Measures Receiver Processor components and the MH-60S Organic Airborne Mine Countermeasure components.  The BOA provides support for all the items in the attached Exhibit A.  
The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.
  Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items will be solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained at https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center intends to make a non-competitive award to the University of California (UCI) Keck-CCAMS Facility for radiocarbon analysis by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) of two sample types:  1) samples containing low-level tracer quantities of 14C; and 2) methane dissolved in pore fluids.  The results of the analysis are to be delivered Woods Hole, Massachusetts by no later than September 1, 2014.
There are no option periods.
UCI is the only known source for this service because it is the only known facility willing to process samples incubated with low-level 14C tracers and also the only facility that extracts methane and CO2 from aqueous samples, separating and converting each to graphite for AMS analysis.
In accordance with FAR 5.207, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency, however, THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
Email responses to dgalvin@usgs.gov.
The anticipated NAICS code is 541380.  The size standard is $14.0 million.
The anticipated award date of the contract is 05/01/2013.  The anticipated contract will be firm fixed-price.  A vendor must be registered at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ to be awarded the contract.

<a href="mailto:lauren.a.mcdermott.civ@mail.mil">ACC - New Jersey</a>
<DESC> <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Center (ACC-NJ-ET) on behalf of Armament Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC) of Ben t Laboratories, Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet, NY, is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources of equipment for measuring and recording time-resolved mass loss information during millisecond (0.5 ms to 10 ms) laser pulse heating. During the laser pulse heating, some materials may lose mass due to thermal degradation and ablation and a system that can measure this mass loss in real-time is desired. The capabilities described below are OBJECTIVE requirements.  It is recognized that a system having all of these capabilities may be impractical, and that some trade-offs may be necessary.  <br>  <br> The OBJECTIVE system shall include: <br>  <br> 1.	Time resolution: <br> The ability to record weight changes of a material with microsecond time resolution. If a laser pulse is 0.5 ms in length, for example, the system would need to collect data on the weight loss of the sample fast enough so that data points could be collected to provide a useful mass loss curve. It is expected that this could be accomplished with 10-50 microsecond resolution or better (objective). <br>  <br> 2.	Mass resolution: <br> The system would need to be able to measure mass changes on the order of 1 microgram (objective), or resolution of 10 micrograms (threshold). The sample will be losing material as a result of being hit by a laser pulse and the effects of this need to be incorporated into the mass measurement. <br>  <br> 3.	Max sample weight <br> It is desired that the system can hold a sample that weighs several grams (objective) with an area on the order of 1 cm2. The system is preferred to not contain any obstructions above the sample. This allows the laser pulse beam to have access to the sample top surface for heating. If absolutely necessary, this could be altered. Allowing the system to be tilted is also a preferred capability. <br>  <br> 4.	Data collection: <br> The system must be able to collect the mass data and transfer the data to a laptop computer where data can be analyzed in mass change vs. time format. <br>  <br> 5.	Triggering: <br> It is desired that the system could be triggered from the laser or function generator to start collecting data (threshold). <br>  <br> 6.	Installation and onsite training services <br>  <br> 7.	Minimum 1 year warranty from installation <br>  <br> This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI). Any information or brochures submitted will be used for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to purchase the mass loss measuring system. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract (see FAR 15.201(e)). No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort.  <br>  <br> Responses: <br>  <br> Interested organizations should submit a company brochure or a tailored capability statement for these requirements that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Responses will be reviewed by Benet Laboratories personnel only and will be held in a confidential manner. Submitted documentation will not be returned. Any and all information provided shall include system specifics including the following: <br>  <br> a. Time resolution <br> b. Mass resolution and information on the maximum weight of sample that can be measured <br> c. Method used to measure the mass change <br> d. Representative mass vs. time data plots <br>  <br> Submission Information: <br>  <br> Responses to the RFI must be received no later than COB 1600 EST on May 17, 2013 via email.  Interested firms should provide their address, point-of-contact with telephone number and e-mail address.

Reclamation, is seeking agricultural planning services to support the development of farm plan alternatives at the San Xavier Cooperative Association (SXCA) located on the San Xavier District Reservation (SXD) of the Tohono O'odham Nation. (Located 8 miles south of Tucson, AZ).  Currently, SXCA farms on part of the land under a lease agreement with the landowners, producing alfalfa, sudan grass, and oat hay.  An additional 1100 acres that are adjacent to the areas currently being farmed have been identified and surveyed for possible development of a farm extension.
Farm plan alternatives shall evaluate potential crops, potential livestock integration, and market opportunities to develop a comprehensive business plan that lays out long term goals and objectives of the full farm while focusing on maintaining the farm's long term sustainability for the benefit of the farm's landowners under a 25 to 40 year lease term.  Additionally, the plan shall evaluate and make recommendations regarding what type of irrigation system(s) should be used for the farm extension that most effectively support the alternatives for the extension. This plan is key to development of the extension in a manner that provides for ongoing operation, maintenance and replacement of the infrastructure and equipment while providing economic benefits to lessees.  Additionally, the farm plan alternatives shall incorporate the values and goals of the SXCA and the O'odham culture in consideration of alternatives and practices being recommended. Current farming practices are consistent with "natural" or "organic" methods with no use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides for both the traditional and large scale crop production.  Ultimately, the business plan will be used to support a new 40 year lease of allotted land covering both the rehab and extension areas.
The contractor will be required to provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials and supervision as needed to perform the effort described including costs associated with but not limited to the following; validity of tests, investigations, market surveys, site surveys, global positioning system surveys, verifying the accuracy and completeness of the agricultural data; assuring the validity of the market analyses and the projected revenues and for assuring the accuracy and completeness of alternative farm layouts and irrigation requirements.

<DESC>Item:	Manufacture of 20MMx102MM Point Detonating (PD), High Explosive (HE) Ammunition
Statement of Need
The Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Indian Head Division (IHD), Picatinny Detachment and the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) are currently seeking sources capable of the manufacture and delivery of 20x102MM Point Detonating (PD), High Explosive (HE) ammunition.  The manufacture of these cartridges includes all components and Load, Assemble and Pack (LAP).

The Navy and Marine Corps are contemplating a future requirement for this item beginning FY16-19. Should such a contract be pursued, the quantities procured would likely be between 100K and 1.5M rounds per year.
This synopsis is issued for informational and planning purposes only.
 It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. This is not a Request for a Proposal (RFP).  The Navy is currently conducting this market survey to locate qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources. The information requested by this RFI will be used within the Navy to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside of the government.  The government does not intend to pay for the information received. 

Item Description/Specification
The Governments performance requirements for this ammunition is not yet fully defined.  Ammunition characteristics that are considered highly desirable are:

	Ballistic Match to current 20MM PGU-series ammunition  The new point detonating round should be a ballistic match to the current 20mm PGU-27, 28, & 30A/B (Target Practice, Semi-Armor Piercing High Explosive Incendiary, Target Practice -Tracer) ammunition.
  This should be able to meet all the ballistic performance requirements of Air Specification AS-6119C.

	Component Match to the current 20MM PGU-series ammunition  The components used to assemble the new point detonating round should utilize, wherever possible, the same components used in the current PGU-28A/B SAPHEI.  The cartridge case, primer, and propellant should be the same as the current PGU-series qualified ammunition.  The Navy recognizes that not all components can be the same when creating a PD/HE versus SAPHEI round.  

	20MM Cartridge will be fuzed to perform as a Point Detonating (PD), High Explosive (HE) cartridge.  The fuze must meet or exceed military standards/specifications for safety and function.
o	Fuze must have low graze sensitivity; provide capability details.
o	Ability to function against soft targets such as .063 aluminum targets

The ammunition must be suitable for Navy Aircraft (NAVAIR) applications and meet the safety requirements for U.S.
 Navy Weapon Systems Explosive Safety Review Board (WSESRB) concurrence for service (NAVSEAINST 8020.6E describes USN policy for WSERB).

The cartridge shall be designed to function (feed, chamber, fire, extract, and download) in the M197 and M61 Vulcan Gun Systems.  The cartridges may be bulk packed with 250 rounds per M548 container or may be linked together with the M14A2N link and packed 100 per M548 container.  

Proposal Requirements
In responding to this Sources Sought, respondents should provide the following information:

	Information on the fuze that will be used to create the PD capability and provide past performance testing, reliability, and safety qualification if available.
  Please provide as much information about the fuze as possible. Examples of additional information to provide if available: specifications, drawings, lot acceptance tests, safety data, performance tests, low graze sensitivity data, etc.

	Past performance manufacturing the requested item or similar items

	A summary of the respondents technical and manufacturing capabilities

	Identification of qualified and unqualified energetic components by name and mass
	Identification of those major components that would be subcontracted 

	A description of the respondents production rate flexibility, including the maximum production rate attainable, and minimum sustaining rate

	A description of the respondents environmental and ballistic test facilities capable of supporting typical ammunition First Article and Lot Acceptance tests

	A description of the respondents quality plan

	A description of the respondents configuration management plan

	A description of the respondents safety plan and does it conform to US Navy Safety Plans and practices (Guiding USN document for System Safety is MIL-STD-882)
	Company size (please identify as either Large, Foreign, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), Woman-Owned Small Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone concern, Veteran-Owned Small Business, or Service-Disabled Small Business)

Method of Delivery
All information must be submitted and received no later than 7 May 2013.
  Any interested source must send information electronically using standard font size to the electronic address and addressee listed below.  Large files need to be compressed using WinZip (http://www.winzip.com). 

All interested sources shall also provide the organization name, address, point of contact, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, taxpayer identification number, DUNS number, and CAGE Code.

Salient Characteristics
1.	Highest rated bursting pressure (RBP) that goes up to 19 ATM, and is the highest of any balloon in the non-fistula class
2.	Smallest crossing profile
3.	Entire balloon is coated, not just the catheter shaft.  (unique to Fox)
4.	Fastest inflate/deflate times.  In some instances  the time of other balloons.  This fact becomes very important when you are performing long angioplasties of arterial lesions, where you do not want excess time of inflation and potential for thrombosis.

<DESC><strong>SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT<br /></strong>Risk Assessment Support<br />
<p><strong><br />Sources Sought Announcement</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement (SSA) to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications relative to NAICS code 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services (size standard of $14.0M). EPA requests demonstration of capability by interested small business firms through submittal of a capability statement.<br /><br />In addition to the SSA, EPA requests all interested parties (whether submitting a capability statement or not) to add their company information to the "Interested Vendors List" tab associated with this notice on FedBizOpps. However, adding a company's name to the interested vendors list only is not sufficient for making a determination on qualified small businesses, therefore you are highly encouraged to submit a capability statement.<br /><br /><strong>Disclaimer<br /></strong><br />This is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NOT</strong></span> a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought announcement only. Responses to this SSA shall not constitute responses to a solicitation. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this SSA are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely the Government's discretion. This SSA is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response. Respondents will not be notified of the results of any government assessments. The information received will be utilized to assist in formulating a strategy for competitive procurements. Electing not to submit a capability statement does not preclude a company from submitting an offer under any resulting solicitation, if a solicitation is issued, nor will it impact the evaluation of an offer that did not submit a capability statement.<br /><br /><strong>Description<br /><br /></strong>The Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (ORCR) is potentially seeking to acquire advisory and assistance type services for providing the contractual support necessary for the assessment of potential risks and other impacts associated with the generation and management of materials originating in households and businesses, industrial process materials and residues, and management of municipal and industrial solid wastes. Services will require the assessment of potential risks, benefits, costs, economic impacts, and other effects associated with the generation and management of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and hazardous substances. The technical support requirements are designed to help ORCR meet resource conservation, protection, and corrective action goals.<br /><br />The existence of potential Organizational conflict of interest (COI) is anticipated; therefore any solicitation, resulting contract or orders under the contract will contain the appropriate COI provisions and clauses. Situations may occur where access to confidential business information (CBI) and/or any other sensitive information is necessary and any solicitation, resulting contract or orders under the contract will contain the appropriate CBI provisions and clauses.<br /><br />Currently, EPA administers one (1) risk assessment support contract. Additional information regarding this requirement can be located in EPA's Forecast Database at: http://yosemite1.epa.gov/oarm/oam/forecastdatabase.nsf</p>
<p>The Government anticipates a single contract award to fulfill this requirement for up to 5 years. The level of effort required on an annual basis under the proposed contract is anticipated to fluctuate based on many independent factors including amount of work required, programmatic budget changes, changes in agency priorities, and activities typically associated with the nature of the services to be provided (e.g. court-ordered deadlines). The Government anticipates a need for the following broadly estimated levels of effort (LOE) per contract year in terms of direct labor hours:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contract Year</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Level of Effort (direct labor hours)</span></strong></p>
<p>Year 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20,000<br />Year 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20,000<br />Year 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20,000<br />Year 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20,000<br />Year 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20,000</p>
<p><strong>Place of Performance</strong></p>
<p>Contractor's facility.</p>
<p><strong>Performance Work Statement</strong></p>
<p>A draft Risk Assessment statement of work (SOW) is attached.</p>
<p><strong>Capability Statement</strong></p>
<p>The Government requests demonstration of capability by small business firms interested in performing this requirement as a prime contractor through submittal of a capability statement. All capability statements shall:</p>
<p>1. Include company name, address, DUNS, phone and principal owners including partners, subcontractors and/or joint venture arrangements.<br />2.

Include specific examples of work previously performed in all task areas described in the draft SOW within the past three years. Experience as a subcontractor, partner, joint venture, or key personnel is considered in the same manner as primary experience. Include reference(s) for each example.<br />5. Include detailed, documented proof of your company's past experience and/or capability to perform all task areas described in the draft SOW at the estimated level of effort for this requirement.<br />6. Demonstrate the management capability, corporate structure, and financial capability to meet the needs of the estimated level of effort and scope of this requirement. Note that any resulting solicitation under set-aside procedures will include FAR 52.219-14 Limitation on Subcontracting.<br />7. Not exceed 10 single-sided pages in length based on font size of no smaller than an 11 point pitch on 8.5" x 11" size pages with margins no less than 1" for the left, right, top and bottom excluding a cover page. Only emailed submissions permitted. The submission shall be a searchable PDF file format (a single file) that can be printed on 8.5" x 11" size paper and free from viruses or password protections. The Government is not responsible for receipt of corrupted files and therefore will not attempt to recover the file.<br />8. The Government will only consider information towards market research that falls within the page limitations/restrictions and disregard the remaining pages.<br />9. Avoid use of excessive marketing lexicon, submission of fancy brochures, unnecessary sales literature, and product puffery.<br />10. What existing contract(s) or source(s) (e.g. GSA, GWACs) is your company on that would support performing the entire services outlined in the draft SOW for the full performance period?</p>
<p><strong>Submission Information</strong></p>
<p>The Government intends to consider all comments and the responsive qualification packages when developing its final acquisition strategy and resulting solicitation. The synopsis, amendments and other information related to this SSA, as well as any subsequent acquisition notifications, will be posted via FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) and the EPA website (www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm). All information related to this acquisition will be available at these sites through the date of any award. All interested parties are encouraged to continue to regularly check these sites for updates. Please provide the above information as a searchable PDF file via <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">email only</span></strong>no later than 3:00 pm ET, May 13, 2013 to Rayna Brown at brown.rayna@epa.gov. Please place "Sources Sought Submission - Risk Assessment Support" in the subject of the email transmission. No faxes, mail, or phone calls will be accepted.</p>
<p><strong>Interested Vendors List</strong></p>
<p>In addition to considering this sources sought announcement, EPA requests all interested parties (whether submitting a capability statement or not) to add their company information to the "Interested Vendors List" tab associated with this notice on FedBizOpps. Primarily, the interested vendors list will be a point of reference for prospective offerors to find teaming partners and potential subcontractors for this requirement. Additionally, the interested vendors list will aid the Government in its market research efforts.</p>
<p>Interested parties can add their company information to the interested vendors list by viewing the synopsis of this sources sought announcement on FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) and clicking on the "Interested Vendors List" tab, then clicking on the "Add Me to Interested Vendors" button at the bottom of the page, and then following the system instructions.</p>

<DESC>I. Description / Purpose:<br />I.1. The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Development Planning (XR) and Weather Systems (WM) Directorates, Los Angeles Air Force Base, California are contemplating the feasibility of industry to support the Hosted Environmental Assessment of LEO Radiation (HEALER) project. This effort seeks to use commercially hosted payloads to deliver timely space weather data to satisfy operational requirements more cost effectively than stand-alone spacecraft. Energetic particle radiation in space can interfere with communications, damage spacecraft, and affect human health. Observing and monitoring space weather in real time is of critical importance to both our defense and national economy. The intent is to quickly and affordably provide the Government the ability to rapidly and accurately assess the impacts of space weather hazards. The Government believes this is possible through hosting at least 25-100 pods of small dosimeters (1-4 dosimeters per pod, one pod per satellite) on commercial hosts scheduled for fielding no later than 2018. A dosimeter is a solid state sensor designed to measure the total dose of energetic particles impacting a silicon detector target. For the purposes of this RFI, the Government has selected a micro-dosimeter designed by The Aerospace Corporation and manufactured under license by Teledyne Microelectronics, Part Number: &micro;DOS-001. The host would be responsible for the integration, test, launch, and operation of this Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).<br />I.2. SMC is issuing this RFI as part of its market research to determine industry's ability to satisfy this requirement. SMC is deeply committed to maximizing commercial hosting opportunities to reduce the time and cost of space access for USAF programs. Consequently, SMC is requesting companies able to meet HEALER requirements to provide information detailing their capabilities and corporate qualifications pertaining to this scope of work. <br />I.3. The Air Force will use the following requirements to determine industry's ability to meet HEALER needs:<br />1) Launch Schedule and Lifecycle- Currently, the Air Force desires the dosimeter pods on orbit in the 2017-2018 timeframe. The Government requires a 15 year operational life of the host to ensure adequate space weather coverage.<br />2) Coverage and Revisit Rate - To meet operational and scientific requirements, the host shall have the ability to provide 100% global coverage with a revisit rate of approximately three hours, for a two degree longitude by thirty degree latitude box. <br />3) Orbit/Altitude - A polar orbit with an inclination of no less than sixty degrees is preferred. Typical LEO altitudes can be accommodated provided the orbit lifetime of the operational system meets the 15 year operational requirement. <br />4) Power: Each host shall have up to 3W of available power. <br />5) Mass: The host shall have up to 3kg of available mass. <br />6) Thermal Conditions - The micro-dosimeter pod requires an operating temperature of -30 C to +40 C and a storage temperature of -40 C to +110 C.<br />7) Telemetry - The micro-dosimeter pod produces telemetry that includes its data once per second when on and requires a transmission rate of 280 bps. The data packet is 35 bytes and includes pod serial number, temperature and ADC reference, 2 micro-dosimeter medium range outputs once per second, 2 micro-dosimeter low range outputs that are sampled once per 100 msec. <br />8) Data Latency - Data latency, the time from collection to being made available to the end user, shall be less than five (5) minutes. <br />9) Launch Vehicle Origin and Launch Location - The HEALER project office is pursuing a waiver to US Transportation Policy requiring US Government payloads to be launched on space launch vehicles manufactured in the US. Therefore, potential hosts using non-US manufactured launch vehicles and locations are considered viable for this RFI.<br />II. White Paper Content: Interested industry respondents are requested to provide a White Paper that includes answers/information with regards to the following questions/requests:<br />II.1 Technical Competency - Discuss your company's ability to satisfy the requirements listed in Section I.3 above. Responses should include a high-level integration and launch schedule, adequate demonstration of the ability to meet coverage and revisit rate requirements, and a high-level CONOPS for ground operations. <br />II.2 Corporate Capabilities - Briefly discuss you company's experience related to projects similar in size, complexity, and scope of HEALER.<br />II.3 Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) Costs - Provide a summary of estimated ROM lifecycle costs by year based on the technical requirements listed in Section I.3 for the full 15 year life. If possible, address Satellite Scarring (hosting NRE), Satellite Integration &amp; Test, Liability Insurance, Hosting Fee, and Operations &amp; Maintenance.<br />II.4 Small Business Participation - Respondents should indicate whether they meet criteria for a small business. Small business criteria are listed in Section IV. All other respondents are asked to provide percentage estimates (small business dollar component divided by estimated total contract value) for nominal small business subcontracting possibilities for the notional HEALER project. The term "nominal" signifies the amount of small business subcontracting the contractor would employ without any requirement or goal being imposed by the Government, i.e., the amount that would generate the most efficiencies for the contractor and the Government.<br />III. Industry Day: An industry day session may be scheduled, based on the results of the RFI. RFI respondents may be invited to participate in supplemental industry day one-on-one discussions with the Government to discuss their White Paper information in greater detail. However, failure to respond to the RFI does not preclude proposal submittal or industry day participation if a formal acquisition is announced.<br />IV. Small Business Consideration: The NAICS code for this project is 541712. The Small Business size standard is: 1,000 employees. The applicable classification code is "A- Research &amp; Development." The Small Business point of contact is Mr. Willard Strozier at 310-653-1108. Participation from small and small disadvantaged businesses is highly encouraged. However, only companies able to meet the stringent schedule and technical requirements as host prime contractors should respond to this RFI.<br />V. White Paper Classification: Respondents shall provide an unclassified response to this RFI. Respondents shall indicate whether their responses contain proprietary information if the respondents wish for the responses to be handled as such.<br />VI. White Paper Format: Responses shall not exceed ten (10) pages. The Government will not consider pages in excess of ten (10) pages. Page size shall be 8.5 x 11; text font size shall be no smaller than 11 pt; font size within graphics and tables shall be no smaller than 8 pt. The White Paper front matter such as transmittal letter, cover page, and table of contents will not count against the page limit. The Government will not accept company literature or marketing materials in response to this RFI.<br />VII. Response Due Date: 1600 PST, 03 May 2013.<br />VIII. Submission Instructions: Submit an electronic copy in either PDF format or Microsoft Word format to Mr. Shelby Sommer, at Shelby.Sommer@us.af.mil by the Response Due Date. Hard copy responses will not be accepted.<br />IX.

<a href="mailto:lisa.j.yamakawa.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Aberdeen Division D</a>
<DESC>I.   This is a special notice in accordance with the Qualification Requirements (FAR 9.2), intended for manufacturers of protective eyewear to support re-establishing the Qualified Product List (QPL) for protective eyewear, from which the Authorized Protective Eyewear List (APEL) is derived.  The APEL provides eye protection for military combat and training in a manner that offers variety/choice of products to best suite mission needs. This announcement will constitute the only notification for QPL establishment. <br>  <br> Any future acquisitions based on the QPL that results from this notice will be in accordance with the FAR and other pertinent Government regulations and requirements at the time of release. <br>  <br> Questions related to this notice shall be submitted in writing to Lisa J. Yamakawa at lisa.j.yamakawa.civ@mail.mil . <br>  <br> The purpose of this notice is to qualify products for the QPL for military combat eye protection.  There is no funding associated with this action.  Based on compliance with the requirements set forth herein, the Government will determine whether each product/proposal meets the needs of the QPL and notify each Offeror accordingly.  Due to the extensive testing involved to qualify a product, the Government estimates it will take approximately 10 months to complete the qualification process and inform Offeror's of the status of their submissions.  All Offerors shall be required to provide test data from an independent third party test laboratory approved by the Government.  Third party test labs that have been approved by the Government for QPL testing are COLTS laboratories and ICS laboratories. Testing conducted with Government funds will be at a laboratory of the Government's choice.  The Government intends to use data/feedback from Military Users to determine acceptability of products for military use in the field in accordance with  MIL-PRF-32432.  Successful products will be added to the QPL and be eligible for future procurement until such time that the QPL is no longer used by the Government or the product(s) is removed from the QPL.  Initial listing applies only to products that use the same processes, materials and facilities as those used to produce the sample submissions in response to this notice.  Once listed, any future changes to product design, processes, materials or facilities shall be submitted in writing to the Government for approval through an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) process along with supporting test data from an independent laboratory.  All ECPs shall include projected date of implementation.  Listing on the QPL does not guarantee acceptance of the product in any future purchase. (Reference  quote mark Provisions Governing Qualification:  Qualified Products List and Qualified Manfuacturers Lists quote mark , available at http://www.assistdocs.com), for additional information).   <br>  <br> Once the QPL is re-established, periodic requests for new candidate submissions may be made and advertised to industry in FedBiz Ops and/or by other suitable means, and evaluated accordingly.  Offerors are advised that minor Performance Specification changes, such as adjustments to product color to reflect changes in fielded military camouflage colors and patterns, may also be made periodically to remain current with military needs and advancements in technology.  Such changes will be advertised to industry, along with a designated period for compliance, by suitable means to ensure all potential Offerors are informed simultaneously.  Though Offerors are not under any obligation to modify their products to maintain compliance with specification changes, Offerors are cautioned that QPL products that no longer meet the Government's requirements/needs may be removed from the QPL.   <br>  <br> Offerors are encouraged to submit their best value product solutions to the Government.   QPL submissions and subsequent listings are being restricted to no more than 3 spectacles, and no more than 3 goggles (to include hybrid goggles) per Offeror.  Different MIL-PRF-32432 shades or sizes of the same product are not considered to be separate product solutions for the purposes of this QPL; the same product available in multiple MIL-PRF-32432 shades or sizes will be counted as one product.   A product kit configuration proposed with all components necessary to qualify the product under more than one class of eyewear (as both Class 1 and Class 1a, for example) will also be counted as one product if supporting test data is provided for each class with which the product complies.   <br>  <br> Upon acceptance of the product for listing on the QPL, Offerors shall supply a configuration management package (to include drawings with critical item dimensions, material used to produce each component, lens coatings used, and source of manufacturing) within 30 days of notification by the Government for the products proposed and accepted for QPL listing.  All information considered proprietary shall be marked  quote mark These data are considered by the supplier to be submitted in confidence and furnished for the purpose of facilitating qualification testing.  These data are not to be disclosed outside the Government nor to be duplicated, used, or disclosed in whole or in part, for any purpose other than to evaluate the product submitted for qualification testing.  This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in such data if it is obtained from another source. quote mark  Upon written notice by the Government, the  quote mark APEL quote mark  logo and certification sticker shall be applied to any product intended for the US military once  that particular product is listed on the APEL, in accordance with specification requirements.  Only APEL products using the same processes, materials and facilities as those certified may bear the APEL logo and certification sticker.  Offerors with products listed on the APEL shall abide by the requirements of this notice and the  quote mark Provisions Governing Qualification:  Qualified Products List and Qualified Manfuacturers Lists quote mark  (available at http://www.assistdocs.com).   <br>  <br> II.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Negotiate on a Sole Source Basis
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Computer Sciences Corporation(CSC) to provide the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP) with continued support services. Specifically, the goal of this negotiation is to convert the work currently being performed under a Time and Materials vehicle&nbsp; to a hybrid cost plus fixed fee/fixed price contract. The revised requirement will complete the remaining period of performance with a 3 month base, two one year options, and a 7 month option with an end date of April 2016 (The end of current legislation).</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide health care program management, call center, and claims processing support services related to requirements implemented by the Zadroga Act, which was signed into law on January 2, 2011. The current requirement include:</p>
<p>- Program Management, Data Management, Analytics, Decision Support, and Reporting Services.</p>
<p>- Medical, and Pharmacy Benefits Management</p>
<p>- Claims System Operations and Maintenance</p>
<p>- Medical and Pharmacy Call Center Operations</p>
<p>- ICD 10 Software Enhancements</p>
<p>CDC believes that CSC, with its experience in working the current contract, is uniquely qualified to meet the requirements mandated by the Zadroga Act and is the only responsible source because it possesses the resources and personnel to provide continued support of the World Trade Center Health Program and implement support without delay or risk to performance. Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the current requirements would occur as a result of re-competing this procurement, and there would be substantial duplication of cost that could not be recovered through competition. This duplication of cost would include a transition period of at least six months. During this transition period a new contractor would need to establish and implement systems to perform the above referenced activities. This includes development of new claims processing systems and procedures, as well as the establishment of a pharmacy benefits program. Under present legislation, this program is not funding beyond 2016.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. No solicitation document exists for this requirement. However, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement must submit technical and pricing documentation sufficient to determine capability in providing the same or similar support. This documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of the electronic posting of this notice. Telephone requests will not be honored. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the CDC. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. <br />The anticipated award date is June 15, 2013.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information -  Thermally Initiated Venting System (TIVS) Technologies

Description:
1.	This is a special notice open to U.S. industry and academia requesting information on technologies pertaining to Thermally Initiated Venting System (TIVS) technologies. The Sidewinder Program Office of the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) is interested in reviewing TIVS technologies, in both the concept and development phases, which will mitigate the reaction violence of both slow cookoff (SCO) and fast cookoff (FCO) of solid rocket motors. The notional initiation requirement for SCO is near 350F after duration of exposure pertinent to the SCO environment and for FCO is near 550F after duration of exposure pertinent to a FCO environment.
 This RFI includes both mechanical and electrical TIVS technologies.

2.	Objective: Identify TIVS technologies to meet Insensitive Munitions (IM) goals for Type V (burning) reactions in both SCO and FCO without initiating the rocket motor propellant. The major TIVS functions include the thermal sensor, trigger, initiator, transfer energetic and highly reproducible linear shaped charge to score the rocket motor case, but not initiate the contained energetic (explosive or propellant). Features of TIVS technologies that are of particular interest include, but are not limited to: 
2.1.	Mechanical TIVS devices that have no single point of failure.
2.2.	Electronic TIVS devices which are self-powered and tunable for multiple temperatures.
 
2.3.	Technologies that address not only performance and overall packaging concerns, but also affordability.
2.4.	TIVS devices that lock-out upon missile acceleration of approximately 10 gs, as well as a simple method to reset the device in the field.
2.5.	TIVS devices that provide visual indications of a) armed condition, b) initiated condition, c) locked-out condition.
2.6.	TIVS thermal sensor/trigger devices less than 1 lbm and a volume less than 1.5 in3.
2.7.	TIVS devices that provide a means to be readily replaceable in the field. 
3.	Background: In order to satisfy IM requirements TIVS devices have been fielded on some missile systems, but are expected to become more prevalent. Future TIVS systems must be in compliance with MIL-STD-1901A.
 Concepts have to be implemented within volume constraints of missile systems and contain sufficient safety logic to avoid inadvertent failure modes.
4.	Information Desired:
4.1.	Points of Failure: For safety concerns, no single point of failure mode is acceptable. Information is desired on the failure modes applicable to TIVS technologies and the final state the technology would be in after a failure.
4.2.	Electronics TIVS power supply: In electronic TIVS systems, an on-board power supply/thermal battery may be required and must be able to maintain a long shelf life and maintain TIVS operational reliability. Information is desired on the power supply/thermal battery for electronic TIVS technologies.
4.3.	High temperature electronic and mechanical components:  Information is desired on any electronic components inherent to the TIVS technology and how to mitigate the risk of failure modes at elevated temperatures.
 Information is also desired on the role of elevated temperature on any mechanical TIVS technology.
4.4.	Safety Logic: Information is desired on the safety logic for TIVS technologies including but not limited to lockout at a desired g-limit, lockout to avoid inadvertent aeroheating or bomb-bay thermal conditions, and any visual indication of function lockout.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Caribbean Healthcare System, San Juan, Puerto Rico intends to negotiate a commercial (FAR Part 12)  Sole Source contract with  Environmental Health & Safety Services, CARR. 2 KM. 39.7, BO. Algarrobo, Vega Baja, PR, 00693-4427 in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Only one Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Government anticipates that the program requirement will be fulfilled via a Firm Fixed Price contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 16.202.

Services Description:

The VA Caribbean Healthcare System (VACHS) will employ an independent professional industrial hygienist (VPIH) consultant to perform various services during asbestos abatement projects on behalf of the VA. The VPIH will perform the necessary monitoring, inspection, testing and other support services to ensure that VA patients, employees, and visitors will not be adversely affected by the abatement work, and that the abatement work proceeds in accordance with asbestos abatement specifications.
       
VA Professional Industrial Hygienist (VPIH) and Industrial Hygiene Technician (IHT) Requirements:

The VPIH must meet the definition requirements of the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Professional IH and the definition requirements of  OSHA as a "Competent Person" under 29 CFR 1926.58(b); has completed two specialized EPA approved courses on management and supervision of asbestos abatement projects; has completed formal training in respiratory protection and waste disposal; has performed as IH in a minimum of four (4) asbestos abatement projects of which in at least three (3) has served as the supervisory IH; and has all required state and local licenses and permits.

The Industrial Hygiene Technician (IHT) shall be trained and have specialized field experience in air sampling and analysis. Technician must have completed a NIOSH 582 course or equivalent and show proof and must participate in the AIHA Asbestos Analysis Registry for fiber counting quality control assurance. The IHT must also be an accredited EPA/State Supervisor and Building Inspector. Technician must have performed duties of principal assistant to a Professional IH in at least five (5) asbestos abatement projects.

Abatement Inspection and Certification Services:

The VPIH will oversee the project to assure quality, resolve problems, prevent the spread of contamination beyond the regulated area and assure clearance at the end of the project. He or she will perform the final inspection and testing to determine whether the regulated area or building has been adequately decontaminated. All air monitoring are to be done utilizing Phase Contrast Microscopy (PCM)/Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).

The VPIH will perform the following tasks:

Establish background levels before abatement begins by collecting background samples.  Samples must be retained for possible TEM analysis.

Inspect the regulated area prior to the commencement of abatement operations to ensure that abatement specifications requirements such as the following are met: enclosure integrity, location of personnel and equipment decontamination facilities, location of negative pressure machine(s), HEPA filtration, continuous pressure differential of -0.02 in wg, etc. 

Perform continuous air monitoring, inspection and testing outside the regulated area during actual abatement work to detect any faults in the regulated area isolation and any adverse impact of surroundings from regulated area activities.  Air samples must be analyzed on-site and results must be provided to the VA Representative the same day or at the beginning of the next working day (if abatement is conducted after working hours).
    
Perform unannounced visits to spot check overall compliance of work with contract/specifications. These visits may include any inspection, monitoring and testing inside and outside the regulated area and all aspects of the operation except personnel monitoring.

Provide support to the VA Facility representative such as evaluation of submittals from the Contractor, resolution of conflicts, interpretation of data, etc.

Perform, in the presence of the VA Facility representative, final inspection and testing of the decontaminated regulated area at the conclusion of the abatement to certify compliance with all the regulations and VA requirements/specifications. Final clearance air samples will be collected and analyzed in accordance with procedures outlined by AHERA. If work is less than 260 linear feet (lf)/160 square feet (sf), five (5) PCM samples may be collected for clearance. If work is equal to or more than 260 lf/160 sf, TEM sampling shall be done for clearance.

Issue a certificate of decontamination for each regulated area. 

The monitoring and inspection results of the VPIH will  be used by VACHS to issue any stop removal orders to the Contractor during abatement work and to accept or reject a regulated area or building as decontaminated.

The VPIH will make available to VACHS IH and Project Manager the plan for samples collection and analysis for the continuous monitoring outside and inside the regulated area and the plan for the final inspection and testing for each space prior to executing each plan.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Caribbean Healthcare System, San Juan, Puerto Rico intends to negotiate a commercial (FAR Part 12)  Sole Source contract with  Environmental Health & Safety Services, CARR. 2 KM. 39.7, BO. Algarrobo, Vega Baja, PR, 00693-4427 in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Only one Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Government anticipates that the program requirement will be fulfilled via a Firm Fixed Price contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 16.202.

Services Description:

The VA Caribbean Healthcare System (VACHS) will employ an independent professional industrial hygienist (VPIH) consultant to perform various services during asbestos abatement projects on behalf of the VA. The VPIH will perform the necessary monitoring, inspection, testing and other support services to ensure that VA patients, employees, and visitors will not be adversely affected by the abatement work, and that the abatement work proceeds in accordance with asbestos abatement specifications.
       
VA Professional Industrial Hygienist (VPIH) and Industrial Hygiene Technician (IHT) Requirements:

The VPIH must meet the definition requirements of the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Professional IH and the definition requirements of  OSHA as a "Competent Person" under 29 CFR 1926.58(b); has completed two specialized EPA approved courses on management and supervision of asbestos abatement projects; has completed formal training in respiratory protection and waste disposal; has performed as IH in a minimum of four (4) asbestos abatement projects of which in at least three (3) has served as the supervisory IH; and has all required state and local licenses and permits.

The Industrial Hygiene Technician (IHT) shall be trained and have specialized field experience in air sampling and analysis. Technician must have completed a NIOSH 582 course or equivalent and show proof and must participate in the AIHA Asbestos Analysis Registry for fiber counting quality control assurance. The IHT must also be an accredited EPA/State Supervisor and Building Inspector. Technician must have performed duties of principal assistant to a Professional IH in at least five (5) asbestos abatement projects.

Abatement Inspection and Certification Services:

The VPIH will oversee the project to assure quality, resolve problems, prevent the spread of contamination beyond the regulated area and assure clearance at the end of the project. He or she will perform the final inspection and testing to determine whether the regulated area or building has been adequately decontaminated. All air monitoring are to be done utilizing Phase Contrast Microscopy (PCM)/Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).

The VPIH will perform the following tasks:

Establish background levels before abatement begins by collecting background samples.  Samples must be retained for possible TEM analysis.

Inspect the regulated area prior to the commencement of abatement operations to ensure that abatement specifications requirements such as the following are met: enclosure integrity, location of personnel and equipment decontamination facilities, location of negative pressure machine(s), HEPA filtration, continuous pressure differential of -0.02 in wg, etc. 

Perform continuous air monitoring, inspection and testing outside the regulated area during actual abatement work to detect any faults in the regulated area isolation and any adverse impact of surroundings from regulated area activities.  Air samples must be analyzed on-site and results must be provided to the VA Representative the same day or at the beginning of the next working day (if abatement is conducted after working hours).
    
Perform unannounced visits to spot check overall compliance of work with contract/specifications. These visits may include any inspection, monitoring and testing inside and outside the regulated area and all aspects of the operation except personnel monitoring.

Provide support to the VA Facility representative such as evaluation of submittals from the Contractor, resolution of conflicts, interpretation of data, etc.

Perform, in the presence of the VA Facility representative, final inspection and testing of the decontaminated regulated area at the conclusion of the abatement to certify compliance with all the regulations and VA requirements/specifications. Final clearance air samples will be collected and analyzed in accordance with procedures outlined by AHERA. If work is less than 260 linear feet (lf)/160 square feet (sf), five (5) PCM samples may be collected for clearance. If work is equal to or more than 260 lf/160 sf, TEM sampling shall be done for clearance.

Issue a certificate of decontamination for each regulated area. 

The monitoring and inspection results of the VPIH will  be used by VACHS to issue any stop removal orders to the Contractor during abatement work and to accept or reject a regulated area or building as decontaminated.

The VPIH will make available to VACHS IH and Project Manager the plan for samples collection and analysis for the continuous monitoring outside and inside the regulated area and the plan for the final inspection and testing for each space prior to executing each plan. The plan will include location for samples, name and qualification of person taking samples, methodology of analysis, laboratory information and qualification of the on-site analyst. 

Laboratory Services:

IHTs performing on-site analysis of PCM samples must be board approved AIHA Asbestos Analyst Registry (AAR) analysts and must belong to an ARR approved organization. 

Samples analyzed by TEM shall be analyzed by an accredited laboratory.

Laboratory must be able to provide twenty-four hour turn-a-round time for air and/or bulk sample results.

<p>Malm. I-3 WAWF Instructions<br />To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred"E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments.</p>
<p>To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact.</p>
<p>For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988.</p>

<p>Billing: Invoices are submitted in arrears for services rendered. A record of the service with a description of time, efforts, serial number, model, and any non-consumables supplied shall be provided with the invoice. CLINs 1, 2, and 3 are used for the on-call services and repairs for model categories. CLIN 4 is used for the semi-annual preventative maintenance (PM) for all models.<br />Explanation of billing per above line items: Quantity would be "1" for an on-call; Monetary Value represents the cost of that visit multiplied by $1.00. The total amount is your estimated amount for 1 year of on-call services and repairs.<br />Example: Qty=1, Unit=$250.00 Unit Price = $1.00. If the amount total was $3,000.00, then: $3,000.00 minus $250.00 would be used for payment leaving $2,700.00 for future calls. The on-calls are drawing down the allocated funding. Please use industry knowledge to estimate the yearly on-call requirement.<br />For the semi-annual maintenance, estimate the total costs for two (2) visits to cover the six (6) machines per visit. The first maintenance would be a Qty of 1@ unit price; the second visit would be the same reducing that total to zero.</p>

<p><br />DFAS 52.223-9000, "ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE PRODUCTS" (June 2012)</p>
<p>The Environmentally Preferable Products clause is included in this contract to articulate the Government's policies on Green Contracting. FAR 23.403 sets forth the Federal Government's policy to acquire items composed of the highest percentage of recycled-content practical, in a cost effective manner while still obtaining other contracting goals. Recycled-content products are identified in the Environmental Protection Agency's Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines (CPGs). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be producing a similar list which designates Bio-based products. EPA guideline items (and USDA designated bio-based products, when designated) are seen as the minimum that should be considered when evaluating environmentally preferable materials. Other environmentally preferable materials and products not listed, but commonly used in industry outside of the Government, should also be considered.</p>
<p>Executive Order 13423 (January 24, 2007) required federal agencies to use sustainable environmental practices, including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products. Moreover, it required that paper of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content must be acquired or used in Agency acquisitions of goods and services.</p>
<p>Executive Order 13514 (October 5, 2009), required federal agencies to analyze internal processes and revise reporting requirements in order to achieve such results as improvement of water use and efficiency, promoting pollution prevention and elimination of waste. But more particularly as related to procurement, an emphasis was placed on efforts to advance sustainable acquisitions to ensure that 95 percent of new contract actions including task and delivery orders, for products and services with the exception of acquisition of weapon systems, are energy-efficient (Energy Star or Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) designated), water-efficient, bio-based, environmentally preferable (e.g., Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) certified), non-ozone depleting, contain recycled content, or are non-toxic or less-toxic alternatives, where such products and services meet agency performance requirements.</p>
<p>&sect; 1. Mandatory Use of Paper and Other Products with Recycled Content.<br />(a) All paper utilized in the performance of this contract must be of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content.<br />(b) The contractor, by responding to this solicitation, affirmatively acknowledges that it will, to the maximum extent practicable, use sustainable environmental practices including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products in the performance of this contract that meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items, which are found at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm. In addition, by responding to this solicitation the contractor is certifying the deliverables required under this contract shall meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items.</p>
<p>&sect; 2 Notice of Green Alternatives in Offerors' Product/Service.<br />(a) When offering a product or service that contains "Green" components as that term is defined at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm, the contractor shall make the Contracting Officer aware of such facts in the submission of their quote or proposal. <br />(b) The contractor, when appropriate, shall comply with FAR Clause 52.223-9 Estimate of Percentage of Recovered Material Content for EPA Designated Products.</p>
<p><br />&sect; 2 Affirmative Duty of Contractors to Adhere to Green Contracting Policy. <br />(a) Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to examine its packaging to eliminate or reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable material for non-recyclable material in packaging.<br />(b) Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to find other materials utilized in the delivery of services under this contract and examine whether it can reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable materials for non-recyclable materials of items consumed in the furnishing of their services. <br />52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999)</p>
<p>The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within the period up to 14 days prior to the contract's expiration.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. (Mar 2000)<br />(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within the period up to 14 days prior to the contract's expiration; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 15 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.<br />(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.<br />(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed five (5) years.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p><br />DFAS 52.204-9000 "REPLACEMENT OF PAPER DOCUMENT DISTRIBUTION WITH ELECTRONIC DOCUMENT ACCESS (EDA)" (June 2012) <br />Copies of DFAS contracts and modifications are available on the Electronic Document Access (EDA) website at http://eda.ogden.disa.mil. The website provides access information as well as EDA Help Desk Support. (END OF CLAUSE)</p>

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

In addition, all other electronic data will be provided to the Forest Service via CD/DVD/flash drive or other appropriate electronic media. Stream flow measurements will be made to USGS standards, to the extent allowed by stream flow and channel characteristics.<br />&bull; If reporting is required by an order/call, it will be prepared in draft form by the contractor. The Forest Service will review and return the report to the contractor for finalization. It will entail the analysis of field data using 2D/3D hydro/habitat models to estimate the relationship between available habitat and discharge for the site. The target species and life stages of interest will be identified by the Forest service. The technical report will detail data collection methods, site characteristics, summary of habitat mapping habitat mapping, and flow to habitat relationships.<br />&bull; Any model(s)/modeling used for the analysis and needed for the running or rerunning of the data will need to be provided to the Forest Service.</p>

<p>In addition, Contractors shall provide the following:<br />1. Complete and sign the Declaration for Federal Employment - Optional Form 306.<br />2. Complete and sign Addendum to Declaration for Federal Employment (OF306).<br />Contractors intending to conduct business with the Federal Government must register with the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award. The System for Award Management (SAM) is combining federal procurement systems and the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance into one new system. This consolidation is being done in phases. The first phase of SAM includes the functionality from the following systems: Central Contractor Registry (CCR), Federal Agency Registration (Fedreg), Online Representations and Certifications Application, and Excluded Parties List System (EPLS). <br />For SAM Customer Service, contact: Federal Service Desk<br />URL: www.fsd.gov<br />Hours: 8am - 8pm (Eastern Time)<br />US Calls: 866-606-8220<br />International Calls: 334-206-7828<br />DSN: 866-606-8220<br />Acceptance Period:</p>
<p>"Due to the Continuing Resolution, funds are presently available through April 26, 2013 (H.J. RES.117). The Government's obligation for performance of this contract beyond that date is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise for performance under this contract beyond April 26, 2013. If funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for performance beyond the above cited date, the Contractor will receive notification in writing by the Contracting Officer."</p>
<p><br />SECURITY CLEARANCE:</p>
<p>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Indian Health Service utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the EQIP entry to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract. Computers have been provided to the service unit for this purpose.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.  Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.  Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.   Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.  If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).  The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document.  The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level.  The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.  Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.   Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.  If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.

The evaluation did not include the Kansas City Plant (the Plant) or its employees, but only those who worked at GSA or a tenant agency other than the Plant. </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></span></p>

Subsequent chest x-rays in 1989 and 1990 also identified pleural changes. GSA retained a different physician to review chest x-rays, and in 1991, the complainant's reading was normal. Four other Maintenance and Operations employees also had positive readings between 1988 and 1990, and negative readings in 1991.</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">(4) Complainant contends that GSA failed to comply with Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration regulations contained in Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, when it accepted the negative findings in the 1991 chest x-rays. He asserts that the abrupt change in findings was the result of the GSA's failure to use an appropriately classified radiologist as required by 29 CFR 1910.1001, Appendix E, and an attempt to negate prior findings indicating the health consequences of exposure to asbestos, beryllium or other toxins. After complainant challenged the 1991 findings, the doctor reading the chest x-rays reviewed his films again and qualified the negative finding, asserting that fat deposits may have caused the pleural changes. Subsequent x-rays in 1992, 1993 and 1994 reflected the positive findings previously identified. </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></span></p>

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">(6) Complainant asserts that current GSA Maintenance and Operations employees are not currently being offered medical monitoring following exposure to asbestos as required by 29 CFR 1926.1101. He stated that employees have been offered only annual pulmonary function tests, rather than the comprehensive physical examinations required by Part 1926.</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">(7) Complainant and approximately 40 other Maintenance and Operations employees worked at the Plant while employed by GSA. These employees worked extensively in the fan rooms, both in the Plant and on the GSA-controlled portion of the site, physically changing large roll filters that captured contaminants. Complainant explains that he worked in fan rooms that were common to both the GSA-controlled portion of the Complex and the Plant. All of the fan rooms at GSA drew outside air into the building from nearby ventilation stacks from the Plant. In addition, Complainant reports that water from the DOE-controlled portion of the site traveled to the GSA-controlled portion, and he and other Maintenance and Operations employees were responsible for pipe repairs occasioned by the breaks or leaks on the DOE-controlled portion of the site.</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></span></p>

The sewage systems for the GSA-controlled portion of the site and the Plant were shared, at least at the level of the pits to which all sewage flowed before being pumped up and out of the facility. Thus, contaminants disposed of at the Plant, including, for example, the chemical residue from barrel- washing operations, were washed into common pits, which were then pumped to the street level. When a sewage back-up occurred, potentially contaminated sewage was released into the GSA-controlled side.</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></span></p>

Such actions include notifying employees of the potential for exposure, and providing a medical surveillance program for all employees who were exposed at or above a permissible exposure limit.</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">(10) In contrast to the comprehensive medical surveillance program in place for DOE employees and former employees who worked at the Plant, GSA has not established a comprehensive medical monitoring program for its own employees. Nor are GSA employees who worked at the Plant recognized as a Special Cohort eligible for compensation for illness caused by their employment under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation program, despite their exposure to the same contaminants that affected Plant employees. Many of the Maintenance and Operations employees who worked at the Plant have since died.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />(11) &nbsp;None of the investigations, audits, or evaluations performed by GSA, DOE, and NIOSH examined the potential exposures of GSA employees who performed work at the Plant. The GSA OIG investigation found that "...prior to 2010, [GSA] did not have a strong environmental management program for the Complex," and "without a comprehensive historical perspective, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that occupants at the Complex were not exposed to hazardous toxins." The GSA OIG review concentrated on the time period 1999 through 2010. No historical review or investigation of employee health hazards has been completed for the time period prior to 1999. Complainant asserts that such a review is necessary in order to establish the exposures GSA employees may have experienced as a result of the cross-contamination from the Plant, as well as from working on Plant equipment on DOE-controlled property.</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></span></p>

5.0 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

The NVWG Event Schedule is critical to the success of the event to serve the Veterans.  Coordinating the events and activities for up to 550 disabled Veterans with wheelchairs as their primary mobility is a momentous challenge.   The fabric to keeping it going is the transportation schedule; keeping the buses moving is key.  

Since wheelchairs will be of different widths and lengths, a full size city bus is needed to accommodate the various sizes allowing for a center aisle to allow ambulatory volunteers to strap in the chairs.  If the load/ unload time is not expeditious, then the transportation will not be consistent or effective.  This will impact the start and finish of the events and the worst possible potential is that a Veteran could be disqualified or not able to participate because they missed their event.  Because of this, we need busses that can load and unload at many different locations requiring them to be self-contained with a fold out or mechanical ramp and in most cases a kneeling mechanism or its equivalent.  
Based on experience of previous games, it has been determined that low-floor busses are essential to meet the needs of the NVWG and that twenty (20) are needed for these games.   Low floor buses are self-contained and take about a minute to position and 1-2 minutes per Veteran to load/unload.  The use of hydraulic lifts on the buses are not practical since they are not manufactured to handle the daily volume needed for this program and in some cases the chair is too wide or heavy to safely fit on a lift.  In addition, the time involved in the use of the lift takes at a minimum 5 - 10 minutes per Veteran depending on the size of the chair and ability of the Veteran to drive their chair in a cramped/tight space.  

6.0 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE / HOURS OF OPERATION

The primary location where contractor will be required to work is the Tampa Convention Center located at 333 S. Franklin Street, Tampa, FL, 33602.

The contractor's personnel will require proper identification at all times.  Contractor shall be required to comply with all security and personnel identification processes expected by the facility.

The Contractor shall not be relieved of its obligations to make timely deliveries or be entitled to any other adjustment because of failure of the Contractor and its associate to promptly refer matters to the CO or because of failure to implement CO directions.</p>
<p>Where the Contractor and Associate Contractors are required to collaborate to deliver a service; the Government will designate, in writing and prior to the definition of the task, to both Contractors, a "lead Contractor" for the project.

<p>The Contractor shall ensure that all of its employees working on this contract are informed of the substance of this clause. Nothing in this special contract requirement shall limit the Government's rights in any way under any other term of the contract, including those related to the Government's right to inspect and accept the services to be performed under this contract.

<p>&bull; Discuss with unauthorized persons any information obtained in the performance of work under this contract.<br />&bull; Conduct business not directly related to this contract on Government premises.<br />&bull; Use computer systems and/or other Government facilities for company or personal business other than work related; or<br />&bull; Recruit on Government premises or otherwise act to disrupt official Government business.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Upon 					request the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. Also the full 					text of a 	clause may be accessed electronically at this address 							http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm

Wherever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", ?vendor? or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. <BR> <BR>Quotes will be evaluated based on price and delivery.  Price is the most important factor. <BR> <BR>In order to enhance the efficiency of the procurement process, the Government intends to evaluate only the lowest priced quote to determine if the quote is technically acceptable and whether the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance.  If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable and the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance, the Government intends to make an award to that vendor and no other quote will be evaluated.  If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability.  Quoter certifies that the product quoted meets or exceeds all minimum requirements as stated in the Request for Quotes. <BR> <BR>Quotes will be evaluated based on _____, ______, and ____.  Past Performance Information may be required to be submitted. <BR> <BR>Procedures for commercial vehicle access to military installations are varied.   To enter the installation, the Contractor should thoroughly comply with the access procedures of a respective installation. The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the access procedures enforced by each military installation.  The Contractor shall completely coordinate with the military installations and the delivery point of contacts. <BR> <BR>The Contractor will appoint an IMO to be the liaison between the Contractor and Government communication personnel.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.

The contracts will not include pre-negotiated line item pricing (except for assorted hourly rates), as projects within this dollar range could have significant variances in unit price values based on the size of the individual project. Rather, each project will be competed among the awardees of the IDIQ contract using criteria established by the ordering office (price alone, or a combination of price and technical factors). This contract vehicle may be utilized by both Regional and Field Office personnel. All awardees under the IDIQ contract will be presented with a fair opportunity to be considered for each order exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. It is anticipated that no less than three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts will be awarded under this solicitation, although the government reserves the right to award a number of contracts outside this range.</span></p>

Task orders may also be placed outside this dollar range if it is in the best interest of the government to do so; however, awardees have the option to decline any RFP's in this case. Utilizing a multiple award IDIQ will maximize competition, as all awardees will compete for each task order, resulting in favorable competitive pricing for GSA.</span></p>

<DESC>The estimated posting date for the full solicitation is hereby updated from 4/22/13 to 4/25/13. <strong>The new esimated release date for the full solicitation is 4/25/13.<br /></strong><br />The esimated posting date for the full solicitation is hereby updated from&nbsp; 04/12/13 - 04/15/13, to 04/22/13. <strong>The new estimated release date for the full solicitation is 4/22/13.<br /></strong><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Information - <br /><br /></span>The RRB is seeking a single contractor who can provide consultative medical exam services and /or ancillary tests used as supportive evidence in making a determination of disability under federal guidelines, for either a current or former railroad employee or his&rsquo; or hers&rsquo; widow(er) or child.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overview - <br /><br /></span>The disability program, administered by the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), is mandated by the Railroad Retirement Act (RR Act). When the disability decision is rendered by the RRB that decision is based on the regulations as cited in the current edition of 20 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Employees' Benefits, Part 220. <br /><br />The nationwide program consists of the following:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <br /></span>
<p><br />&bull; initial determinations of disability, which may result in monthly annuity payments;</p>
<p>&bull; "disability freeze" determinations, which may result in, among other things, early Medicare coverage;</p>
<p>&bull; continuing disability review (CDR) activity, which determines continuing entitlement to disability benefits; and</p>
<p>&bull; an appeals process, which affords any applicant who disagrees with a disability determination rendered by the RRB an opportunity for administrative review.</p>
<p>Consultative examinations and/or ancillary tests are used as supportive evidence in making a determination of disability under Federal guidelines for either a current or former railroad employee or his/her widow(er) or child.<br /><br />The primary emphasis in disability claims processing is not on treatment, but rather on identifying the functional limitations that may interfere with the claimant's ability to work. Therefore, the consultative examination and report must be in sufficient detail to permit the claims examiner and/or evaluating physician - who do not see or examine the applicant - to determine the severity and duration of the impairment. This determination is made within set guidelines that require that objective medical findings be documented in a detailed manner and with the use of specific testing procedures. These manners and procedures are governed by regulations. Alternative testing methods and procedures shall not be used in the disability determination. The types of examinations and tests the RRB will order depend upon the evidence needed for the disability determination. The RRB will order only the specific examinations or ancillary tests needed. If an ancillary test such as an X-ray, blood study, or EKG will furnish the additional evidence needed for the disability determination, a more comprehensive medical examination&nbsp;will not be&nbsp;ordered.</p>
<p>The solicitation will outline a program whereby ordered consultative examinations will be furnished by a contractor who shall establish and maintain systems and procedures necessary to provide consistent quality, timely response and adequate control. Cost control, accuracy and utilization of electronic data interchange (EDI), including a paperless payment system, are the desireables and benefits of such a contract.</p>

<DESC><strong>The response date has been extended<br /></strong><br />The Joint Range Technical Services (J-Tech) Program is in the process of developing the acquisition strategy for the J-Tech follow-on contract, J-Tech II. Technical requirements for the J-Tech II procurement are similar to work described in the J-Tech General Technical Requirements Document (TRD), contract number: F42650-01-C-7218. Services are to be performed at the currently participating locations: 412 Test Wing, formerly Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB, CA; Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) Nellis AFB, NV; Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR), Hill AFB, UT; and Echo Range Complex (ECR), China Lake, CA. In addition to these legacy ranges, the J-Tech Program is considering the possibility of including similar workload performed at other ranges associated with the legacy ranges, the AFTC enterprise, as well as other Geographically Separated Units - locations TBD. The current J-Tech Cost-Plus-Award-Fee contract was awarded under a full and open competition; however, the J-Tech Program is assessing all strategy options and contract types for J-Tech II. The J-Tech Program anticipates a possible term of up to 10 years; a one-year basic term, plus annual option years - structure TBD. If multiple contracts are awarded, various durations are possible. Contract award is targeted for summer 2016 with an anticipated contract start of October 2016.

<a href="mailto:lauren.a.mcdermott.civ@mail.mil">ACC - New Jersey</a>
<DESC> <br>    <br>  The U.S. Army Contracting Center (ACC-NJ-ET) on behalf of Armament Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC) of Ben t Laboratories, Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet, NY, is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources of equipment for measuring and recording time-resolved mass loss information during millisecond (0.5 ms to 10 ms) laser pulse heating. During the laser pulse heating, some materials may lose mass due to thermal degradation and ablation and a system that can measure this mass loss in real-time is desired. The capabilities described below are OBJECTIVE requirements.  It is recognized that a system having all of these capabilities may be impractical, and that some trade-offs may be necessary.   <br>    <br>  The OBJECTIVE system shall include:  <br>    <br>  1.	Time resolution:  <br>  The ability to record weight changes of a material with microsecond time resolution. If a laser pulse is 0.5 ms in length, for example, the system would need to collect data on the weight loss of the sample fast enough so that data points could be collected to provide a useful mass loss curve. It is expected that this could be accomplished with 10-50 microsecond resolution or better (objective).  <br>    <br>  2.	Mass resolution:  <br>  The system would need to be able to measure mass changes on the order of 1 microgram (objective), or resolution of 10 micrograms (threshold). The sample will be losing material as a result of being hit by a laser pulse and the effects of this need to be incorporated into the mass measurement.  <br>    <br>  3.	Max sample weight  <br>  It is desired that the system can hold a sample that weighs several grams (objective) with an area on the order of 1 cm2. The system is preferred to not contain any obstructions above the sample. This allows the laser pulse beam to have access to the sample top surface for heating. If absolutely necessary, this could be altered. Allowing the system to be tilted is also a preferred capability.  <br>    <br>  4.	Data collection:  <br>  The system must be able to collect the mass data and transfer the data to a laptop computer where data can be analyzed in mass change vs. time format.  <br>    <br>  5.	Triggering:  <br>  It is desired that the system could be triggered from the laser or function generator to start collecting data (threshold).  <br>    <br>  6.	Installation and onsite training services  <br>    <br>  7.	Minimum 1 year warranty from installation  <br>    <br>  This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI). Any information or brochures submitted will be used for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to purchase the mass loss measuring system. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract (see FAR 15.201(e)). No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort.   <br>    <br>  Responses:  <br>    <br>  Interested organizations should submit a company brochure or a tailored capability statement for these requirements that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Responses will be reviewed by Benet Laboratories personnel only and will be held in a confidential manner. Submitted documentation will not be returned. Any and all information provided shall include system specifics including the following:  <br>    <br>  a. Time resolution  <br>  b. Mass resolution and information on the maximum weight of sample that can be measured  <br>  c. Method used to measure the mass change  <br>  d. Representative mass vs. time data plots  <br>    <br>  Submission Information:  <br>    <br>  Responses to the RFI must be received no later than COB 1600 EST on May 17, 2013 via email.  Interested firms should provide their address, point-of-contact with telephone number and e-mail address.  The Point of Contact for this action is Lauren McDermott, Contract Specialist, U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey, ACC-NJ-ET, Bldg. 40 Watervliet Arsenal, NY 12189; email: lauren.a.mcdermott.civ@mail.mil  NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>The following questions were posed by a potential offeror: <br>  <br> 1.   What sort of specifications are required? <br>  <br> 2.   Are these engines Turbines or Reciprocating? <br>  <br> 3.   Are you looking for new Innovative technologies to increase efficiencies and reduce fuel and O&M cost? <br>  <br> The following are the answers to the above questions: <br>  <br> 1.   No formal engine specifications are required, although the proposed system technologies should be supported with a narrative describing how the intended solution trade space will yield a product that addresses the propulsion and power needs of future Army aviation platforms.  Please see the BAA solicitation for substantiation guidance for your proposal.  <br>  <br> 2.   Current Army aviation platforms are powered by turbine engines (predominantly manned aircraft) and reciprocating engines (predominantly unmanned aircraft). The intent of this BAA is to solicit advanced engine/power system concepts that provide the propulsion and power needs of future Army aviation platforms. Whether that can be achieved through the use of turbine, reciprocating, or other propulsion technologies is up to the offeror's unique technical capabilities. <br>  <br> 3.   As stated in the BAA, the Government is seeking a design solution to optimize power to weight ratio and specific fuel consumption, while addressing affordability and life/durability.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PLEASE SEE MODIFICATION REGARDING ISSO AND 508 COMPLIANCE IN BOLD.<br /><br />INTRODUCTION:</span></strong>
<p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>
<p><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to RuRo, Inc., 321 Ballenger Center Drive, Suite 102, Frederick, Maryland 21703 to procure LIMS 24/7 Software Platform.</p>
<p><strong>Please see attachment for&nbsp;508 Compliance Language. Any modifications to the site will be 508 compliant. ISSO SECURITY OFFICER HAS STATED ISSO SECURITY IS NOT NEEDED FOR THIS REQUIREMENT, SINCE SOFTWARE WILL NOT BE HOSTING TO NIH SERVER.<br /></strong><br /><strong>PROCUREMENT</strong>:<br /><br />1. UDP LIMS 24/7 Collaborator License, Quantity: One (1) Perpetual License;<br />2. UDP LIMS 24/7 User Seats, Quantity: Two Hundred and Fifty (250); and<br />3. UDP LIMS 24/7 Module, Quantity: One (1) Each; no shipping and handling charge.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a pilot program designed to address the needs of persons with debilitating medical conditions for which no diagnosis has been found despite an extensive workup. The goals of the UDP include finding accurate diagnoses and discovering new diseases that provide insight into human physiology and genetics. The multi-user nature of NIH's UDP Translational Laboratory, along with its dynamic process structures, engenders a deep set of requirements for any candidate data and project management system.</p>
<p><strong>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</strong>:<br />April 2013 through January 31, 2014</p>
<p><strong>JUSTIFICATION</strong></p>
<p>UDP/NHGRI has been using RuRo Inc. enterprise-grade LIMS 24/7 platform developed by Ruro, Inc. a small business located in Rockville, Maryland since 2012. Ruro assisted NHGRI in establishing Phase 1 and it would be disruptive to allow another source to continue providing these services, as well compatibility issues and administrative time in gaining security access that has already been established by RuRo. The LIMS 24/7 web-based system encompasses project, task and asset management; user role configurability; user-tailored reporting; extensive audit functionality and information security. LIMS 24/7 is designed to be the meeting place of laboratory software tools, laboratory hardware, and staff users, allowing previously impossible levels of secure data access, communication and process efficiency. Additional functionality of a phenotyping engine to the LIMS 24/7 platform will allow for further valuable patient information to be captured and distributed amongst the clinical and scientific staff for developing appropriate research strategies. Ruro, Inc. will provide the Undiagnosed Diseases Program with Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS 24/7), a software platform designed for the simplification and greater efficiency of laboratory sample, data and process management. With this system, Ruro, Inc. will create a method of combining all bioinformatic processes that are used in the Undiagnosed Diseases Program for laboratory and clinical personnel to work collaboratively and efficiently. The Phenotyping management engine that is an additional part of the LIMs 24/7 project will allow the Undiagnosed Diseases Program to have phenotyping functionality within the parameters of the LIMS.</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</strong></p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541511, Custom Computer Programing Services and the Small Business Size Standard is $25.5M. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). The resultant Contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-66 (April 1, 2013). This requirement is under the SAT of $150,000.00.</p>
<p>The determination by the Government to award a purchase order on a sole source on competitive basis for LIMS 24/7 License to RuRo Inc., is a continuation of a previous order [HHSN268201200156P, issued June 1, 2012] issued for Phase 1 of this requirement. Any information received as a result of this pre-solicitation / notice of intent will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct any future competitive procurements. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>

<DESC>UPDATED to extend closing date to 30 APRIL 2013 <br>  <br>  <br> Solicitation Number: TADSS Squad Overmatch  ermatch                       <br>  Notice Type: Sources Sought   <br>    <br>  Synopsis:   <br>    <br>    <br>  1. Introduction:   <br>  The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training & Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is conducting market research to improve squad training by leveraging existing training aids, devices, simulators and simulations (TADSS).  Part of the market research is to publish a Sources Sought Notice seeking market information on businesses able to provide the capabilities, as described in the below sections.  Where relevant, responses may include TADSS used to train other units in their collective tasks.    <br>    <br>     <br>    <br>  This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Your response to this notice is strictly voluntary and will be treated as information only.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this notice or the Government use of such information. This Sources Sought Notice is not tied to any current nor anticipated to be a precursor to any future request for proposals (RFP).  <br>    <br>     <br>    <br>  The NAICS Codes and Product and Service Codes (PSC) listed in Paragraph 5,  quote mark Additional Information, quote mark  may also be applicable to this Sources Sought Notice.  <br>    <br>     <br>    <br>  2. Background:   <br>    <br>  The 2012 Army Strategic Planning Guidance (ASPG) establishes four imperatives, the first of which is to  quote mark Provide modernized and ready, tailored land force capabilities to meet Combatant Commanders' requirements across the range of military operations. quote mark  One key action in support of this imperative is to Train for Operational Adaptability, - emphasizing  quote mark both the Human Dimension and land dominance requirements of the operational environment quote mark . Another action is to Increase the Combat Power of Army Formations to achieve overmatch from the squad to the brigade and  quote mark ensure that our squads are never again in a fair fight. quote mark   <br>    <br>     <br>    <br>  This ASPG imperative underpins the Maneuver Center of Excellence's (MCoE) concept of the  quote mark Squad: Foundation of the Decisive Force quote mark  that promotes Squad Overmatch. The MCoE has focused on the need for enhancing training in the cognitive, physical, social-cultural, resilience and moral-ethical components of the Human Dimension.  <br>    <br>    <br>  Today's squads have achieved proficiency in the Human Dimension through ten years of conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the future, as Soldiers remain at home station more and Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) becomes regionally aligned, proficiency will necessarily be gained using TADSS. The US Army is seeking to improve the capabilities of TADSS, for training a squad as a collective unit, by improving realism and providing a near real-life operational environment, through injection and control of mental/cognitive and emotional stressors.  Enhancing the live fire Shoot Houses, to provide for more realistic and dynamic training in order to develop psychological resilience, is but one of many technologies that could be leveraged.  <br>    <br>     <br>    <br>  Numerous studies have indicated that a Soldier's resilience and human performance may be enhanced by training under more extreme conditions (e.g., injecting stressors such as battle sounds and smells), exposing them to more complex tasks (such as having to concurrently manage treatment of casualties, communicate with locals, and provide security) after adequate physical and psychological preparation.  The research emphasizes that training under extreme conditions alone does not harden the soldier to the stressor and does not necessarily improve resilience and performance.  Soldiers must be provided information about the stressors they will experience, and trained in techniques and methods for managing them.   <br>    <br>     <br>    <br>  A comprehensive physical and psychological program for training the Soldier - to recognize situations that cause psychological stress, to have the Soldier apply learned techniques to manage the stress, and to provide an environment where situations that cause stress can be regulated, replayed, reviewed - appears to be the optimal approach to strengthening a Soldier's resilience and improving his performance, and thereby discouraging post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicide.  <br>    <br>     <br>    <br>  The US Army Ready and Resilience Campaign defines resilience as  quote mark when faced with stress and/or adversity, [resilience] is a key factor in the mental, emotional, and behavioral ability to cope with and recover from the experience, achieve positive outcomes, adapt to change, stay healthy and grow from the experience quote mark  - enhanced performance is defined as  quote mark mental, emotional, and physical skills and health that generate optimal human performance. quote mark   <br>    <br>     <br>    <br>  3. Submission Content:  <br>  The response to this notice should include, but is not limited to, answering the following questions:  <br>    <br>             What technologies can be used alone, or added to current TADSS used for squad level training, that would improve the realism of the training environment to better approach the realities of war?  Address specific capabilities that are critical to inducing realistic stress on squads, during training, in order to enhance resilience and human performance.  Example capabilities include, but are not limited to, the following:  <br>    <br>  o    Combat environment (e.g., interactive targetry)  <br>    <br>  o    Social (e.g., interaction with locals, awareness of the squad as a team)  <br>    <br>  o    Psychological (sudden, critical unexpected situations such as losing a fellow Soldier or improvised explosive devices (IED))  <br>    <br>  o    Extreme sensory stimuli (e.g., visual: building ruins, car fires ; sound: explosions, cries of wounded ; smell: rotting garbage, burning flesh ; touch: handling human remains, heat, effects of added gear)   <br>    <br>             What emerging technologies may be leveraged in the context of the above (first) question?  Address the technical readiness and path forward for these emerging technologies.  <br>    <br>             How do we evaluate and measure TADSS and emerging technology effectiveness at closing the squad level-to-objective capability gap?    <br>    <br>             How can existing TADSS be integrated, augmented and extended with each other, and with emerging technologies, to provide optimal squad training?  <br>    <br>  o    What combinations of existing TADSS and emerging technologies promise the best return on investment based upon technology maturity, ease of integration, and resultant capability?  <br>    <br>             Can your approach/solution be applied to the Operational Environment that includes all Combatant Commands (COCOM)?  <br>    <br>             What lessons learned and capabilities, gained in recent operations, have proved successful in reducing combat stress, and can be applied to training?  <br>    <br>             Are your approach/recommendations flexible enough to support Army squad leaders as they adapt to an ever-evolving operational environment and threat?  <br>    <br>             Describe the science behind  quote mark how your approach would enhance Soldier/squad performance? quote mark   <br>    <br>             Describe how your technology could be used to  quote mark incrementally quote mark  increase levels of stress.  <br>    <br>     <br>    <br>    <br>  4.

<a href="mailto:isaac.j.taylor@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Nashville</a>
<DESC>PURPOSE: The Nashville District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation for Bear Creek Road (BCR) Phase II Construction and Potable Waterline Relocation, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This is a Presolicitation Notice. This Notice is being issued for planning and informational purposes only. This notice is not a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice, nor will the Government accept proposals as a result of this Notice. The plans and technical specifications for this requirement will only be available upon solicitation issuance. <br><br>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The relocation of BCR will tie in to the recently completed roadway on the east in the vicinity of the west end of the Polaris Parking Lot and, on the west, will tie-in to the existing Bear Creek Road just before the intersection with Old Bear Creek Road. The relocated BCR will be an urban-collector type road, compliant with Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) standards. The road will have 12-foot lanes (one in each direction) with a 10-foot-wide utility shoulder on the south side and an 18-foot-wide utility shoulder on the north.<br><br>A precast concrete beam bridge will be erected so BCR will pass over the haul road to prevent traffic into the Y-12 Complex from being interrupted or delayed by trucks on the haul road. The overpass will provide minimum vertical clearance of 20 feet, and the lower road will have a minimum width clearance of 45 feet for the full length. <br><br>The BCR relocation scope consists of:<br>Roadway construction, including overpass<br>Tie-in to BCR eastern section<br>Tie-in on the west just before the intersection of existing BCR and Old Bear Creek Road<br>Steel casing for future duct bank crossing<br>Drainage structures (including 3 retention ponds and storm drains)<br>Safety appurtenances (i.e., guardrails, etc.)<br>Signs and pavement marking<br>Spur under the overpass with a base course of asphalt and temporary lane markings and signs<br>Signalization, as determined by a study<br><br>Construction of 4,000 feet of a City of Oak Ridge 24-in diameter waterline and ~3,600 feet of a plant 16-in diameter waterline, are part of the road construction. The new reinstalled potable water lines will parallel the relocated Bear Creek Road. The 24-in line will be installed in the 18-foot utility shoulder on the north side of the road, while the 16-in line, which will reduce to 12 inches, will be installed in the 10-foot shoulder on the south side. Installation will include new valve vaults in addition to use of existing valve vaults. Installation also includes electrical service for motor-operated valves and flow event date messaging; duct banks will be installed for lines and cables, and an existing control panel will be relocated and a new control panel installed. Although these waterlines and associated power will be installed in this WBS element, tie-ins to the City of Oak Ridge and Y-12 potable water systems, as well as electrical tie-ins will occur in a following phase of work.<br><br>This description is not intended to be all encompassing and is subject to change. <br><br>NAICS CODE AND SBA SIZE STANDARD: The NAICS code for this project is 237310 with a size standard of $33,500,000. <br><br>PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS:  Offerors will be invited to submit a proposal subject to Project Labor Agreement (PLA) requirements (a PLA proposal), a proposal not subject to PLA requirements, or both. If a PLA proposal is accepted by USACE, the awardee shall be required to execute a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) with one or more appropriate labor organizations for the term of the resulting Contract.<br><br>TYPE OF SET-ASIDE: The solicitation will be unrestricted to obtain full and open competition. <br><br>SOLICITATION AND CONTRACT TYPE: It is anticipated that from the Request for Proposal Solicitation, the Government will use Best Value Trade-off Source Selection Procedures to award one Firm-Fixed Price Construction Contract. <br><br>DISCLOSURE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT: The disclosure of magnitude range is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.<br><br>SOLICITATION RELEASE DATE: The anticipated release date for this solicitation is on or before 1 June 2012.  The plans and technical specifications will be available at the time of solicitation release. <br><br>CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR): Offerors must be successfully registered in the CCR, www.ccr.gov, in order to receive a Government contract award.<br><br>ON-LINE REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS APPLICATION (ORCA): ORCA is an e-Government initiative that replaced the paper based Representations and Certifications (Reps and Certs) process. Offers must have their Reps and Certs available on-line in ORCA, https://orca.bpn.gov, prior to receiving a Government contract award.<br><br>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Specific information pertaining to this procurement will be available in the solicitation. The solicitation documents will be posted on the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) database. You can access these files from the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, www.fbo.gov. It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of all potential offerors to monitor the FBO website for any amendments, updates, responses to questions and answers, etc. as the Government will not be maintaining a mailing list. <br><br>The project location has special security requirements that will be identified in the solicitation. These special security requirements may be more stringent than what is normally required for work on Federal projects. <br><br>POINT-OF-CONTACT FOR QUESTIONS: The Contract Specialist for this solicitation is Isaac Taylor, telephone: 615-736-5679, fax: 615-749-6025, email: Isaac.J.Taylor@usace.army.mil. Any communications regarding this procurement must be made in writing and forwarded via email or facsimile and must identify the Solicitation number, company name, address, email address, phone number including area code, facsimile number, and point of contact.<br>

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice that a solicitation is scheduled to be released via FebBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) in the near future detailing requirements for a supply IDIQ requirement entitled:  quote mark Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) Tags quote mark .     <br>   SYNOPSIS:  The US Army Corps of Engineers plans to purchase passive integrated transponder (PIT) (134 - 136 kHz) tags for the next three years for research purposes associated with the Northwestern Division's Anadromous Fish Evaluation Program (AFEP).  A PIT tag is classified as a sonar reading tag under the Standard Industrial Code #3812 and is subject to radio frequency licensing.  The PIT tags needed are glass-encapsulated electronic device measuring approximately 12-12.5 mm long by 2.0- 2.1 mm in diameter for the large smolts and 8.5-9.0 mm long by 2.0-2.1 mm in diameter for the small smolts.  The tag can be coded with one of 35 billion unique codes.  As the tagged fish out-migration occurs, it passes though electronic interrogation coils established at seven permanent juvenile detection sites located at federal dams in the Columbia River Basin and other rivers, streams, adult ladders, etc.   <br>   Each PIT tag must provide the necessary readability, reliability, high performance standard, and uniquely coded passive integrated transponder tag designed for all detection devices on the Columbia River Basin.  Each tag must satisfy the Corps's requirements (without requiring major purchases of new receiver equipment (134-136 kHz range), new design of the Corner Collector technology, or compromised reliability).  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has a series of tests to evaluate how well new tag models would perform in the current network of interrogation systems. The type of test performed on the PIT tags are physical and electrical parameters (measurements, weight, resonant frequency, turn-on voltage), read ranges under different noise levels, maximum read speed under different noise levels, and impact of tag grouping on reading efficiencies (how close different groups of tags could be to each other without interfering with the transceiver's ability to detect the individual tags). Performance test are held in a controlled laboratory environment as well as under field conditions.  PIT tags must have been tested by Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission and approved by the PIT Tag Steering Committee which consists of members of various regional fisheries organizations.   <br>   PIT tags cannot interfere with other manufacturer products that are already in use.  There can be no measureable effect on other manufacturer's products already used in the Columbia River Basin.   <br>   The supplier must be able to produce and provide large quantities of PIT tags in a short time frame in order to meet delivery dates driven by the timing of out-migrating juvenile salmonids and research activities.   <br>   Other Information: The solicitation will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities web site (www.fbo.gov) when released. Solicitation is scheduled to be issued as an IDIQ contract. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only.    <br>   Conducting Business with the Government: In order for contractors to conduct business with the Department of Defense, the contractor must provide registration information to the System for Award Management (SAM). All Offerors must be SAM registered prior to receiving an award. Registration instructions may be obtained, and online registration may be accomplished, at www.sam.gov. By submission of a quote, a vendor acknowledges the requirement to be registered in the SAM database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from the solicitation.  No CD's or hard copies will be available.  The Government is not responsible for any loss of interest, connectivity, or for an offeror's inability to access the document posted at the referenced website.    <br>      <br>   Please indicate your interest by submitting a detailed statement of your firm's capabilities to supply the required items in a timely manner.   <br>      <br>

<AWARDEE>Energy Research Company, 1250 South Avenue, Plainfield, NJ 07062 US
<DESC><p>This contract was awarded without using full and open competition, to the incumbent, Energy Research Company (ERCo), 2571 Arthur Kill Rd, Suite A, Staten Island, NY 10309-1232, with an ordering period of one year for laser induced acoustic sensor for standoff detection of explosives. The Contractor shall develop and test two prototype systems using orthogonal laser-based explosive sensing technology to detect explosive residue on the exteriors of suspected IED's, Vehicle Born IED's (VBIEDs), and other structures. Both sensors will utilize Laser Induced Acoustics (LIA) technology. This contract contains cost-type line items (CLINs) for Research and Development type efforts of a nature that involves uncertainties in contract performance and does not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use a fixed-price order. This contract was awarded under a sole source procurement. The Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition will be posted separately under FedBizOpps. The statutory authority for this non-competitive action is: 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source. Market research was conducted and did not reflect any other than the incumbent capable of performing the required support that possesses the subject matter expertise and technology necessary to adequately fulfill requirements.</p>

<DESC>The Nashville District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers awarded a construction contract for the Phase II Construction and Potable Waterline Relocation of Bear Creek Road (BCR) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This is the notice of award. <br> PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The relocation of BCR will tie in to the recently completed roadway on the east in the vicinity of the west end of the Polaris Parking Lot and, on the west, will tie-in to the existing Bear Creek Road just before the intersection with Old Bear Creek Road. The relocated BCR will be an urban-collector type road, compliant with Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) standards. The road will have 12-foot lanes (one in each direction) with a 10-foot-wide utility shoulder on the south side and an 18-foot-wide utility shoulder on the north. <br>  <br> A precast concrete beam bridge will be erected so BCR will pass over the haul road to prevent traffic into the Y-12 Complex from being interrupted or delayed by trucks on the haul road. The overpass will provide minimum vertical clearance of 20 feet, and the lower road will have a minimum width clearance of 45 feet for the full length. <br>  <br> The BCR relocation scope consists of: <br> Roadway construction, including overpass <br> Tie-in to BCR eastern section <br> Tie-in on the west just before the intersection of existing BCR and Old Bear Creek Road <br> Steel casing for future duct bank crossing <br> Drainage structures (including 3 retention ponds and storm drains) <br> Safety appurtenances (i.e., guardrails, etc.) <br> Signs and pavement marking <br> Spur under the overpass with a base course of asphalt and temporary lane markings and signs <br> Signalization, as determined by a study <br>  <br> Construction of 4,000 feet of a City of Oak Ridge 24-in diameter waterline and ~3,600 feet of a plant 16-in diameter waterline, are part of the road construction. The new reinstalled potable water lines will parallel the relocated Bear Creek Road. The 24-in line will be installed in the 18-foot utility shoulder on the north side of the road, while the 16-in line, which will reduce to 12 inches, will be installed in the 10-foot shoulder on the south side. Installation will include new valve vaults in addition to use of existing valve vaults. Installation also includes electrical service for motor-operated valves and flow event date messaging; duct banks will be installed for lines and cables, and an existing control panel will be relocated and a new control panel installed. Although these waterlines and associated power will be installed in this WBS element, tie-ins to the City of Oak Ridge and Y-12 potable water systems, as well as electrical tie-ins will occur in a following phase of work.
