<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-05 and DFARs Change Notice (DCN) 20050901.  Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code is 3679, FSC Code is 5999 and the size standard is 500 employees.  NAICS is 334419.
This acquisition is for Brand Name items only and is a small business set-aside.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures (The award will be less than $100,000) will be followed.  This Brand Name purchase will be for the following: B basic 3.5 interface chassis, 2LEDs per channel, switches on every other channel, modular power supply included (9-each). One TTL BNC in/ (3) TTL BNC out (69-each).  Four TTL BNC TTL BNC out (39-each).    
Brand Name Justification Information:
1.  The 412 TW/DRP has a requirement for a Brand Name purchase of Apogee Labs equipment required to upgrade the existing telemetry distribution equipment.   
2.  The required telemetry equipment upgrade from Apogee Labs is needed for multiple telemetry outputs.  This telemetry distribution equipment is for the new control room under construction at Ridley Mission Control Center, Edwards Air Force Base, CA. The interface chassis and distribution modules (cards) must support a data rate of 50 mega-hertz to ensure equal distribution in the control room. This effort is to support the 412TH Test Wing mission.  Market research conducted by the Program Office has shown that non Apogee Labs equipment would not be compatible with the existing equipment.  Replacing all the current equipment would be cost prohibitive and negatively impact the mission.  Differences in configuration from the existing equipment could jeopardize the development and use of capabilities at Edwards AFB in support of the 412TH Test Wing mission.  The required equipment upgrade includes:  B basic 3.5 interface chassis, 2LEDs per channel, switches on every other channel, modular power supply included (9-each). One TTL BNC in/ (3) TTL BNC out (69-each).  Four TTL BNC TTL BNC out (39-each).    
  The equipment is all commercial in nature and available to other business entities from Apogee Labs.
3.  Apogee Labs is the name brand currently utilized in this area of the 412TH Test Wing.  The equipment is proprietary to Apogee Labs.  As a result, no other vendor’s products will meet the requirement for interfacing with the existing proprietary equipment.  Due to form, fit and function requirements, the required upgrades must be procured by Apogee Labs.
 
Interested parties who believe they can meet all the requirements for the required Apogee Labs upgrades described in this synopsis are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the required training requirement.  Offerors are required to submit with their quote enough information for the Government to evaluate the minimum requirements detailed in this synopsis.  CONTRACTORS MUST COMPLY WITH FAR 52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003) AND DFARS 252.204-7004, ALTERNATE A (NOV 2003).  INTERESTED CONTRACTORS CAN ACCESS THE CLAUSE BY INTERNET URL: http://farsite.hill.af.mil.  TO REGISTER WITH THE CCR, GO TO URL: https://www.ccr.dlsc.dla.mil/.

The following provisions and clauses apply: Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial; clause 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items, the following factor shall be used to evaluate offers: technically acceptable to the Government lowest price offer; clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items; clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders--Commercial Items (to include: 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Special Disabled and Vietnam Era Veterans; 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Handicapped Workers; 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era); clause 52.232-33 Mandatory information for electronic funds transfer payment.

<DESC>Air Force Space Command has started the preliminary planning process (P3) required by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 and the 1 Jan 05 USAF Commercial Activities A-76 Preliminary Planning Guidebook for space control operations, Air Force Space Surveillance Sensor (AFSSS) data computation, and mission systems support at 20th Space Control Squadron, Detachment 1 (20 SPCS, Det 1), Dahlgren VA.  As part of P3, the team conducts preliminary market research to determine the existence of viable commercial source(s) capable of providing the necessary services and to determine the appropriate groupings of activities as business units.  (Extensive market research necessary to support acquisition strategy decisions will be conducted if/after a streamlined or standard competition is announced in accordance with OMB Circular A-76.)  

The scope of the required services is threefold:  space control operations, AFSSS data computation, and mission systems support for 20 SPCS, Det 1 within Government facilities at Dahlgren, VA.  First, space control operations services support the 20 SPCS, Det 1 mission as the Alternate Space Control Center (ASCC)—the alternate processing center, command, control, and communications interface for the Joint Space Control Center located in Cheyenne Mountain Air Station.  Space control operations include detecting, tracking, identifying, cataloging, and maintaining accurate identification of all man-made objects in space; providing collision avoidance for the International Space Station and space shuttle; and providing space-related operational intelligence using government-furnished mission systems and all in accordance with STRATCOM Directive (SD) 505-1, Volumes I and II.  The assets in the space surveillance network (SSN) are the source for all of the raw data facilitating space control operations.  Specialized knowledge and developed analytical skills are necessary to perform space control operations to include an understanding of the SSN; an understanding of orbital mechanics; an understanding of the functionality and by-products of optical sensors, phased-array radars, and space-based radars; and an understanding of launch vehicles, payloads, and launch facilities.  Second, services include data computation for the six AFSSS receiver sites.  Both the space control operations and AFSSS data computation services involve processing, manipulating, interpreting, and analyzing all space events (domestic and foreign) such as launches, maneuvers, deorbits, separations, conjunction analysis, reentry assessments, break-ups, and decays.  Specialized knowledge and developed analytical skills are necessary to perform AFSSS data computation to include an understanding of orbital mechanics; an understanding of the fixed-radar functionality; and an understanding of launch vehicles, payloads, and launch facilities.  Third, mission systems support includes operating, administering, monitoring, and maintaining (organizational/user-lever maintenance only) the Mission Processing System (MPS) at Dahlgren, VA.  The MPS consists of multiple networked processors and associated mission system equipment using a UNIX-based operating system.  The network consists of CISCO routers and hubs.  The system is designed with redundant processing capability and back-up systems to ensure operational availability.  The core of the MPS is two multi-node IBM towers that perform the majority of the computational processing.  Other key MPS components include a high-availability cluster of three IBM servers that provide database and file systems services.  There are also approximately 90 workstations for application processing by the operational users.  The MPS software consists of over two hundred applications including communications and data processing applications that operate continually for real-time processing.  The service includes monitoring the real-time execution of these applications.

All services are required twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  Service provider employees must be U.S. citizens with either a secret or top-secret/sensitive-compartmented information security clearance.  

This sources sought synopsis is published under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541513 with an associated Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of $21 million.  The 541513 NAICS code best describes the mission system support and a portion of the space control operations and AFSSS data computation.  Another sources sought synopsis is also published under the NAICS code 541690 with an associated size standard of $6 million.  The 541690 NAICS code best describes a good portion of the space control operations and AFSSS data computation services.  If as a result of the P3 report a standard competition is announced and the services are solicited as a whole, a single NAICS code will be selected that best describes the overall acquisition based on value.  

Request companies that are interested in performing the services described above provide an electronic capabilities package to the contracting officer not later than 23 Sep 05.  In addition to describing capability to provide the service, ensure the package addresses the following:  (1) Provide a summary and customer points of contact on past contracts for similar services.  (2) Discuss the appropriate groupings of business activities.  For example, is it logical to group the space control operations, AFSSS data computation, and mission system support together in one effort/contract or should they be split as separate requirements and why?  (3)  Which, if any, parts of the effort would you likely subcontract rather than using in-house resources and why?  (4) Discuss your ability and sources to obtain and retain qualified personnel.  (5) Address recommendations regarding selection of NAICS code.  (6) Address business size status (to include specific identification as an 8a, HUBZone, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business) based on proposed and your recommended NAICS codes.  (7) Provide a point of contact for follow-up questions.
