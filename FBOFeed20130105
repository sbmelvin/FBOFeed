<p>FAR 52-212-1 Instructions to Offerors is incorporated by reference.</p>
<p>FAR 52-212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Addendum</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS</p>
<p>I. PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>A. To assure timely and equitable evaluation of proposals, offerors must follow the instructions contained herein. Offerors are required to meet all requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications and Performance Work Statement requirements. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The response shall consist of three (3) separate parts; Volume I - Price Proposal, Volume II - Past Performance Information, and Volume III - Past Performance References. You must submit an original and one (1) paper copy. Offerors are cautioned to follow the detailed instructions fully and carefully, as the Government intends to make an award based on the initial offers received, without discussion of such offers.</p>
<p>In proposal volumes, follow the quantity and page limits as follows:</p>
<p>Section, Copies and Page Limits</p>
<p>Volume I - Price Proposal (Bid Schedule) Original + (1) copy No page limit<br /><br />Volume II - Past Performance Proposal Original + (1) copy 10 pages (*)</p>
<p>Volume III - Past Performance References Original + (1) copy No page limit (**)<br />(Appendix A) <br /><br />Completed Past Performance Original + (1) copy No page limit (**)<br />Questionnaires (Appendix B)</p>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>* If the offeror is utilizing significant subcontractors, a total of ten (10) additional pages are authorized for all subcontractors past performance information.</p>
<p>** Provide the form at Appendix A of not more than five (5) references of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last three (3) years as part of the Past Performance Volume III. If the offeror is utilizing significant subcontractors, in addition to the five (5) references for the prime, the offeror may provide five (5) additional references for each significant subcontractor. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will NOT be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.</p>
<p>The paper files will be checked to determine the number of pages and compliance with proposal instructions. Those pages in excess of the limit will be removed from the back of the Volume II and returned by the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) to ensure they are not evaluated. The Government will not keep any pages in excess of the limit. If Evaluation Notices (EN's) are required, page limits may be placed on any responses. Any page limits for responses to ENs will be identified in the letter forwarding the ENs to you. Excess pages submitted in response to EN's will also be removed in the same manner by the PCO.</p>
<p>B. The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists; offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine the reasonableness and affordability of the price. In accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) and 15.403-3(a), data other than cost or pricing data may be required to support price reasonableness and realism. Data shall be provided in accordance with FAR 15.403-5. If, after receipt of proposals, the CO determines that there is insufficient information available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in FAR 15.403-1 apply, the Offeror shall be required to submit certified cost or pricing data. Should adequate price competition not exist after receipt of proposals, the provisions of FAR Part 15.403-4 shall apply, and the Offeror will be asked to provide certification of cost or pricing data?</p>
<p>C. Specific Instructions:</p>
<p>1. Volume I - PRICE PROPOSAL - Submit Original Proposal and One (1) Copy</p>
<p>(a) Insert proposed price on the bid schedule (Attachment 2) for base year and four (4) option years. A breakout of the estimated workload data for Oil/Water Separators, Grease Traps and Lift Stations can be found in Appendix A of the attached Performance Work Statement (Attachment 1).</p>
<p>(b) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm until 1 April 2013.</p>
<p>2. Volume II -PAST PERFORMANCE PROPOSAL - Submit Original Proposal and One (1) Copy</p>
<p>Only information for same or similar type contracts is desired. Provide any information currently available (i.e. descriptive language, letters, metrics, customer surveys, independent surveys, etc.) which demonstrates customer satisfaction with overall job performance and quality of completed projects for same or similar type contracts completed in the last three years. In addition, explain corrective actions taken in the past, if any, for substandard performance and any current performance problems such as extended performance periods, numerous warranty calls, etc. Provide comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions. If applicable, provide a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement, consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime contractor. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have recent and relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will NOT be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.</p>
<p>3. Volume III -PAST PERFORMANCE REFERENCES - Submit Original Proposal and One (1) Copy.</p>
<p>(a) Only references for same or similar type contracts are desired.</p>
<p>(b) The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's performance deemed recent and relevant to the requirements of this RFP. The Government will use information submitted on the Appendix A and Appendix B forms, the Past Performance Proposal and other sources such as other Federal Government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance. Recent and relevant contracts include contracts that meet the recent and relevancy definition cited below. The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have recent and relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition; however, past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have recent and relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will NOT be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.</p>
<p>RECENT AND RELEVANT INFORMATION For the purpose of this solicitation, Recent and Relevant Past Performance is defined as:</p>
<p>1. RECENT - Ongoing contracts with a performance history, and contracts completed within three (3) years from the issue date of this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation posting.</p>

<p>52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items - Addendum</p>
<p>EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS</p>
<p>I. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD</p>
<p>A. This is a competitive Best Value acquisition using the Tradeoff Process, without technical proposals, with Past Performance being approximately equal to Price. This procurement will be conducted as a Total Small Business Set-Aside for small business concerns eligible under the small business program. The Government will award a contract resulting from the solicitation to the acceptable, responsible Small Business offeror whose proposal conforming to this solicitation offers the Best Value to the Government, with Past Performance being approximately equal to Price. Evaluation criteria are the same for all competing offerors.</p>
<p>B. Offerors shall propose on all items. Any offer that fails to cite a price for each item or fails to make an entry that indicates service will be provided at no charge may be rejected as nonconforming to this solicitation.</p>
<p>C. Only Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) offers will be evaluated. An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.</p>
<p>D. The evaluation process will proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1. Price: Initially, offers will be ranked according to Total Evaluated Price (TEP). The price evaluation will be made on the basis of the total price of all line items including the corresponding CLINs under Options. An offeror must therefore propose on all line items including the options. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness based on prices submitted from competitive proposals, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate. Prices will also be evaluated to determine if they are materially unbalanced. Materially unbalanced prices risk rejection.</p>
<p>2. Past Performance: Using the information provided in the Past Performance Reference Information (Appendix A), completed Past Performance Questionnaires (Appendix B) and other available information, the contracting officer shall seek recent and relevant performance information on all offerors based on the past efforts provided by the offeror and data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources.<br /><br />(a) Recent and Relevant Information: For the purpose of this combined synopsis/solicitation, Recent and Relevant Past Performance is defined as:</p>
<p>(1) Recent - Ongoing contracts with a performance history and contracts completed within three (3) years from the issue date of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) Relevant - Performance of work efforts involving Oil/Water, Grease Traps and Lift Stations services and management that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation and performance work statement.</p>
<p>(b) The Government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this RFP, based on the offeror's demonstrated past performance. The Government will conduct a performance confidence assessment based upon past performance of the offerors as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the solicitation requirements. This evaluation will include the contractor's record of: (A) conforming to the Performance Work Statement and contract requirements, (B) management of work, (C) reasonable, cooperative behavior, performance and commitment to customer satisfaction and (D) quality control. This assessment represents the government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort, based upon the offeror's demonstrated past performance. The rating may be determined initially or as a result of discussions. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence.</p>
<p>(c) Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Definitions for Performance Confidence Assessments and Relevancy are as defined below:</p>
<p>Performance Confidence Assessments</p>
<p>Substantial Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, The Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Limited Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, The Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>No Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, The Government has no expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Unknown Confidence (Neutral) - No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>Past Performance Relevancy Ratings Definitions</p>
<p>Very Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br /><br />Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>(d) In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFP.</p>
<p>E. Best Value Determination: Offerors will be initially ranked from lowest Total Evaluated Price (TEP) to the highest TEP.</p>
<p>1. If the lowest TEP is determined to be reasonable, and is judged to have an overall Substantial confidence performance rating, that offer represents the Best Value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>2. IF THE LOWEST TEP OFFER IS NOT JUDGED TO HAVE AN OVERALL SUBSTAINIAL CONFIDENCE PEFORMANCE RATING THE EVALUATION WILL CONTINUE AS FOLLOWS:</p>
<p>(a) If the lowest TEP acceptable offer is reasonable, but does not have a confidence rating of Substantial Confidence, the next lowest TEP, acceptable offer will be evaluated and the process will continue until an offeror whose price is reasonable receives a confidence rating of Substantial Confidence overall for past performance.</p>
<p>(b) The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment Best Value award decision by determining if the Best Value to the Government is to pay a higher cost for a higher past performance assessment rating. The Government reserves the following rights:</p>
<p>(1) To award a contract to the lowest TEP offeror who has Substantial Confidence Rating;<br />(2) To award to higher TEP offeror who has Substantial Confidence Rating;<br />(3) To award a contract to the lowest TEP offeror who has at least a Satisfactory Confidence Rating.</p>
<p>3. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in FAR 52.212-1. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of present and past performance information) or respond to adverse present/past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>4. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>
<p>5. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers: The Government may reject any proposal that is assessed to be unrealistic in terms of contract requirements, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect lack of competence or failure to comprehend the scope of the requirement. Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of price may be rejected at any time during the evaluation process. Proposals are intended to be evaluated, and award made, without discussions with the offerors (other than minor clarification[s]), unless discussions are determined to be necessary. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. Offerors may be required to participate in telephone discussions or in face-to-face oral discussions at the Operational Contracting Division, 308 West "D" Avenue, Suite 130, Bldg 260, Eglin AFB FL. Offerors are cautioned to follow the detailed instructions fully and carefully, as the Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial offers received, without discussion of such offers. The offeror's initial proposal should reflect their best effort.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS <br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>
<p>All forms are available for download on the MSC contracts webpage at http://www.msc.navy.mil. Click on "Contracts" in the upper right corner. "EPIC template" is under "Reference" subheading. Click on "Online Library of Common Documents" for all other forms.</p>
<p>EPIC: Required for access to MSC vessels. Complete EPIC form strictly adhering to format requirements and forward to (CONUS East Coast repairs) MSFSC(underscore)EPIC(underscore)EAST@navy.mil and (CONUS West Coast and HI repairs) MSC.SSUSD.EPIC@NAVY.MIL. EPIC personnel screening requests are desired seven calendar days prior to performance start date. Requests will be managed as expeditiously as circumstances permit. Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>
