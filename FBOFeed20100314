Additional parenteral products may be added from time to time as mutually agreed.  Because VACT is a teaching hospital and its residents rotate between the Yale and St. Raphael Medical Centers, it is expected that the IV formulations be the same for the purposes of maintaining familiarity and minimizing the risk of prescribing errors by the residents.  The "IV Services" vendor will guarantee a monthly service level of 100% of all orders received prior to the cut off time as mutually agreed to in writing.  The "IV Services" Vendor will strive to fulfill all change orders received after the cut off time but prior to physical shipment.VACT Healthcare System will send via facsimile, personal computer and the "IV Services" vendor proprietary software, or direct computer interface the appropriate orders necessary for the "IV Services" vendor to accurately admix.  Any electronic transmission of data will be encrypted to ensure safeguarding of patient privacy.  For anticipatory compounding, orders will be placed on an official VA Connecticut Healthcare System IV order form.  Initiation of an order will be executed by authorized personnel of VACT Healthcare System and any changes in personnel authorized to execute an order will be communicated to the "IV Services" vendor in writing.  Orders received by the "IV Services" vendor for VACT Healthcare System will be limited to reasonable quantities of each drug as demonstrated by historic usage patterns.  Proof of historic usage patterns will be made available for review.  Doses provided to VACT Healthcare System from the "IV Services" vendor must contain labeling that includes compounding information as well as labeling that includes VACT Healthcare System name and sequential numbering for each dose to aid the receiving pharmacy in tracking each dose to final patient use.  VACT Healthcare System will assign each sequentially numbered dose to a specific patient and apply sufficient internal labeling prior to final delivery for patient administration to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.Each party acknowledges that certain information it will acquire from the other party is of a special and unique character and constitutes Confidential Information.  For purposes of this Agreement, Confidential Information means any business, marketing, and financial information not generally known about the business or readily ascertainable by proper means by others, including without limitation, all methods, processes, trade secrets, formularies, employee or subcontractor information, and all patient identifiable information (including without limitation, any medical or billing information).  Having acknowledged the foregoing, each party must agree: (a) to exercise the same degree of care and protection (but no less than a reasonable degree of care and protection) with respect to the other party's Confidential Information as each party exercises with respect to its own Confidential Information, and in accordance with applicable law; and (b) not to, directly or indirectly, disclose, copy, transfer or allow access to any Confidential Information of the other party.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees and to third parties performing services for such party related to the purposes of this Agreement who have need to know and who have a contractual or legal duty to protect such Confidential Information, and subject to applicable law.  All notices, invoices, requests, and other communications will be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given when presented personally or when faxed directly and confirmed by telephone or mailed by certified, return receipt mail addressed to the VACT Pharmacy Office and the vendor awarded the contract.The "IV Services" vendor must comply with all applicable standards established by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JC).  The "IV Services" vendor staff, affiliate personnel, and any others providing services will be properly trained and credentialed and properly reviewed according to the requirements set forth by JC.
