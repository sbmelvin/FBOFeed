Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. 	 Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.  The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.  
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement  make contact with the firm(s) listed.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set-aside).  Foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could if otherwise eligible participate as subcontractor(s).  
Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for Radar Sensor Processing and Exploitation <br>  <br> THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. <br>  <br> The US Army, Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD), is seeking information on the sensor resource management applications, change detection technologies, aided target detection and change detection workflow tools for Ku-band radar sensors.   <br>  <br> Sensor resource manager (SRM) applications being pursued are designed to provide a simple workflow for image collection planning by mapping a basic, user-friendly interface to the more complex sensor mode parameters (e.g. sensor update rate and coverage determined by shape drawn on a map along with a selection of the desired target type). <br>  <br> Change detection tools being pursued can create a change-detection image of two or more complex SAR images collected over the same area.  Change detection algorithms may include coherent change detection, non-coherent change detection, polarization change detection, etc. with no limitation on the collection mode (stripmap, spotlight, etc.).  Change detection tools are modular such that they can be incorporated and executed within an overarching exploitation architecture (e.g. ground station). <br>  <br> Change detection workflow tools being pursued address imagery archival, lookup, and registration for automated processing to ease the workload of analysts in finding image pairs eligible for exploitation. <br>  <br> SAR Aided Target Detection (AiTD) tools being pursued are able to promote rapid detection of targets of interest with minimal user input by processing imagery in a near-real time fashion.  Real-time operation provides users with simple, actionable alerts with associated confidence. <br>  <br> The tools and applications being pursued are developed for government purpose with sufficient modularity to operate with various radar sensors and exploitation architectures. <br>  <br> Responders are requested to provide information for any of the following topics: <br> Description of sensor resource management applications including:  <br>     User-interface <br>     Mode capabilities <br>     Current sensor implementations <br>  <br> Description of change detection algorithm / tool including: <br>     Pass-to-pass geometry limitations / tolerances  <br>     Terrain limitations / tolerances (e.g. slope, foliage, etc.) <br>     Product image format <br>     Modularity <br>     User input requirements <br>     Processing requirements <br>     Coherence measurements <br>  <br> Description of change detection workflow including: <br>     Implementation and performance on current radar sensors. <br>  <br> Description of SAR AiTD algorithm / tool including: <br>     Target detection IDs <br>     False alarm rate <br>     Execution time (e.g. near real-time) <br>     User input requirements <br>     Configurability / tuneability <br>     Ease of exploitation <br>  <br> Written inputs are requested within 10 days of this announcement. Responders are requested to submit one electronic copy to usarmy.apg.cerdec.mbx.i2wd-radar-rfi@mail.mil. There is a 10MB email limit.  If classified submission is required, request how and where to send through the e-mail address provided.  If electronic submission is not available, submit one hard copy to Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate, Radar and Combat ID Division, Bldg 6003, Aberdeen Proving Ground 21005. Responses shall not exceed 5 pages in length.  The Government does not intend to pay for this information. <br>  <br> The only individuals authorized to respond to this RFI are US citizens. <br> No Foreign Nationals can support this submission.

<DESC><br /><strong>This Notice of Intent to Establish a Qualified Supplier List is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.<br /><br />The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) program anticipate issuing a Sources Sought Notification for the establishment of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Luer Activated Needleless Connectors through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website on or about 01 April 2014. This is not a request for quote or proposal.</strong>
<p>Examples of items for the QSL could include but are not limited to: Luer Activated Needleless Connectors which are Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) free; latex-free or latex safe; Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) safe; sterile; and with zero or neutral fluid displacement features.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this effort will be to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL. The QSL for Luer Activated Needleless Connectors will be the basis of a separate Standardization Action (SA) resulting in an Incentive Agreement (IA). This initiative will be part of the MSPV program which is executed by the DLA Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in the QSL process vendors must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Medical/Surgical PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. Vendors who previously had an active record in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM). For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support's MSPV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on DAPA for the DLA Troop Support MSPV program. The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, william.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124. Detailed information about the QSL requirements will be provided in the QSL FBO Announcement. The purpose of this Notice of Intent to Establish a Qualified Supplier List is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the QSL FBO is imminent. Upon issuance of the QSL FBO, all relevant information will be available electronically on the FBO website.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) intends to solicit proposals from offerors having the capability to identify and quantify drugs and their metabolites in biological fluids and tissues such as plasma/serum, urine, sweat, saliva, hair and brain and other tissues.
<p>These drugs may include cannabinoids, opiates, amphetamines, l alpha acetyl methadol (LAAM), naltrexone, methadone, cocaine, phencyclidine, anabolic steroids, opioid peptides and peptidomimetics, benzodiazepines, and other drugs and their metabolites. The concentrations of such drugs and metabolites usually appear in biological materials at ng/g or ng/ml levels and therefore require the use of state-of-the-art chromatography methods for separation and highly sensitive instrumentations for identification and quantification, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS).</p>
<p>The successful offeror must be able to perform the tasks listed below:</p>
<p>1.	Quantify a variety of drugs of abuse and other chemical substances and/or their metabolites in biological fluids such as plasma, urine, saliva, sweat and various tissues specimens upon NIDA authorization (specimen for analysis will be provided by research investigators);</p>
<p>2.	Routinely research and modify existing methods to improve specificity and sensitivity for analyzing drugs and their metabolites (at least two per year);</p>
<p>3.	Develop and validate new assays for existing and new compounds (at least one compound per year) upon NIDA authorization; and</p>
<p>4.	Develop analytical methods that shall provide sensitivity and specificity for pharmacokinetic studies, usually in ng/ml, or ng/g range. For example, for analysis of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in urine and serum, sensitivity of 0.10 ng is required.</p>
<p>NIDA may substitute analyses of 150 samples with analytical method development for one drug or compound. Additionally, the Contractor shall provide relevant literature, data search, and information to NIDA as and when needed.</p>
<p>In order to handle substances under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, it is mandatory that the successful offeror possess a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Registration for Chemical Analysis or Research for Schedules II to V controlled substances and demonstrate the capability to obtain a DEA Chemical Analysis or Research registration for Schedule I controlled substances.</p>
<p>NIDA anticipates the award of one cost-reimbursement, level of effort-type contract for a base period of one year with four one-year options to extend performance. RFP No. N01DA-14-7788 will be available electronically on or about August 16, 2013. You will be able to access the RFP through FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov or through the NIDA website at the following URL: http://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/funding-opportunities/nida-requests-contract-proposals-rfps). All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in or accessible through the RFP package. Responses to the RFP will be due on or about 45 days after release of the RFP. NIDA will consider proposals submitted by any responsible offeror.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the Contracting Officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.</p>

<DESC><div style="text-align: justify;">The United States Government (USG), represented by the United States Agency for International Development Regional Contracting Office (RCO/Kosovo) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) on behalf of its client Mission, USAID/Kosovo.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract for a three-year, $4,500,000 to $5,500,000 activity entitled Empower - Local Credit Support Facility to be implemented in Kosovo is anticipated.  USAID anticipates making one direct award for the implementation of this activity.</div>
<p>The primary objective of the Empower - Local Credit Support Facility activity is to create a local credit facility as a non-banking financial institution to initially provide partial loan guarantees to banks that lend in targeted sectors such as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The overarching goal is increased investment and private sector employment from increased lending by banks to the private sector that accelerates business creation and expansion. This initiative is similar to the Small Business Administration in the U.S. that provides business loan guarantees. It also addresses a key constraint to economic growth, access to credit, as identified by the USAID Economic Growth Constraint Analysis.</p>
<p>The two objectives of the Empower - Local Credit Support Facility activity are:</p>
<p>1.	Sustainable local credit facility issuing local credit guarantees; and <br />2.	Increased understanding of the financial community and relevant stakeholders about financial intermediation and tools for business growth.</p>
<p>The Empower - Local Credit Support Facility activity will be implemented in partnership with the Government of Kosovo and other donors.</p>
<p>This will be a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. Except for the above, no additional information regarding this planned RFP is available at this time.  All necessary information will be supplied when the RFP is posted on www.fedbizopps.gov, o/a 7 business days of this notice.  Questions/requests for information will not be responded to until RFP issuance.</p>
<p>Prospective Offerors are advised that this procurement is subject to internal USAID approvals and availability of funds.  This solicitation notice in no way obligates USAID to release a solicitation or to award a contract.</p>

To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management database at https://www.sam.gov.

Contractors must also be registered with and maintain a Supplier Evaluation Risk Rating of Moderate or better with Dun and Bradstreet (www.dnb.com) 
NAICS Code is 623110 (Nursing Care Facilities) with a small business size standard of $25.5M. The solicitation will be issued for full and open competition. Multiple awards are anticipated.  All responsible sources may submit proposals which may be considered by the Agency. 

The VA will only consider proposals from contractors who are licensed by their respective States and who are Medicare/Medicaid qualified.

The provision at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999) applies to this requirement. The Government will award a firm fixed price Basic Order Agreement (BOA) resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer(s) conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.

Technical Proposal - Factor 1.
	The Technical Proposal shall include the entire solicitation with applicable areas completed, including information required to complete all applicable clauses and provisions.  By submitting a proposal and signing block 30a-30c of  SF 1449, offeror certifies they have the ability to perform in accordance with VHA Handbook 1143.2 and the solicitation terms and conditions 

"	Criteria within VHA Handbook 1143.2

"	A site visit may also be required.

Copy of VHA Handbook 1143.2 is available online at http://www.va.gov/vhapublications/publications.cfm?pub=2

Description
All community nursing homes under VA agreements must be certified under Title XVIII (Medicare) or Title XIX (Medicaid) and meet all state licensing requirements.  

The VA will analyze the CMS Nursing Home Compare, CMS 5-Star ratings in all spheres,  MDS QI Profile data, a copy of the most recent State Survey Agency (SSA) Form 2567 Statement of Deficiencies with Plan of Correction, and any complaints against the nursing home that are reported to the State. 

When the document examination indicates that the nursing home is in substantial compliance, an informational visit is made to the nursing home by a VA representative. This visit is designed to meet the leadership of the nursing home, to learn about the nursing home's special programs, and to determine how the nursing home can best meet veterans' needs.  
When the document examination indicates deficiencies of scope, severity, or number that prevent the nursing from meeting the threshold standards the Review Team either conducts an on-site survey, or recommends that the agreement not be initiated. 
?

Past Performance Information - Factor 2
The Offeror shall provide the following documents:
"	Copy of current licensure
"	Most recent SS-2567 (including Plan of Correction)
"	Current MDS-QI Profile (Summary Only - no patient identifying information to be included)
"	Copies of complaint investigation reports conducted by the State over the past year
"	Letters of references to include State contracts or Federal contracts (if applicable)	

Past Performance Questionnaire. (Attachment C of solicitation) For each contract reference provided, the Offeror will have its' reference submit a completed and signed questionnaire to [Contract Specialist listed in block 8 of SF 1449].  Questionnaires should be provided to the VA in a timely manner so their responses are received by the Government no later than the solicitation closing date and time for which the proposal was submitted as stated on the SF 1449.  The government may, at its sole discretion, waive the timeliness requirements for late past performance questionnaires.  The government may contact contract references to verify data, conduct interviews, and to follow-up on questionnaire submissions.

The purpose of Past Performance evaluation is to assess the degree of confidence the Government will have in an Offeror's ability to provide services that meet customer needs.  The Past Performance evaluation will assess how successfully the Offeror's performance has been for the same size and scope requirements.  The evaluation will focus on and target performance that is relevant to the principal tasks of the Statement Of Work.  A performance confidence rating will be assigned based on the offeror's ability to perform the requirements of this solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to consider information of past performance from other sources.  The Government will utilize all sources available to it, in addition to the references provided by the Offeror to evaluate and rate the past performance.


Price Proposal - Proposal shall consist of:

SF 1449.  Complete the "Signature of Offeror/Contractor" part of the Standard Form 1449 in Block 30a,
30b, and 30c.  An authorized official of the firm must sign the Standard Form 1449.  

Price Schedule.  Price information will be entered on page 7, Price Schedule
Complete each requested service of care, if not applicable indicate with N/A.

EVALUATION RATING:

Description of factor:  The Government will conduct a price review of each service based on approved Medicaid rates and current market conditions to determine fair and reasonableness.

The SAOW/VISN 18 Contracting will publish an electronically consolidated notification via a Federal Business Opportunities Award Notice once all sites Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) have been awarded; the award posting notice on the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) Website (http://www.fbo.gov/), will serve as non-awardees official electronic notification of non-award. 

Placements will be made in contract facilities based on availability of facilities and the desires of the veterans and their respective families. Because it is impossible to determine actual usage of any particular contract facility, the VA uses Basic Ordering Agreements with no guaranteed minimums.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Astrogeology Science Center (ASC)has a requirement to purchase (9) nine, 24" diameter, internal-illumination digital video globes with hardware/software necessary for projecting and displaying global digital data sets at 1024 x 768 resolution.  The internal-illumination, digital video globe is a data projection system that allows for global digital data to be presented easily and accurately on a self-contained system that does not require large facility space or calibration support.
The requested products appear to be uniquely provided by the company Global Imagination. Requirements mandate that the projection system be internal illumination only, as opposed to a system of external projectors. The mandate for internal-illumination stems from the fact that facilities in the RPIF (Regional Planetary Image Facility) Network lacks the physical space to accommodate external projectors. Globes are meant to be portable such that they can be taken to public outreach events. External projection systems are not reasonably portable. Hardware and software required for interfacing with the digital globes is proprietary and can only be obtained from vendor Global Imagination. Their support system makes it possible to project, display, animate, and manipulate global digital data sets of all planets in the Solar System, at a minimum resolution of 1024 x 768.   USGS Astrogeology Science Center develops for NASA planetary global digital data products which these products will allow for ingesting and proper presentation, for public understanding and data accessibility of dynamic global and planetary systems.
The Government intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with Global Imagination, the manufacturer of the Magic Planet Digital Globe in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b) and the procedures of FAR Part 12, entitled, Acquisition of Commercial Items.   
Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish this digital video globe for projecting and displaying digital data sets may submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer via email at ccabalsi@usgs.gov no later than the closing date of this announcement at 17:00 local time.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  As required by FAR 5.101(a)(1), the forthcoming Request for Quote (G14PS00206) will be made available through the GPE on or about March 4, 2014 whether or not competitive opportunities have been identified.  All responses must be in writing, by email, to the Contracting Officer.

NOTICE: This is not a solicitation but rather a Sources Sought Synopsis to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.<br />1.1 The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 336413 which has a corresponding Size standard of 1,000 employees. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.<br />2. Program Details:<br />Description<br />This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information amendment. The following information is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting market research of industry to identify sources that meet Air Force requirements. This is neither a request for proposal nor an invitation for bid. There will be no reimbursement for the information provided. This Sources Sought is to provide information on the MicroCID (NSN 7025-01-487-3793WF and 7025-01-606-0374WF) used for loading mission data on Data Transfer Cartridges for the F-16 and A-10 Aircraft. <br />The MicroCID plays a critical role in daily flight operations for the F-16 and A-10 fleets. The MicroCID was bought from what is now General Electric Aviation, as an off-the-shelf asset to support mission planning. The government purposely did not request data as a cost-cutting measure at the time (c. 2000).
<p>In the past General Electric Aviation was unwilling to sell the needed repair data to the government, and there is no reason to believe they would now. General Electric Aviation is the only known source with the specialized facilities and equipment required to repair the MicroCID. <br /><br />An offeror that has previously repaired this or a similar MicroCID, used for many aircraft, may submit a "Source Approval Request" (SAR) to the design control authority at OO-ALC (416 SCMS/GUMAC). We hope this will help clear any confusion relating to the MicroCID. If you have any questions please send them to steven.griffiths@us.af.mil and we will respond as soon as we can obtain an answer.</p>
<p>Disclaimer</p>

This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary or competition sensitive will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />PURSUANT TO FAR 10.001
<p>Purpose:<br />The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) is conducting market research (SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE) for a contractor who has the qualifications and experience to support JIEDDO's J9 Operational Analysis and Assessment Division in accordance with the PWS. <br />This is not a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations, and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract. The purpose of this notice is to identify sources, and in particular the potential capability of small business sources, for planning purposes. The intent will be to solicit and award a Time and Materials (T&amp;M) contract un FAR Part 12 for one (1) base year and two (2) one (1) year option periods with a magnitude of more than $10 million and an estimated level of effort of 46 FTEs for the base year and 34 FTEs for each option year with the an additional surge of up to 6 FTEs per year to support the tasks outlines in the PWS.</p>
<p>PART 1 - GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>1.0 Background</p>
<p>1.1 In 2006, the Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF) established the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) as an official Department of Defense (DoD) organization. In 2007, the Joint IED Defeat Capability Approval and Acquisition Management Process (JCAAMP) became a DoD directive which defined the rapid acquisition process unique to JIEDDO and its ability to quickly find, test, and deliver counter-improvised explosive device(C-IED) solutions to United States (US) and Coalition Forces. This requires an in-theater presence to ensure that JIEDDO is assisting deployed troops as much as possible.</p>
<p>1.2 The mission of JIEDDO J9 (Operations Research/Systems Analysis [ORSA]) is to conduct operations research and systems analysis to support analysis on defeating IEDs as weapons of strategic influence. In order to meet the analysis demands of the JIEDDO J9, a non-organic analysis capability must be leveraged to perform these tasks.</p>
<p>2.0 Objectives and Scope</p>
<p>2.1 Deployed Analytic Support. The contractor shall provide operational assistance to JIEDDO in support of current operations. The scope of activities includes Technology Assessment and Integration and deployed and non-deployed ORSA Support. Deployed personnel are expected to work the lesser of eighty-four (84) hours per week or per the Theater Commander's guidance. Personnel supporting units in mission training events, readiness exercises, or pre-deployment rehearsals are expected to work up to 84 hours per week during the event. Event support requiring more than 84 hours per week will be coordinated through the appropriate channels.</p>
<p>2.2 On-site Analytic Support. The contractor shall also provide Geospatial and Operational Analysis to the J9 Division, JIEDDO. The work shall be performed in Arlington, Virginia and/or other Fairfax County, Virginia locations. The J9 Division provides JIEDDO leadership with an analytically derived, empirically supported basis for decisions regarding options to minimize the impact of improvised explosive devices. All descriptions address contracted advisory assistance functions that answer to government lead oversight and provide performance to meet government-determined requirements.</p>
<p>2.3 This is a time and materials contract with one base year and two option years.</p>
<p>2.4 The contractor, as an independent contractor and not as an agent of the Government, shall provide the necessary resources; provide dedicated in-depth and integrated analytic, subject matter expertise and programmatic support.</p>

<SUBJECT>Pilot Newborn Screening Studies of Novel Technologies in a High Throughput Environment
<SOLNBR>NIH-NICHD-IDD-2014-12
<RESPDATE>031414
<CONTACT>Katharine Minker, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-402-7571, Fax 301-402-3676, Email km571h@nih.gov
<DESC>Sources Sought Notice NIH-NICHD-IDD-2014-12
<p>Pilot Newborn Screening Studies of Novel Technologies in a High Throughput Environment</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The goal of newborn screening is to detect potentially fatal or disabling conditions in newborns, thereby providing a window of opportunity for early treatment, often while the child is still asymptomatic. Such early detection and treatment can have a profound impact on the clinical severity of the condition in the affected child. If left undiagnosed and untreated, the consequences of the targeted disorders can be dire, many causing irreversible neurological damage, intellectual, developmental and physical disabilities, and even death. In 2006, the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) developed newborn screening guidelines that recommend that all newborn infants be screened for 29 "core conditions" and that 25 secondary conditions identified during the core evaluations be reported. These recommendations have been accepted by the HHS Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC) (authorized by the Children's Health Act of 2000), and by the Secretary of HHS. Most states now use this or very similar panels for newborn screening. Currently, there are thousands of rare disorders that have been identified and hundreds that could potentially benefit from newborn screening.</p>
<p>Sec. 116 of the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2007 encourages the NIH to "continue carrying out, coordinating, and expanding research in newborn screening --- including identifying, developing, and testing the most promising new screening technologies, in order to improve already existing screening tests, increasing the specificity of newborn screening, and expanding the number of conditions for which screening tests are available."</p>
<p>It has become evident that a major impediment to adding new conditions to the RUSP (recommended uniform screening panel) are the challenges related to implementing new technologies in high throughput newborn screening laboratories. The ability to provide evidence of the feasibility of the assay, both scientifically and logistically, in a timely manner is difficult. This is especially apparent when screening for rare diseases where the likelihood of detecting a single case during standard newborn screening in a single laboratory can take years. Collaborative efforts, implemented across multiple states or newborn screening laboratories, are necessary for the successful development and implementation of new assays.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to support the development of novel technologies in newborn screening. This will be accomplished by conducting pilot studies of screening tools for new and promising conditions in a high throughput newborn screening environment.</p>
<p>It is the intent of this initiative to encourage collaboration with other Federal agencies with each agency focusing on their areas of expertise in the field. The project will also leverage resources that are part of NICHD's Newborn Screening Translational Research Network (NBSTRN) including access to the Laboratory Performance Program developed to collect, aggregate and analyze de-identified screening data.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<p>To be deemed capable of performing this requirement, the offeror must submit a written capability statement that clearly demonstrates their experience and ability to provide the following capabilities:</p>
<p>&bull; Technical expertise and high throughput capacity to test for disorders using newborn dried blood spots with appropriate screening technology either immediately or with a short set up period (less than 3 months).</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to provide efficient confirmatory testing procedures for presumed positive results.</p>
<p>&bull; The capacity and resources needed for tracking positive cases.</p>
<p>&bull; The ability to arrange appropriate follow up care and referral of identified newborns in a time frame comparable to other currently used newborn screening assays.</p>
<p>&bull; An administrative structure that is conducive to prospective, rather than retrospective, pilot testing (including documentation of ability to obtain human subjects approval within 6 months of being presented with an NICHD nominated condition).</p>
<p>&bull; Documented quality assurance and quality control procedures in place for accurate assessment of findings.</p>
<p>AT THIS TIME THE NICHD IS REQUESTING CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM ALL QUALIFIED BUSINESSES. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541711.</p>
<p>All qualified businesses who believe that they have the capabilities described above are encouraged to submit a written capability statement. The Capability Statement should be limited to no more than 15 pages and it should clearly address each of the competencies stated above.</p>
<p>The written capability statement may be sent by regular U.S. Mail OR via email to the attention of Katharine Minker, Contracting Officer, by 3:00 PM local time on March 14, 2014.</p>
<p>If sending by U.S. Mail: Provide two hard copies and mail to: NIH, NICHD Office of Acquisitions, 6100 Executive Blvd., Room 7A-07 MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510.</p>
<p>If sending via email: The email address where capability statements should be emailed is minkerk@mail.nih.gov.<br /><br />NO COLLECT CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information for HEAVY LIFT FLOATING CRANE SERVICES AT THE NORFOLK NAVAL SHIPYARD (NNSY), PORTSMOUTH, VIRGINIA.


This Sources Sought Notice is a MARKET RESEARCH TOOL used to determine the availability, capability, and adequacy of potential firms to provide the services sought prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of any request for proposals (RFP).


ALL SIZE FIRMS ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND.  Upon review of industry response to this Sources Sought Notice, the Government will determine whether a set-aside acquisition in lieu of full and open competition is in the best interest of the Government.


The findings from this Market Research effort may impact any future solicitations related to this requirement.
  This Market Research is not a solicitation as defined by FAR 2.101 and the Government is not requesting offers or proposals at this time.  This is a Request for Information and does not constitute a solicitation or request for proposal.  Any responses to this Request for Information received by the Government will not be accepted to form a binding contract.  This is a market survey for planning purposes and no award will be made as a result of this Sources Sought Notice.  If a solicitation is issued, the Government does not guarantee that it will be issued to Request for Information respondents.  The Government is also requesting that restrictive or proprietary markings not be used in response to the Request for Information.
Funding is not available for any information or proposals submitted.
  Submitting information does not bind the Government for any future contracts resulting from this Request for Information.


GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), Mid-Atlantic, is seeking qualified companies that can provide Heavy Lift Floating Crane Services to lift prefabricated steel modules and related materials with a weight range, including rigging, of two hundred (200) tons to eight hundred fifty (850) tons each from delivery barges and place them into dry dock.


During August 2014 through September 2017, a United States Ship (USS) is being converted to a Moored Training Ship (MTS).  In relation, NAVFAC is seeking crane lifts during the last half of 2015 and crane lifts during late 2017 through early 2018, tentatively.
  The weight limit is set at 650 short tons per lift with a possibility, depending on the Naval Architect's Weight and Stability Studies, that the hull sections could increase from 650 short tons to 850 short tons each  with the addition of more lead ballast (if required).


Load: 850 short tons including Government provided rigging.


Reach: 74.14 feet from the front of the floating barge.


Boom Angle: as required to provide lift capacity and reach.


Crane barge must be able to reposition while holding full load capacity of 850 short tons.


The actual load is estimated at 625 short tons, plus 25 short tons of Government supplied rigging, for a total lift weight of 650 short tons.
  To assure a safe lift, the Government is requiring a design lift capacity of 850 short tons, which will provide a buffer of 200 tons of excess lift capacity.


Anticipated is a total of eight (8) actual lifts.  The lifts will be divided into two (2) sets of four (4) lifts each.  Training / practice lifts will be required to be performed prior to each of the two sets of lifts.  This will result in a total of ten (10) lifts to be done.


The Governments tentative schedule for lifts is as follows:

- Phase One Lifts: August 2015, September 2015, November 2015, and December 2015.
- Phase Two Lifts: March 2018, April 2018, June 2018, and July 2018.


SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS can be found in ATTACHMENT 1: DRAFT SCOPE OF WORK dated August 6, 2013, revised February 25, 2014.


NAICS CODE: The North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) code for this procurement is 238990, All Other Specialty Trade Contractors, having a small business size standard of $14 million.


A size standard is the largest that a concern can be and still qualify as a small business for Federal Government programs.
  For the most part, size standards are the average annual receipts or the average employment of a firm.  How to calculate average annual receipts and average employment of a firm can be found in 13 CFR  121.104 and 13 CFR  121.106, respectively.  Small Business Administration (SBA) Table of Small Business Size Standards, Footnote 13, states, NAICS code 238990 - Building and Property Specialty Trade Services: If a procurement requires the use of multiple specialty trade contractors (i.e., plumbing, painting, plastering, carpentry, etc.), and no specialty trade accounts for 50% or more of the value of the procurement, all such specialty trade contractors activities are considered a single activity and classified as Building and Property Specialty Trade Services.


CONTRACT TYPE: It is anticipated that a firm-fixed-price / indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (FFP/IDIQ) type contract with a Base Period and two one-year Option Periods will be awarded.


AWARD DATE: This office anticipates award of a contract for these services no later than June 2014.


SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS: It is requested that interested businesses capable of providing the HEAVY LIFT FLOATING CRANE SERVICES submit to the contracting office a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 25 pages in length, single-sided, single-spaced, 12 point font minimum) demonstrating the ability to perform the requested services.
  The capability package must be complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the firm's qualifications to perform the defined work.  PAGES IN EXCESS OF THE TWENTY-FIVE (25) PAGE LIMIT WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from the potential sources as a result of this synopsis.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.


The documentation shall address, at a minimum, the following:

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the US Navy as a means of market research to assess the capability and capacity of the industrial base to support TAO(X) program requirements. The Naval Sea Systems Command intends on issuing an unrestricted solicitation for the acquisition of the Navy's Fleet Replenishment Oiler Replacement (T-AO(X)) in the 2nd Quarter of FY15. The T-AO(X) will replace the U.S. Navy's legacy T-AO 187 Class Fleet Oilers, providing fuel and cargo delivery to support a full range of Fleet operations. In addition, a T-AO(X), in conjunction with a T-AKE 1 Class Dry Cargo and Ammunition ship, will operate as a "station ship," accompanying and staying on-station with a Carrier Strike Group (CSG) or Amphibious Readiness Group (ARG) to provide fuel as required. The T-AO(X) Class will be designed and constructed to meet the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Classification Steel Vessel Rules (SVR), USCG Alternate Compliance Program and Supplement, and be in compliance with Marine Pollution (MARPOL) and Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) conventions. The T-AO(X) will meet the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of 1990 "Double Hull" Standard.
<p>The Navy plans for the next contract phase (2QFY15) to support award for detail design and construction, with a planned Fiscal Year 2016 lead ship award. The current procurement plan is for a total of 17 ships, with the lead ship scheduled to deliver in 2020. To support the program, NAVSEA is conducting an Industrial Base Assessment (IBA) to assess the capability and capacity of the industrial base to support TAO(X) program requirements. As such, the Navy requests the completion of the attached Industrial Base Capabilities Assessment Questionnaire by U.S. Shipbuilders interested in the T-AO(X) program.</p>
<p>All information provided will be treated as business sensitive. Please be assured that the government does not intend to award a contract based on the information received from this RFI.</p>
<p>In conjunction with this Shipbuilders survey, the Navy is issuing separate RFIs on the industry's ability to support and provide key system and equipment components for the T-AO(X) program.</p>
<p>Companies capable of building TAO(X) ships are encouraged to submit a response. Inquires/questions concerning this announcement may be e-mailed to Mr. John Akin, john.akin@navy.mil</p>
<p>The completed questionnaire is requested by 28 March 2014 and should be submitted to;</p>

US Navy Reservists returning from deployments face unique challenges that can cause increased stress in their lives and exacerbate deployment stress injuries such as Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).
   Reservists face immense culture changes after completing a deployment, often going from a high tempo warrior community/mentality back into a more routine life where their civilian employers and family members may not understand nor be able to relate to their deployment experiences.    Reservists face access to care challenges since their eligibility and access to military or VA healthcare is dependent on a number of factors including the length of time since redeployment, timely completion of Line of Duty determination and the geographic location of the Reservists residence.  Civilian mental health insurance is often minimal, and civilian mental health providers may not be familiar with symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or Traumatic Brain Injury.
  Support or counseling services for family members may be difficult to find, especially in remote geographic locations.     BUMED uniquely designed PHOP programs to serve the needs of Reservists and their families and address long-term needs for support identify by numerous legislative and executive branch studies.   The goals of the PHOP is to  1) to create a PH safety net for  Navy Reservists and their families, who are at risk for not having their stress injuries identified and treated in an expeditious manner; 2) to improve the overall PH of Navy  Reservists and their families; and 3) to identify long-term strategies to improve PH support services for Reservists and their families.      It is intended to procure services for the provision and management of individuals at geographically diverse locations to serve as Psychological Health (PH) Outreach Coordinators and PH Outreach Support Team members.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice for a small business set aside. This is not a request for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. It is a survey to identify potential sources. The USAID/CAR team is performing this market survey to determine if an adequate number of organizations are interested in and capable of implementing and managing a complex project aimed at increasing national energy security in Central Asia.
<p><strong>Purpose/Objective</strong><br />The purpose of the Energy Links Project ("Energy Links") is to increase national energy security in Central Asia. By increasing transparent regional energy trade, improving the legal and regulatory framework and investment climate for the countries' energy sectors, improving corporate governance, operations and commercialization of the energy companies, and improving energy efficiency and demand side management, the countries of Central Asia will increase the sustainability of their energy sectors and increase their ability to provide year-round, reliable power to their citizens.<br /> For the purposes of conducting the Regional activities under the project, the region is defined as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan as well as Afghanistan and Pakistan. Regional activities include encouraging energy trade. The other planned activities as listed above are bilateral in nature. Focus countries for these activities are Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic because they are the most energy insecure, but they also have potential to be major summer exporters of hydropower. The project also targets Turkmenistan because it has potential to greatly increase year round energy exports both in Central Asia and to Afghanistan, Pakistan and beyond. <br />The outcomes that support this objective are listed below: <br />Outcome 1: Increased transparent intra- and inter-regional energy trade <br />Outcome 2: Improved legal and regulatory framework and investment climate for the countries' energy sectors <br />Outcome 3: Improved corporate governance, operations and commercialization of the energy companies<br />Outcome 4: Improved energy efficiency/demand side management</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period and Place of Performance</strong><br />The anticipated period of performance is for three years (2014-2017) for a total estimated amount of $US 20-24 million subject to funds availability.</p>
<p><strong>Submission Guidelines</strong><br />Interested organizations should submit a statement addressing the following points:<br />- Capacity of your organization to perform the work described above<br />- Business size and socio-economic status (e.g. small business, 8(a), HUBZone, etc.)<br />- Description of prior experience (Federal and Non-Federal) performing the services detailed in this sources sought notice in the past five (5) years<br />- Experience working with host country governments, donors, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders, including implementing partners on the ground<br /><br />Statements sent in response to this Sources Sought notice should not exceed three (3) single- sided pages (including attachments and charts) using an 11-point font size minimum.</p>

The Cleveland VAMC, Podiatry Section is requesting the Implants/Instruments be manufactured by Trilliant.  We currently own these sets and require more to support an increased case load at the medical center and in the new Ambulatory Surgery Center.  For the types of cases being performed, all implant trays need to be uniform to prevent errors during surgery and while re-processing.  All of the implants on the requested tray and the VA owned trays need to be 100% compatible with one another.  Due to the proprietary nature of these implants and instruments, other manufacturer's items will not be compatible.  Intermixing different manufacturer's implants/instrumentation can potentially lead to patient safety concerns.

   
The Government believes that only one business can satisfy the agency requirements and intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106(b) - access to proprietary information. Other persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by Wednesday, March 7, 2014. Such capabilities information will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. No solicitation is available at this time.    All inquiries must be submitted by email to Rachelle Hamer at rachelle.hamer@va.

The following solicitation has hereby been cancelled in accordance with FAR 14.209 (a) (2).   Due to the age and configuration of the current cable TV system here at Durham, in the long run it would be more cost effective to install a complete new system than to piecemeal patch the existing system.  Our existing system is an antiquated analog system, and all the new equipment and system providers are digital.  All prospective bidders will be given an opportunity to bid on any resolicitation of bids or any future requirements for the type of supplies or service involved.

<DESC>Description: NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE<br />The Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center, Port Hueneme, CA intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis in approximately May2014 to four vendors.
<p>The&nbsp;four contractors shall provide 2 water purification units each. The small unit water purifier must be man portable, capable of treating brackish, fresh, and salt water from sources up to 45000 ppm. The unit must produce 16 gallons per hour and a minimum of 200 gallons per day from a salt water source. The desired capability is 50 gallons per hour and 400 gallons per day from a fresh water source. The power requirements must be compatible with a 2K generator, meet the TB MED 577 standard to include a chlorine residual for water not immediately consumed, and operate between 32 and 120 degrees Fahrenheit. <br /><br />Government market research has identified 57 products and 26 vendors&nbsp;with potential. Based on analysis, four products will be field tested to refine the Government's need. It is not practical to purchase and test each unit on the market, and the Government can best refine its requirements through iterative assessments of several products identified through market research to closely meet some or all of the requirements.</p>
<p>NAVFAC EXWC intends to execute this action as four sole source awards of approximately $25K each, solely for the purpose of obtaining two units for limited evaluation in order to refine the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>The sole source awards will not result in a follow-on procurement.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 333318. This notice of intent is not a request for proposals or quotes.</p>

The Project is for Drill Rig Repair/Upgrade Master BPA.  The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and  other items and non-personal services necessary to perform service for drilling rig repair, maintenance, and upgrade and is being processed under the NAICS Code 811310, Commercial and Industrial machinery and Equipment (except Automotive and Electronic) Repair and Maintenance.    The Omaha District currently owns and operates three drill rigs which were originally designed, manufactured, and assembled by Gus Pech Manufacturing, Co., Inc. Gus Pech is the only company with the detailed knowledge of the operational parameters of the rigs necessary to ensure that any repairs and/or upgrades are done properly and within the original tolerances of the equipment.  There are dozens of integrated parts and systems within these very complex drills that must operate in harmony in order to safely perform drilling operations.  If any repairs and/or upgrades are not properly integrated into the machines, the government could potentially lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional repair costs, lost productivity, and personnel safety risk.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to award a sole-source contract in the amount of $69,220.00 to NeurOptics, Inc. for the purchase of NPi-100 Pupillometers with associated NPi-100 Headsets and Printer Kits, PLR-200 Pupillometers and DP-2000 Pupillometers; to be used for research studies in the Visual Sciences Branch of the Sensory Research Division (SRD) located at the United States Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL).  The SRD maintains a unique capability in applied medical and operational research in the areas of visual and auditory sciences.  The research mission of the Division is to conduct sensory research to protect, sustain and extend the operational capabilities of our Army's Warfighters.  These objectives include conducting applied medical research in the areas of (a) eye and ear injury prevention; (b) development of  sensory biomarkers (e.g., electrophysiological, behavioral, and clinical) for the evaluation of visual, auditory, and vestibular consequences of traumatic brain injury and fitness for duty criteria development; (c) development of realistic models for the assessment of protection technologies and sensing performance with these technologies; (d) development of unique visual and auditory standards for service occupations and performance standards for optical, acoustical and communication devices; and (e) establishment of  a sensory performance research base to support the  development and integration of soldier technologies (e.g., night vision devices, hearing protection, communications equipment, advanced optical systems, etc.) into military systems. The pupillometers are solely manufactured and distributed by NeurOptics Inc. located at 2082 Michelson Dr. Ste. 450, Irvine, CA 92612 in the United States.  The NPi-100 is the only device containing the Neurological Pupil index (NPi) software, which has been shown to correlate to increased intracranial pressure and other brain dysfunction. The NeurOptics  PLR-200 pupillometer is a research grade human pupillometer, and is a stand-alone hand-held pupillometer capable of measuring pupil size and the pupillary light reaction.  The measurements for this device are taken monocularly.  Data stored on this device may be uploaded to a laptop or printed; light stimulus intensity, duration may be set.  The DP-2000 pupillometer is a stand-alone human desktop pupillometer capable of measuring both eyes (binocular) at once via a dual camera system.  It makes multiple consecutive measurements of pupil response and saves pupil trajectory and light stimulus data in a file for external/independent analysis.  It has automatic tracking and pupil detection, and graphic result display with autoscale to maximize visibility.  The government does not intend to post a solicitation for this requirement nor is this a request for a solicitation or competitive proposals.  However, if a company believes it could meet or exceed all the needs of the United States Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory for this requirement, it may submit documentation as such (i.e. a proposal, quote or capabilities statement) and any reasonable offer shall be considered by this agency.  All responses to this notice must clearly indicate to the Government that pursuing competition in future procurements would be advantageous.  If qualified sources are not presented to the Government by a response to this notice, then a contract shall be awarded in accordance with Other than Full and Open Competition procedures, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1); only one responsible source, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies and Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  This notice of intent to sole source does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in the response.  The Government reserves the right not to compete this requirement.   <br> Any qualified offerors must respond in writing no later than Wednesday 12 March 2014 by 9:00AM Eastern Standard Time to USAMRAA, Attn: Lisa Walters, Lisa.D.Walters13.civ@mail.mil.  Any responses received after this date and time will not be considered.  Any response documentation received shall become the property of the Government.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Disposable Patient Exam Clothing - Gowns. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Disposable Patient Exam Clothing - Gowns products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Disposable Patient Exam Clothing - Gowns. The QSL for Disposable Patient Exam Clothing - Gowns will be established approximately February 2014 and will be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately March 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Disposable Patient Exam Clothing - Gowns. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Disposable Patient Exam Clothing- Gowns.</p>
<p><strong>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br /></strong>The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Disposable Patient Exam Clothing- Gowns. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual volume in sales of $181,346.96. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. One product group of Disposable Patient Exam Clothing- Gowns represents the clinically significant product groups for the QSL. The one product is considered the requirement for addition to the QSL and accounts for 100% ($238,049) of the total volume in sales in the MHS. The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.</p>
<p><strong>B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in being added to the QSL will provide a response to the FBO Sources Sought notification via e-mail to the POCs below.</strong> The vendor's responses will include detailed information requested in the requirements listed in the FBO Sources Sought notification and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Pacific that its submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO Pacific via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt; allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>Vendor must complete and submit the FBO Package Worksheet.</strong> A vendor who cannot open the FBO Package Worksheet may contact the POC as noted in the FBO Sources Sought notification and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). After evaluation of the requested information, vendors who meet initial requirements will be provided ship to addresses and requested to provide required products for evaluation as indicated in Evaluation paragraph below.<strong> Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for subsequent participation in the planned Standardization Action. Submissions received after the date listed for closing will be reviewed periodically and vendors will be notified of whether they met or did not meet the QSL requirements within approximately 240 days.*<br /><br /></strong>*NOTE: The QSL established as a result of this sources sought notification will remain open beyond the scope of this announcement. Only those vendors on the QSL at the time of the Incentive Agreement (IA) announcement will be eligible for the subsequent standardization action (SA). Vendor submissions received after the original response date may not be qualified in time to be eligible for the anticipated SA.</p>
<p><strong>C. Source Selection Procedures<br /></strong>The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection for the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p><br /><strong>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</strong></p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Justice, Justice Management Division, intends to procure on a sole source basis an online enterprise subscription to Law360 from Portfolio Media. Due to the proprietary nature of this publication, Portfolio Media is the only known source for this publication.

Law360 is the only source that provides extensive coverage of current litigation and issues across a broad spectrum of legal topics, from Banking and Environmental to Product Liability and White Collar Crime, and includes coverage of law firms, government agencies, and companies as well. No other source provides the ease of use, daily coverage, and ready access to important documents all in one search, and includes expert analysis on top legal topics on a daily basis. For example, Law360 allows for ready access to news on a particular company, and that news will include litigation, documents, general activities, etc. - no other single source readily provides this information.

Responses received as a result of this notice of intent shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses will not be considered as either bids or proposals. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon the written responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses to this notice must be submitted to Dale.Park@usdoj.gov. No telephone responses will be accepted.</p>

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

It is the Government's belief that Parker Hannifin is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items.  Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.

Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew.  Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, a certificate of conformance and traceability to the OEM.  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  

The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. Certificate of Conformance must be submitted in the format specified in the clause.  All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.

NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED.  ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED. 

The Government reserves the right to withhold any item or group of items contained in this solicitation upon award.  The Government reserves the right to make a single award, no award, or multiple awards if after considering the additional administrative costs it is in the Governments best interest to do so.  The Government shall assume, for the purpose of making multiple awards, that $500 would be the administrative cost to the Government for issuing and administering each contract awarded under this solicitation.  Individual awards shall be for the items or combinations of items that result in the lowest cost to the Government including the assumed administrative costs.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.<br />To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 14 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Program Manager is a member of one of DCHA/OTI's Regional Teams in the Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, DC.  OTI currently has five regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division (FPD): Asia, Africa (AFR), Afghanistan/Pakistan (Af/Pak), Latin America and Caribbean (LAC), and Middle East (ME).  OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>The Program Manager's principal responsibility is to assist one of OTI's regional teams in the administration and management of existing country programs and participate in new country program assessments as the need arises.  This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus approximately 80% of time on country program implementation, and approximately 20% of time on strategic planning and program development.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Program Manager that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  She or he places a premium on building positive relationships with his or her respective team, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of OTI.  The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The incumbent is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Regional Team Leader or his/her designee (e.g. the Senior Program Manager), the Program Manager will:</p>

<p>&bull;	Prepare documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements;</p>

<p>&bull;	In limited circumstances, the incumbent may be required to provide assistance to organizations outside of OTI but within the current scope of work, where such assistance would enhance both OTI's goals and objectives as well as the incumbent's job skills;</p>
<p>&bull;	With supervisor, participate in design and implementation of new country program operations to include management, logistical, budget, administrative, personnel and contractual issues;</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by Embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick impact programming model.

<p>&bull;	When required, participate on inter-office, inter-bureau, or inter-agency committees where issues relate to OTI's program goals;</p>

<p>&bull;	Develop, monitor, evaluate and recommend performance measures for country programs and individual projects, including the work of contractors and grantees;</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>652.225-71 SECTION 8(A) OF THE EXPORT ADMINISTRATION ACT OF 1979, AS AMENDED (AUG 1999)</p>

The Boycott of Israel by Arab League countries is such a boycott, and therefore, the following actions, if taken with intent to comply with, further, or support the Arab League Boycott of Israel, are prohibited activities under the Export Administration Act:<br />(1) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to do business with or in Israel, with any Israeli business concern, or with any national or resident of Israel, or with any other person, pursuant to an agreement of, or a request from or on behalf of a boycotting country;<br />(2) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to employ or otherwise discriminating against any person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin of that person or of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such person;<br />(3) Furnishing information with respect to the race, religion, or national origin of any U.S. person or of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such U.S. person;<br />(4) Furnishing information about whether any person has, has had, or proposes to have any business relationship (including a relationship by way of sale, purchase, legal or commercial representation, shipping or other transport, insurance, investment, or supply) with or in the State of Israel, with any business concern organized under the laws of the State of Israel, with any Israeli national or resident, or with any person which is known or believed to be restricted from having any business relationship with or in Israel;<br />(5) Furnishing information about whether any person is a member of, has made contributions to, or is otherwise associated with or involved in the activities of any charitable or fraternal organization which supports the State of Israel; and,<br />(6) Paying, honoring, confirming, or otherwise implementing a letter of credit which contains any condition or requirement against doing business with the State of Israel.</p>
<p>(b) Under Section 8(a), the following types of activities are not forbidden ``compliance with the boycott,'' and are therefore exempted from Section 8(a)'s prohibitions listed in paragraphs (a)(1)-(6) above:<br />(1) Complying or agreeing to comply with requirements:<br />(i) Prohibiting the import of goods or services from Israel or goods produced or services provided by any business concern organized under the laws of Israel or by nationals or residents of Israel; or,<br />(ii) Prohibiting the shipment of goods to Israel on a carrier of Israel, or by a route other than that prescribed by the boycotting country or the recipient of the shipment;<br />(2) Complying or agreeing to comply with import and shipping document requirements with respect to the country of origin, the name of the carrier and route of shipment, the name of the supplier of the shipment or the name of the provider of other services, except that no information knowingly furnished or conveyed in response to such requirements may be stated in negative, <br />blacklisting, or similar exclusionary terms, other than with respect to carriers or route of shipments as may be permitted by such regulations in order to comply with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks and confiscation;<br />(3) Complying or agreeing to comply in the normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, or national or resident thereof, of carriers, insurance, <br />suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country or specific goods which, in the normal course of business, are identifiable by source when imported into the boycotting country;<br />(4) Complying or agreeing to comply with the export requirements of the boycotting country relating to shipments or transshipments of exports to Israel, to any business concern of or organized under the laws of Israel, or to any national or resident of Israel;<br />(5) Compliance by an individual or agreement by an individual to comply with the immigration or passport requirements of any country with respect to such individual or any member of such individual's family or with requests for information regarding requirements of employment of such individual within the boycotting country; and,<br />(6) Compliance by a U.S. person resident in a foreign country or agreement by such person to comply with the laws of that country with respect to his or her activities exclusively therein, and such regulations may contain exceptions for such resident complying with the laws or regulations of that foreign country governing imports into such country of trademarked, trade named, or similarly specifically identifiable products, or components of products for his or her own use, including the performance of contractual services within that country, as may be defined by such regulations.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>Total Evaluated Price (TEP): Price proposals will be evaluated based on the TEP. The TEP will be calculated as the sum of the Offeror's proposed prices for a basic period, all option year periods (4 years), and 6-month extensions. Evaluation of options/extensions shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options or extensions. The TEP will be used for evaluation purposes only. Proposed pricing for the 6-month extension will be based on each Option period to determine the total evaluated price. IAW FAR 52.217-8, offerors should not propose different pricing for each 6-month extension. The rate should be based on that period's monthly rate. For example, the monthly rate used for CLIN 0002 should be the same rate used for CLIN 0001.</p>
<p>The 6-month extension of services is IAW FAR 52.217-8, "Option to Extend Services" and will only be utilized if necessary. The 6-month extension of services is not to be considered part of the Option Year periods and will be a separate option exercise if it is utilized. However, proposed pricing for the 6-month extension will be based on the current performance period's (base or subsequent option year) pricing as detailed in Section B of the resulting contract.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Disposable Patient Exam Clothing - Gowns. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong></p>
<p>These Disposable Patient Exam Clothing - Gowns products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Disposable Patient Exam Clothing - Gowns. The QSL for Disposable Patient Exam Clothing - Gowns will be established approximately February 2014 and will be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately March 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Disposable Patient Exam Clothing - Gowns. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Disposable Patient Exam Clothing- Gowns.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Disposable Patient Exam Clothing- Gowns. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $181,346.96. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. One product group of Disposable Patient Exam Clothing- Gowns represents the clinically significant product groups for the QSL. The one product is considered the requirement for addition to the QSL and accounts for 100% ($238,049) of the total volume in sales in the MHS. The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC>02/26/2014<br />RFQ14-PHX-07<br />Q&amp;A #2<br /><br />1.<br />Q: The SOW says pick-up are quarterly, but you answered a question on the fbo.gov site that says the pick-ups should be weekly. Could you please clarify the service frequency?<br />A: Pick up is currently weekly. Though we don't generate massive volumes of regulated medical waste, I think a weekly (or, at most, bi-weekly) pick up is wise.
<p>&nbsp;2. <br />Q:The SOW says hazardous and radioactive waste may be included. These are separate waste streams that have very different regulations on how they can be disposed. By law, these waste streams cannot be commingled.</p>
<p>A: I suspect that SOW relied heavily on boilerplate items. I am not aware of any radioactive waste that we currently generate or dispose of. I know that our dental department does X-rays, but considering they recently disposed of the lead shields they no longer used, that suggests they're not generating any radioactive waste either.</p>
<p>The scope of work should really only include the red bags for regulated medical waste and the sharps containers.</p>
<p><br />3. <br />Q: What size container is the facility using?<br />A: The container is roughly a 4 cubic yard container. As far as I know, we don't fill the entire area between pick up dates.</p>
<p>The scope of work will be revised to include the&nbsp;following;&nbsp;<br />1. Bi-weekly pickup and quarterly billing <br />2.&nbsp;Include the red bags for regulated medical waste and the sharp containers only.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

<DESC>Amendment 0001- The purpose of this amendment is to address contractor's questions. Attached is the Government's response to the questions. The response date remains March 6, 2014 at 12:00 PM (EST).
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. QUESTION: Would the already existing hardware be used, or do you need a quote on new hardware? In case of the latter, what are the requirements?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Existing customized hardware will be used. However, all related contract work progress customizations (software mainly and minor hardware) are to be delivered by the vendor.</p>
<p>2. QUESTION: Do you expect that the system be validated (as per CFR 21 part 11)?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Yes, the system will be validated per CFR 21 Part 11.</p>
<p>3. QUESTION: What is the expected throughput of the system (including any anticipated variations in time or growth projections)?</p>
<p>ANSWER: The estimated throughput is 2000-3000 samples or slides (whole image analysis) per day. They should be scalable per need/demand up to ~5000/samples or slide analyses a day.</p>
<p>4. QUESTION: For parallel execution, has the architecture been decided upon? Are there any components that are already known to be suitable for a specific parallel architecture (for instance, embarrassingly parallel tasks), or should the contractor research the business process at AFRRI to determine the suitable architecture?</p>
<p>ANSWER: No. It is open to rational scientific plans/architecture for parallel execution, as long as at a minimal data and tasks are parallel executed on multi-core cluster/grid. Part of implementation is to develop multi-core custom architecture for High-throughput performance and down the line integration to similar Bio-IT approaches on the same platform. AFRRI business process (architecture) is not open for public implementation (closed system). The Contractor is expected to develop a custom independent testing/validation plan with clear controls for in-house network folks to determine the suitability and integration of the developed architecture.</p>
<p>5. QUESTION: Where can we see the ACAP HT-MMS system flowchart, mentioned in the Solicitation, but not included with the package?</p>
<p>ANSWER: The ACAP HT-MMS flow-chart has been intentionally removed from the solicitation due to the proprietary research data/plan in the flow chart. The flow chart will be given after the award and the Contractor can consult the program head prior to the start of work (post the award).</p>
<p><br />6. QUESTION: Has the database management system been selected? The Solicitation mentions PostgreSQL and MySQL in different paragraphs.</p>
<p>ANSWER: No, the database management hasn't been selected. It is the contractor's responsibility to make sure the system supports the requirements of the SOW. Refer to the &lsquo;Database Design, development and Implementation' section of the RFQ to gather the requirements and implementation plan. A reasonable expectation to put together a flow-chart/architecture based on SOW is appreciated. The Solicitation mentions PostgreeSQL/MySQL as expected directions.</p>
<p>7. QUESTION: What are the external data sources and "well-known Bioinformatics and Bio databank applications" that the system should interface to?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Several external data sources and "well-known Bioinformatics and Bio databanks applications"(but expandable) are BioGraph, GenBank, NCBI Toolkit, BioCarta, KEGG, mGen, EBI,BIND, Pfam, Rfam, and STRING.</p>
<p>8. QUESTION: What are "high- performance machine-optimized numerical integration and scientific computation packages" that the system should integrate with?</p>
<p>ANSWER: The system should integrate with proprietary in-house source/packages plus various packages from public domain that are used for assay/SOW and analyses.</p>
<p>9. QUESTION: Has it been decided what type/model of temperature and humidity sensing devices would be used? Is it known what the business process for data capture from the shipping containers would be?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Telatemp/Sensotronic device should be use. <br /><br />10. QUESTION: What LIMS system is AFRRI using?</p>
<p>ANSWER: AFRRI is using a highly customized version of ATL LIMS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. QUESTION: Is this a follow-on requirement? If so, could you please provide the incumbent contract number for this opportunity? If not, is this a new requirement?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Yes, this requirement was previously procured under contract, HT9404-13-M-0676. <br />12. QUESTION: Does the project involve fabricating an automated high throughput microscopy system, for acquisition of images from samples that have been processed for visualization of interphase dicentric chromosome aberration? Or, alternatively, does the USUHS already have the instrumentation?</p>
<p>ANSWER: The Project demands very little fabrication but enormous amount of customization to use the existing digital microscopic pathology platform that has been used for other likewise typical imaging. Design, development, validation and implementation of high- throughput image capture/analyses algorithm that can be adapted for parallel computing is EXPECTED as end-result/deliverable.<br />13. QUESTION: Does the USUHS need to design image analysis algorithms that will recognize interphase dicentric chromosome aberrations? The solicitation specifies that consultant(s) will be hired to develop the system, but most of the qualifications that are discussed seem relevant to data base management, rather than digital image analysis.</p>
<p>ANSWER: The Contractor needs to design image analyses algorithms that will recognize the Dicentric chromosome aberration; this is the deliverable expected from the contractor and USUHS does not provide this. Design, development, validation and implementation of high-throughput image capture/analyses algorithm that can be adapted for parallel computing is EXPECTED as end-result.</p>
<p>The solicitation specifications should be treated as a minimal framework of expectation to be competent to complete the tasks and quite impossible to narrate and enlist all the expertise/skillset needed for the project. A clear expertise in digital image analyses and high-content image screening will be useful to fulfill the task under the solicitation.</p>
<p>A clear understanding of the SOW/Solicitation is minimally expected for a consultant to determine their ability for fulfilling the tasks under solicitation and should be put forward in response to the solicitation for award consideration.</p>
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This requirement is set-aside for small businesses only.<br />The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), located on the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), Bethesda, MD, intends to solicit offers for a consultant(s) to assist developing a cytogenetic biodosimetry system to estimate radiation doses in radiation accidents and overexposures. <br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

<p>2.0 Introduction and Overview</p>
<p>Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI), a tri-service biomedical research laboratory chartered in 1961 and a major component of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, conducts research in the field of radiobiology and related matters essential to the operational and medical support of the U.S. Department of Defense and the military services. The institute collaborates with other governmental facilities, academic institutions, and civilian laboratories in the United States and other countries. Its findings have broad military and civilian applications.</p>
<p>In support of AFRRI/USU and the Dodd military mission, the project Principal Investigator and his lab has established international protocols and have identified the use of gold standard radiation biomarkers to estimate radiation doses in radiation accidents and overexposures. The PI is a SME (subject matter expert) of Artificial Intelligence and Automated systems and has set up a high-throughput prototype system CLASP that has been recognized as a great tool for use during a radiation or nuclear mass-casualty emergency. The entire system demands the use of many robotic instruments and high-throughput automated systems to meet the sample analysis demands and throughput. The whole system is supported by a high-performing computing infrastructure controlled by AI and Bayesian system using neural networking and contextual image mapping framework integrated with high performing computing architecture.</p>
<p><br />3.0 Project Background</p>
<p>Nuclear/radiological exposure risk is eminent and several thousands of individuals may be exposed to radiation in worst-case scenarios. Radiation mass casualties will demand high-throughput individual diagnostic dose assessment for medical management of exposed subjects. Many established cytogenetic assays are generally manually performed, either in part or in whole, and are inadequate for high-throughput requirements, particularly during radiation mass casualty. Because current medical intervention guidelines encourage early administration of cytokines and supportive therapy, timely identification of radiation casualties who will benefit from medical intervention in radiation disasters is critical.</p>
<p>Cytogenetic techniques are considered as the "Gold Standard" biological dosimeters for medical management and triage during nuclear radiation mass casualty. In the last decade, a variety of new biodosimetric assays have evolved; Gamma-H2AX, micronuclei, premature chromatin condensation assays etc. Besides these established assays, several new reliable technologies like electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) dosimetry, gene expression profiling, nanovesicle hydrocell and DNA microarrays are rapidly gaining importance. These technologies are also very useful for the clinical assessment of biological effects of Ionizing Radiation, understanding transcriptome modulations, relational analysis of gene expression data, establishing gene signatures for early transient responses which are of very high interest to the radiobiology and military community and can assist during triage of radiation mass casualty.</p>
<p>4.0 Goals/Objectives</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to develop a rapid, high-throughput, radiation-specific diagnostic biodosimetry system Inter-phase Dicentric Chromosomes Aberrations (IDCA) for individual diagnostic dose estimation, highly specific to radiation exposure, and with a better operating dose-range than the current gold-standard metaphase-spread Dicentric Chromosomes Aberrations (DCA). The project wants to establish an independent ultra-high-throughput radiation dose specific analytical system which can be operational and usable on a cytogenetic laboratory automation platform. The system prototype developed should be integrated with Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) and should be inter-reportable with complementary biodosimetric assays. The prototype should be able to enumerate and score the image attributes, spatial and spectral features for IDCA. An automatic feature extraction algorithm to support and enhance the specificity and sensitivity of the platform has to be developed and integrated. The system should be able to validate the large-scale sample processing capabilities of the automated high-throughput robotic cytogenetic system for the preparation of abridged short-term whole-blood micro-culture and metaphase spreads for the IDCA. The entire system should be ready to be tested and validated against manual scoring of the samples, should be capable of integration into existing platform and be scalable based on the timely requirements and demands. The prototype should adapt Rational Unified Process and Machine Learning approaches using Vector training and Bayesian algorithms.</p>
<p><br />5.0 Scope of Work</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to develop an AI-supported high-throughput computational platform, called IDCA to gather and analyze biomarkers and aberrations, expression signatures for radioprotection and biodosimetry. The platform and other auxiliary programming should be supported by Supervised Learning Models (SLMs) for mass-scale analysis and data mining from multitude of disparate data sources.<br />The system should demonstrate automated feature extraction; attribute analysis, storage and integration of cross platform radiation specific biomarker and associated gene expression establishing a high-throughput platform for triage during military medical operation and DOD mission during radiation mass casualty. The platform and its supporting systems should be able to assist in processing of larger-scale sample sets. It should be able to establish baseline requirements thereby assisting in further understanding of processing capacity, vertical, horizontal scalability and addition of other supplementary/complementary biological information repositories.</p>
<p>The long-term goal is to develop high-throughput, accurate and specific radiation dose diagnostic assessment platform which can provide efficient and quick help to the military medical operations during mass casualty scenarios.</p>
<p>There are four (4) major deliverables within the scope of this project with a time frame of two (2) years. All four (4) major deliverables have to be performed and many concurrently to meet the required scientific milestones of the project. The sub-tasks under each deliverable have to be performed in the same sequence as determined by the project PI, unless upon discussion a scientific rationale is arrived by consensus and the project PI authorizes in writing, the change of the sequence of the sub-tasks of the deliverables.<br />6.0 Tasks and Deliverables<br /><br />The deliverables are sequentially dependent and provide progressive basis for high-throughput ACAP infrastructure development. It's expected that each sub-task should be followed/implemented sequentially to complete each deliverable to deem as completed deliverable for invoicing.</p>
<p>1. Automated Cytogenetic Analyses Platform; Design &amp; Implementation</p>
<p>The Automated Cytogenetic Analyses Platform (ACAP) HT-MMS system flowchart below gives a very detailed flow chart of the expected deliverables: design, implementation, testing &amp; integration with the existing already developed platform (hardware and software integration). ACAP should be built upon available hardware and software components and should be ready to be highly customized for specific applications. The ACAP system should be able to significantly reduces human error in performing repetitive tasks, help in increasing productivity and throughput, free lab personnel and helps in providing more repetitive and reliable scientific reliable data obtained using good laboratory practice (GLP) guidelines. The entire ACAP pipeline which would include the entire robotic engineered system for high-throughput along with all the system components fully integrated and enclosed in a lab safety level-II enclosure should be implemented on a flexible 2-ply delivery system with the specific deliverables or milestones set within each sub-task. The hardware architecture for base platform implementation should be designed and set forth to provide sample management and administration of required cytogenetic assays. The system should support concurrent execution of multiple analysis jobs per biomarker/array and generation of per-well output. Platform should support high-quality data and attribute extraction. Perform Operating System implementation; hardware fabrication, network connectivity to local nodes; user control for information segregation. The system design should be capable of parallel execution and use of grid-based computing facilities such as SGE, MPI-CH or MPI-CH2. The platform should be able to utilize batch processing facilities and cross-cluster linkages for temporal information retrieval. Horizontal expansion of computation capacity should be supported through addition of array-worker nodes. A reporting console a.la web-based management dashboard should be provided in order to manage platform system components. Develop, integrate and customize an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). Fabricate and design a prototype platform implementation which will support multi-faceted and concurrent execution of numerous biomarker/array analysis jobs. Accounting, Authorization and Authentication (AAA) management system should be designed and implemented to integrate highly customized message service bus-based plugin architecture with an object-oriented matching search interface.<br />Utilization of a component based architecture. Perform testing of platform prototype scalability; benchmark bandwidth and connectivity; hardware programming of platform resources to utilize I/O tunneling. Integrate with existing network and LIMS architecture with scatter/gather-style capabilities; benchmark bandwidth &amp; connectivity, feasibility, validation and proof-of-principle for VPN, debugging and system validation along with user documentation. Implementation of tools and programming to support modeling of biomarker data sets. Facilitate high-throughput performance requirements of analyzing incoming biomarker and dosimetry data points from multiple sources. Perform hardware and software programming for multi-core enhanced software libraries (MPI, OpenMP, etc) and processor- specific data copy-in/copy-out assembly/op-codes. Rapid servicing and dispatch of incoming requests on timely basis to keep scheduling pipeline fully saturated. Use N-tier architecture for platform scalability and resource utilization flexibility in processing of numerous microarray configurations at a time.<br />2. Database Design, Development and Implementation</p>
<p><br />Design Entity Relationship Models (ERMs) for the underlying database information store. Appropriate use case models should be developed for interaction with the DB entities and schemas. Support storage of ephemeral or permanent data points and other information vectors onto MySQL-backend systems. Schema should utilize compact data types for space efficiency in order to support large data sets. Implement high-throughput DB-level clustering for latency reduction in I/O tunneling. Concurrent access from multi-core kernels should be supported on the Schemas. Implement a caching engine to mediate between the database servers and client processes and threads.</p>
<p><br /><br />Perform system compatibility analysis with POSTGRESS/SQL for object-oriented database management extensions; SQL scripts for data query and data analyses, optimized search organization, heterogeneous systems data portability checks. Integrate the database information views with existing LIMS backend storage. Perform user bandwidth testing; packet transmission checks; Read/Write/Update latency analysis and delay assessments. Implement entity and schema- level optimizations using partitioning and master/slave-style replication for performance. DB management system should perform load among multiple slaves to improve performance. In this environment, all writes and updates must take place on the master server. Reads, however, may take place on one or more slaves. Stored procedures and subroutines should be built into the DBMS to reduce query execution times for rapid analysis operations per array worker.<br />Cross-link with external data sources and perform scheduled management for automatic update and synchronization, in order to facilitate rapid and updated cross-analysis. The software should interface with well-known Bioinformatics and Bio databank application programming interfaces, ABIs and libraries. In addition, the system should integrate with high- performance machine-optimized numerical integration and scientific computation packages.<br />3. Cytogenetic Environmental Monitoring Sensory Network<br /><br />Designing and Implement a Cytogenetic Environmental Monitoring Sensory Network; various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and wetness play a huge role in the QC/QA mechanisms, results and obtainable throughput. A direct co-relation can be established with some of these factors and its effect on overall sensitivity and specificity of cytogenetic assays and their underlying statistical models for dose estimation. Temperature and humidity affects samples over time, which will consequently affect the quality of slides that are prepared for scoring Dicentric and IDCA. Keeping an effective record and monitoring of all the temperature and humidity changes in the environment, among other environmental sensory vectors is essential for achieving higher quality end-point assay results and co-relating it with current and/or archived experiments in the HT-MMS for scientific purposes. Highly accurate network-enabled environmental sensors for temperature, humidity, wetness as well as data loggers to track temperature within shipping containers should be integrated into shipments of blood samples for radiation biodosimetry. Each of the outlined sub task should be followed to design and implement an effective Cytogenetic Environmental Monitoring Sensory Network.</p>

<p>4. Extended Supervisory Spread Discrimination Application</p>
<p><br />Design an extended supervisory spread discrimination application to discriminate metaphase cell spreads from whole slide imaging device at various low magnifications at ultra-high-throughput. The application should be able to discriminate metaphase cell spreads from whole slide imaging device at various low magnifications at using high- throughput processing layer. The system should be capable of using advanced spread classification capabilities based on multi-parametric quasi-supervised AI-supported collection of inference algorithms. The Schema-enabled backbone should be able to support essential map/reduce style capabilities in order to exploit latest advances in parallel processing technologies. The application should also support bio-statistical profiling exports in order to support other event processors in the ACAP analyses pipeline.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.)

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit quotes in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.

Brothers Elizabeth City, NC 27909 NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

That RFI had instructions that were updated, but the updated instructions for the RFI contained information regarding the industry day (the subject of this notice) that were confusing when read with the instructions of this notice. Those RFI instructions also contained an incorrect e-mail address. This modification is to provide additional time to register for industry day due to the confusion. Please see the updated documents. If you previously registered <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AND</span></strong> you have received an e-mail confirming receipt of your registration from PCO, Peggy Japngie Lizotte, it is not necessary to register again. However, if you have not received an e-mail, please follow the attached instructions to register.

<DESC>Q&amp;A:<br /><br /><br />Q.&nbsp; "[We have been]advised that it would be too late to submit a SAR package last month following the release of the RFI, even though we are currently overhauling a very similar actuator..."<br /><br />A.&nbsp;I am not sure as to why your company has been advised that it is "too late" to submit a SAR package. It should never be "too late" to submit a SAR package. A SAR package should be accepted any time one is submitted, regardless of the stage of the acquisition or even if there is an active RFI/RFP/etc. or not. While your company might not obtain qualification before award of this specific requirement, once your company is determined to be a qualified source, your company would be included in the qualified source list for all future acquisitions of this same requirement. Therefore, I highly encourage your company (and any other interested sources) to submit a SAR package. Based upon the acquisition time line, there still seems to be a reasonable amount of time left for review and consideration of a SAR package. Although, please keep in mind that we cannot guarantee your company will receive a response before award. Should your SAR package become approved before award, and your company had submitted an offer BEFORE the RFP closed, the offer could then be considered for award (assuming it was otherwise evaluated as technically acceptable IAW section M of the RFP).

<DESC>This is a special notice to announce a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) for commercial or non-commercial wipe technologies which are capable of meeting the requirements described in the DRFP. This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB). A DRFP is not a formal solicitation tool, rather it is used to gather comments and suggestions from potential offerors prior to the release of a final solicitation, if any.  This notice is not a guarantee that a final solicitation will be issued, nor does it commit the Government to release a final solicitation at any time.  Any responses to this notice are not considered as offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information presented or the use of any such information.  <br>    <br>  The Product Manager for the Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS) under the Joint Project Manager for Protection (JPM P) has a requirement for a Joint Service Equipment Wipe (JSEW), which may either be a commercial or non-commercial wipe technology, that will provide immediate/operational decontamination capabilities for sensitive and non-sensitive equipment in hostile and non-hostile environments that have been exposed to chemical agents/contamination.  The JSEW will be capable of producing a quantifiable reduction in gross chemical contamination while maintaining the functionality of equipment. This capability will significantly enhance how the Warfighter executes immediate, operational, thorough, and clearance decontamination for chemical agents. JSEW addresses known issues with current decontaminants, which are corrosive and damaging to optics and electronics, by allowing the Warfighter to effectively maintain operational effectiveness of contaminated sensitive and non-sensitive equipment.  <br>    <br>  The DRFP will be posted to the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website, at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi and will also available through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website https://www.fbo.gov/ under the controlling document number W911QY-14-R-0002.  <br>    <br>  Questions and comments regarding this DRFP shall be sent in writing via e-mail to the Contract Specialist, Jean Greenwood, at jean.t.greenwood.civ@mail.mil and submitted not later than 14 February, 2014. Questions received in response to this DRFP will be posted to the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website, at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi and will also available through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website https://www.fbo.gov/. <br>  <br> Questions and Answers (Q&A) received through the end date for questions for the DRAFT RFP, and posted as of 26 February 2014, are now available at the link below.

<DESC>Synopsis: <br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued for planning purposes, as defined in FAR 15.201(e). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The Department of Defense (DoD) is not seeking proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals. This notice is open to all sources.
<p>Background and Mission: <br />The mission of DTRA-Research and Development Enterprise (RD)-Chemical and Biological Directorate Technologies Directorate (CB) (DTRA-RD-CB), is to develop scientific knowledge, technical solutions and deliver Medical Counter Measures to reduce the chemical and biological threat to the military and the Nation. As part of this mission DTRA CB/JSTO seeks to initiate programs and deliver "Medical Counter Measures" (MCMs) against tier 1 infectious threat pathogens. Tier 1 list includes bacterial threat pathogens (natural or engineered) for which effective MCMs are required for preparedness.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: <br />The objective of this RFI is to identify candidate Small organic Molecules Inhibitors (SMI) that have the potential to potently and specifically inhibit multiple drug resistance (MDR) bacterial pathogens including tier-1 CDC/DoD listed bacterial.</p>
<p>The DoD is interested in exploring availability of SMIs that possess new mechanism of action(s) and are bactericidal against broad MDR bacterial infectious pathogens. DoD welcomes engagement of all sources that have reached at an advanced Phase I clinical studies or completed this clinical Phase.</p>
<p>Interested parties should fully describe their technology and provide all available information with respect to criteria listed below. Responders can be from the commercial sector, academia, the United States Government, and international entities.</p>
<p>General Guidelines: The SMIs of interest need to have supporting information for a unique, novel mechanism of action that does not substantially overlap with marketed anti-bacterial pathogens for which multiple drug resistance (MDR) strains have been identified. The compound of interest should have commenced Phase I clinical studies for safety, tolerability, and PK, and advanced through Single Ascending Dosing (SAD) regimens with promising data that support utility against civilian infectious diseases (including MDR pathogens below. Data supporting safety and tolerability of compound administered via systemic or oral routes for at least 10 consecutive days are of special interest to the DoD. In this latter respect, it is an advantage for the compound to be delivered as a single dose or twice a day dosing regimen in either the oral or systemic (intravenous) injections. <br />It is also assumed that the compound(s) of interest have completed 3 month Toxicokinetic studies in 2 species for the duration of 1-3 months with acceptable profile supporting the IND filing. Furthermore, it is expected that no major issues regarding CMC, acceptable shelf life, and formulation needed to support viable civilian indication have been identified.</p>
<p>Specific requirements:<br />A. DTRA CB/JSTO will screen against threat bacterial pathogens will seek in vitro screen of the company compound to establish MIC50/90 sets of the strains of interest. <br />B. DTRA CB/JSTO will seek small animal proof of concept (POC) studies using animal models where &lsquo;natural disease' profile acceptable to the FDA has been established. Where needed, complementary PK studies and modeling will be performed. <br />C. DTRA CB/JSTO will seek single efficacy study for treatment efficacy as per FDA guidance.<br />D. DTRA CB/JSTO will seek "animal rule" studies as guided by the FDA for respective threat pathogens.<br />E. DTRA CB/JSTO will require company to submit data generated in "animal rule" studies as sIND and eventually sNDA along with NDA submission for civilian indications.<br />F. DTRA CB/JSTO will seek the establishing of joint teams working in collaboration towards accelerated development path in tandem with all regulatory requirements. <br />G.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Fedbid is a mechanism used by this office to solicit for common use commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil. Packages sent Federal Express or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527. The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp. If internet access is not available, contact the HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest procedures. <BR> <BR>See attached applicable clauses <BR> <BR>In responding to this request for quote, you must provide the manufacturer's name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications), the information describing what you are offering must be physically written into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum, respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested, your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number).

<DESC>The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is a mission critical, Safety of Life (SoL) navigation system within the FAA's National Airspace System (NAS).  WAAS provides LNAV, LNAV/VNAV, LPV, and LPV-200 levels of navigation services.  The WAAS currently uses Global Positioning System (GPS) L1 C/A and L2 P(Y) semi-codeless signals.  The United States Government Federal Register Notice (FRN) that DoD support of GPS L2 codeless/semi-codeless capability will likely end in 2020.

The FAA intends to replace the use of L2 P(Y) semi-codeless with the use of the GPS L5 civil signal under WAAS Phase IV - Dual Frequency Operations.  In addition to a new dual frequency SBAS navigation service, WAAS will continue to support legacy single frequency user services. 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) Dual Frequency Operations (DFO) will utilize Department of Defense Global Positioning System (GPS) L1 Coarse Acquisition and L5 signals to maintain existing Single Frequency User and provide a new Dual Frequency User Service.  The realization of an L5 capable GPS constellation has been delayed and therefore WAAS DFO has been segmented into two implementation phases.  DFO Segment 1 upgrades the WAAS infrastructure to enable reception and collection of the L5 signal with the WAAS reference station network and implements system changes required to sustain the WAAS.

In addition to the SIR and attachments, potential Offerors will need information contained in the DFO Technical Data Package (TDP).  These materials are subject to Import/Export control and will be available only through a FAA KSN website.  For KSN access, send an email request to the CO and Maria.ctr.Florentino@faa.gov providing the following information:

Company Name
Requestors Name and Position/Title
Mailing Address
Phone Number
Company Email Address

All requests for TDP access will be vetted prior to the issuance of a KSN user ID and password.

<DESC>The following responses are provided to the vendor questions:<br />
<p>1.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>QUESTION:</strong></span> What type of batteries are inside the 2 buoys and who is responsible for removal?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></span> Only buoy station 42A56 has batteries inside it's hull.  It contains 420 Air-Alkaline batteries (Cegasa AS10-2, approximately 20 pounds each).  The contractor is responsible for the removal of the batteries.  The Government will check all buoy compartments for hazardous atmosphere (oxygen and explosive gases) and make the compartments safe to open and enter.  The MSDS is available for the these batteries and can be sent to the contractor if requested.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>REFERENCE:</strong></span> STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW), UNDER "BACKGROUND", 2ND PARAGRAPH.</p>
<p>2.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>QUESTION:</strong></span> What waters are the buoys located?  Do we need a special permit or preauthorization from Mexico before we can enter these waters?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></span> The 2 NOAA buoys are located off the coast of Mexico and are considered to be in international waters, but they are in an area called, "Exclusive Economic Zone".  The Contractor will be responsible for verifying the entry requirements with the Mexican authorities.</p>
<p>3.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>QUESTION:</strong></span> How much do the buoys weigh?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></span> Each buoys weighs approximately 192,900 lbs of which 45 percent is water ballast.</p>
<p><strong>REFERENCE:&nbsp;</strong> STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW), UNDER "BUOY DESCRIPTION", 1ST PARAGRAPH.</p>
<p><br />4.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>QUESTION:</strong></span> How is the mooring to be removed?</p>
<p>RESPONSE:  The contractor is responsible for disconnecting the buoys from the mooring.  The technical approach to perform this task is the Contractor's decision.  As part of the Government's technical evaluation, we will evaluate each contractor's technical approach.  Refer to Appendix 1 and 2 of the SOW which shows the mooring design.</p>

<DESC>The following responses are provided to the vendor questions:<br /><br /><strong>5.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> QUESTION:</span></strong> How is it verified that the 1-1/2" Chain (38') is definitely on the deck of the buoy for disconnection to the mooring?<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br />RESPONSE:</strong></span> The last time we visited the buoys (42A55 in 2012 and 42A56 in 2013), the retrieval pendant was still attached and the 38 ft chain still faked out on deck.  However, due to the age of the buoy, the Government cannot guarantee that these retrieval chains are still present and still usable. Please refer to the mooring diagrams on the Statement of Work (SOW), Appendix 1 &amp; 2.  The Contractor will be responsible for disconnecting the buoy from the mooring.  Refer to the SOW, under "Requirements", 1st paragraph.<br /><br /><strong>6.&nbsp;</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> QUESTION:</strong></span> Is the mooring system simply being left on the seafloor?<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>RESPONSE:</strong></span> The mooring system can be left on the sea floor.  Leaving a small section of chain attached to the nylon after cutting the buoy free will weigh the nylon down and drag it below any ship or submersible traffic.  Or the contractor has the option to retrieve the mooring and bring back to shore.  But if retrieved, the Government will not take possession of the mooring.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br /></strong></span><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> QUESTION:</strong></span> Is it preferable that the buoys come back to US port or doesn't it matter?<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>RESPONSE: </strong></span> It does not matter what country the buoys are brought to.  However, the vendor's technical proposal must give reasonable assurance that the buoy will be brought ashore, rendered incapable of going adrift at sea again, and disposed of according to local laws and regulations.<br /><br /><strong>THE RESPONSE DATE FOR THIS NOTICE REMAINS UNCHANGED, <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MARCH 4, 2014 (5:00 PM - EASTERN STANDARD TIME)</span></em></strong><br />

<DESC>The purpose of pre-solicitation notice modification 1 is as follows:
1. To correct the NAICS code title to (Environmental Consulting Services). 2. The applicable NAICS remains unchanged as 541620 (Environmental Consulting Services) with a size standard of $14 Million.  

Pre-Solicitation Notice Technology Transfer Support SOL-CI-13-00041
The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) National Center for Environmental Research (NCER) has a requirement to provide support for developing and disseminating information on effective environmental technologies; developing sound information to support regulations and policy decisions; and providing technical information transfer and meeting support. This includes the support needed to create, compile, synthesize and disseminate key technical information products and research applications. The four key areas of support are as follows: (1) Dissemination of Information, (2) Preparation of Technical Publications, (3) Preparation of Electronic Products, and (4) Logistical and Technical Support for the Conduct of Meetings. The successful contractor shall supply all necessary labor, material, services, equipment, and facilities in support of the effort delineated by the performance work statement.  
The standard EPAAR solicitation provisions (EPAAR 1552.209-70 and 1552.209-72) require and offeror certify that it is unaware of any potential conflict of interest or disclose any potential conflict of interest which may impact their ability to impartially conduct work under the solicitation.  
The standard EPAAR solicitation provision (EPAAR 1552.209-71) requiring a contractor to make full disclosure of any actual or potential conflict of interest discovered after contract award will also be a part of the resultant solicitation.  
The Government anticipates awarding the new contract as an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract with firm fixed price and cost plus fixed fee task orders over a five year ordering period. The EPA intends to award a single contract using a small business set-aside.  The anticipated minimum amount is $100,000 and the anticipated maximum is $30,000,000.  The applicable NAICS code is 541620 (Research & Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences) with a size standard of $14 Million.  

The solicitation is expected to be issued in on February 28, 2014 on EPA's website: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd. The office does not intend to mail hard copies of the solicitation.  It is the responsibility of the offerors to frequently check the EPA website for updates or changes.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which may be considered by the agency.  The point of contact is Michael Kreacic at 513-487-2104, at Kreacic.michael@epa.gov.

ACASS is the primary source of information on past performance (DFARS 236.602-1(a)(4)) that the evaluation board will consider.  ACASS / PPIRS may be queried for all prime / JV and key subcontractors.  The firm should also demonstrate the ability to comply with the proposed design cost and a history of designing projects to pre-defined construction cost limitations. Any credible, documented information on relevant past performance can be considered.  <br>  The submitting A-E contractor shall provide a reference using the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (Attachment 1) and/or a final ACASS report for each example project submitted by the A-E contractor under the Specialized Corporate Experience and Technical Competence.  The submitting A-E contractor is responsible for forwarding the PPQ to each past performance reference submitted under this synopsis.  The submitting A-E contractor should complete Blocks 1-4 of the PPQ and the client/customer complete Blocks 5-8 and the evaluation survey.  The client/customer should return the PPQ to the firm to be submitted with the SF330.   Each PPQ will be evaluated to determine if it is relevant to the design of facility repairs, renovations, conversions, or rehabilitations of similar size, scope and magnitude to the services being procured under this synopsis and design complete within the last five (5) years from the date of this synopsis, and if so, the quality of the A-E contractor's past performance will be assessed. In the event that adverse past performance information is obtained outside the PPIRS/ACASS, the firm will have the opportunity to respond to any adverse information received which it had not had a previous opportunity to comment if the vendor is in the slate of firms selected for discussions IAW FAR 36.602-3(c) or if adverse past performance is the determining reason why the firm is not in the slate of the most highly qualified firms.  If the A-E contractor's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can reasonably be assigned, or if sufficient past performance data cannot be obtained from the questionnaires, PPIRS, other sources or the firm has no past performance record, the firm in either instance will be given an  quote mark Unknown Risk quote mark  or  quote mark Neutral quote mark  rating.  <br>    <br>  3.4 Capacity Criteria (d): Firms competing shall demonstrate an effective organizational structure and quality management plan to accomplish multiple individual task orders simultaneously in a one year period of time with values ranging from $100,000 to $1,000,000 each.

The USAMMDA and USAMMA direct, control, manage, and focus the development of medical materiel systems to meet Service-unique and joint Service performance, schedule, and cost requirements.           <br>                  <br>       The USAMMDA and USAMMA Project Managers develop and field medical products for the US Armed Forces in conjunction with the Army Medical Department Center and School (the combat developer) and other service inputs (external partners).  Project Manager assigns product development to individual product managers and the product managers (PdMs), with support from the Division of Regulated Activities and Compliance (DRAC) and Clinical Support Services Division (CSSD), take promising new concepts and technologies developed in the USAMRMC laboratories and in the academic and commercial sectors, manage the development and testing of prototypes of these products (as necessary), and manage the products through the development lifecycle, ultimately to achieve US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, licensure and /or clearance, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registration, and/or approval of the developed product, to include post marketing commitments, for use by our Service Members through the requirements defined in the DoD and Army acquisitions processes (DoD 5000 series).  Thus, the USAMMDA and USAMMA product managers are responsible for the success (including cost/schedule/ performance) of the product development effort and must manage Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) through the development and implementation of development plans (and other acquisition requirements, as applicable), to develop and field medical materiel.  The USAMMDA and USAMMA accomplish their respective missions by exercising four core capabilities:  (1) Defense Acquisition and Program Management; (2) Regulatory Affairs (FDA or EPA regulated products); (3) Medical Product Development; and, (4) Coordination of The Surgeon General's Executive Agent management of Force Health Protection's IND products.         <br>                  <br>       Depending on the product development strategy, the Office of the Surgeon General (OTSG), Department of the Army, may be the regulatory sponsor.  For these product development efforts, DRAC and CSSD are the regulatory elements responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable regulations.  In these cases, DRAC and CSSD may execute FDA regulated sponsor responsibilities or delegate some or all of these responsibilities to the Prime or its subcontractor and only provide oversight of these activities. In other cases, the product development effort will include industry or academia partners who hold the regulatory Sponsorship, which may also include foreign government marketing strategies.  The DRAC and CSSD may provide oversight of regulated activities sponsored by partners, depending on the capabilities or requests of the partner.  Specific requirements will be variable and included in detail at the task order level.         <br>                  <br>       Additionally, DRAC and CSSD provide regulatory affairs and medical product development support for other organizations outside of USAMMDA and USAMMA, including USAMRMC subordinate commands, and the Chemical and Biological Defense Program.  These organizations may utilize this contract vehicle to conduct product development activities, which are being sponsored by OTSG and supported by USAMMDA DRAC and CSSD.         <br>                  <br>       The CBMS Joint Project Management Office is responsible for research, development, acquisition, fielding, and life cycle management of FDA-approved medical systems for protection, treatment, and diagnostic capabilities against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat agents.  All CBRN medical countermeasures are approved by and regulated through the FDA.  The CBMS continues to aggressively explore opportunities to partner with other government agencies, industry, academia, and allied countries for all CBRN medical countermeasure efforts.  The CBMS product portfolio includes products spanning the entire acquisition life cycle.           <br>                <br>       Objective:         <br>                  <br>       The objective of this requirement is to facilitate the timely and efficient execution of the US Army's medical materiel development program by providing a mechanism for all aspects of medical product/device development and life cycle support, including project management, technical expertise/assistance, strategic planning, market analysis, training, administrative activities, and pharmaceutical manufacturing and testing, assay validation, validated storage and shipment, non-clinical testing, clinical research (to include monitoring, safety pharmacovigilance and surveillance, full data management, and biostatistical support), regulatory writing and submission support, regulatory strategy and consultation, quality, integrated logistics support, equipment maintenance support and information technology in support of each task order.  For example:  a task order may specify that a contractor will conduct clinical trials worldwide (inclusive of pre-trial activities, trial activities and post trial activities),  provide product managers with support services to assist/provide technical guidance and provide independent and objective reviews, site feasibility assessments, prepare and assemble both generic and product-specific US FDA and EPA related documentation, take meeting minutes, provide complete clinical monitoring support including compilation of Sponsor trial master files, provide a data management system , preferably an electronic data capture (EDC) system, compliant with FDA/ICH regulations and guidance, data management, biostatistical evaluation and data analysis, safety pharmacovigilance and surveillance, and complete a final clinical study report compliant with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and/or FDA regulations and guidance.          <br>                  <br>       Period of Performance:          <br>                  <br>       The Period of Performance for this contract will be a five year base period with five one-year option periods.          <br>                  <br>       Response:          <br>                  <br>       This notice is for informational purposes only.  No response is required for this presolicitation notice.  Telephone requests in response to this presolicitation notice will not be honored.  Additional information is not available at this time.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) Scott Field Office has issued modification P00056 to contract HC1013-04-C-5003 for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/National Communications System (NCS). The current contract is a limited sole source award to Sprint Communications Company, LP, a GETS Interexchange Carrier (IXC), for a Firm Fixed Price contract. A justification for other than full and open competition that supports this action is attached. <br />The purpose of this J&amp;A is to afford the NCS the opportunity extend Next Generation Network (NGN) GETS/priority service to users accessing the network via Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) originating calls. Continued contractual support for GETS and GETS NGN is essential to provide specially-designed telecommunications services for the National Security and Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) user community during natural or man-made disasters, when conventional communications services are ineffective. Specifically, GETS and NGN GETS help to coordinate response and recovery efforts, and in severe conditions, assist with Continuity of Operations (COOP) and Continuity of Government (COG). <br />

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO 21; 2615 E. Clinton Avenue, Fresno, CA 93703.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  Justification and approval for Other than Full and Open Competition for content development services for mobile applications to be used by Veterans and Civilians who have experienced trauma and/or have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).   Work is located at the National Center for PTSD, VA Palo Alto Medical Center, 3801 Miranda Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94304.  

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:    The Contractor shall provide content development services for mobile applications for mental health. The current project aims to create and support a suite of clinical software applications for mobile phones that can be used by Veterans and civilians who have experienced trauma and/or have PTSD. The contractor will be responsible for creation of original content for these applications, design of same, creation of basic technical specification documents, communication with VA stakeholders, iterative testing process, and creation of supporting materials used to disseminate the resulting applications.

4.	  The total estimated amount of service Base Plus 1 Option Year $120,000.   NAICS 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services, Size Standard $25.5 Million   

4.    Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source (41 USC 253 (c) (1)).

5.    Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   The National Center for PTSD, VA Palo Alto Health Care Facility has multiple years of past experience working with Dr. Laura Wald.  Dr. Wald has been a DoD contractor developing web apps and mobile apps for years.  Since VA has posted only 6 mobile applications to iTunes in the past 3 years, all of which came from either Dr. Wald or the VA Palo Alto National Center for PTSD Team, VA is certain no other individual and/or firm has the experience level required of the rigorous and idiosyncratic certification process for mobile applications. VA requires a single content expert with both expertise in mental health (diagnosis, research methods, treatment) and mobile delivery of tools (including the software development process). Finding a new firm or individual is not only highly unlikely, but would result in increased cost and untimely performance. Market research results yield no psychologists or psychiatrists with the qualifications required for this scope of service. Multiple individuals have been given opportunities to meet this requirement in the past only to be removed from the position for failure to perform because such a specific skill set is required.  There is no other vendor or individual that can successfully perform this service based on the scope of work and requirements.

6.    Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:    Notice of intent to sole source with description of requirement shall be posted to FedBizOps www.fbo.gov, the official Government Point of Entry.    

7.    Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  Service has been performed by Dr. Wald in recent years and pricing remains consistent even with regards to inflation.  An Independent Government Estimate (IGE) was established based on historical data and pricing is deemed fair and reasonable as compared to the IGE. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Notice of intent to sole source with description of requirement shall be posted to FedBizOps www.fbo.gov.  

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:   None.  

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  No actions will be taken to overcome barriers to competition.  Other firms and individuals claimed to have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform this service and each have failed, which has resulted in time and money lost.  It would require significant financial resources, time, and personnel to reach the current level achieved by Dr. Wald and the National Center for PTSD, VA Palo Alto HealthCare Facility.  There is no other vendor that can successfully perform this service based on the scope of work and requirements.  

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  



Approvals in accordance with FAR 6.304 

a.	Contracting Officer's Certification: (required) I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
