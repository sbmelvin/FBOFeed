<DESC>7610 - SUBSCRIPTION - U.S. Dept. of Commerce/ITA intends to procure on a sole source basis the services of USA Recovery/Monitor to measure the travel behavior and traveler attitudes from D.K. Shiffet & Associates, Ltd.,7115 Leesburg Pike, Suite 300, Falls Church, Virginia 22043. The USA/Recovery/Monitor will focus on relatively frequent business and leisure travelers, and includes anticipated travel components with additional attitudinal/sentiment measures. This enhancement establishes an ongoing measuring system that allows for fast turn around information on expected travel, utilizing a projectable sample with historic comparisons among travelers who account for most of the country's travel expenditures. This enhance study yields psychological pattern information tied to behavior change data, with clear subgroup analyses.  A benchmark study is required along with Towline updates, intermediate report updates and full report updates.  Additionally, specifically relevant attitudinal measures such as "confidence" and behavior-change metrics are supplemented to reflect psychological segments with their "acted-upon attitudes" and changing spending patterns. Following a benchmark initial wave with psychological/motivational segmentation, measurement will initially be weekly with top-line results, plus in-depth monthly analysis.  Monthly breakdowns will include industry totals, sector detail (airlines, hotels by segment, etc),  travel purpose specificity (business vs. leisure), and traveler profiling including frequent business and leisure travelers.  Traveler segmentation will support communications focus and message/style refinement. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a request for quotation.  Submit offers to RFQ #0236.  This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2001-07.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the procurement is 334516 and the small business size standard is 500.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases requires a magnetic cell separation system that provides for the isolation of specific sub-populations of cells, bacteria, organelles, or virus from larger heterogeneous populations, both by positive and negative selection, in a way that preserves the function and viability of the cells or biomaterial.  The sorted material should allow for further culture and/or PCR and FACS analyses.  The system should also allow for rapid, large-scale isolation of cells, in the range of 108 to 109, or for isolation of very rare populations present within the heterogenous mix.  The system should provide automation of sorting and make use of monoclonal antibodies to various specific cell surface molecules in order to allow cells to be sorted.  The system should take advantage of separating cells by virtue of the fact that monoclonal antibodies to specific surface structures can be attached to magnetic, biodegradable microbeads (in the range of 50 nm), which can then be selected, negatively or positively, with strong magnets that will retain the beads as materials flow through a column.  The microbeads should be coated with polysaccharide, conjugated to monoclonal antibodies or other biodetectors.  Separation time should be on the order of 3-10 minutes to minimally affect cells or other biomaterials, separations should be effective to near 98% and columns should be reusable for more than 50 times during a 1-2 week period. Isolation should be automated and regulatable via preprogrammed protocols and volumes to be run should be widely variable, from less than 250 microliters to more than 25 millimeters.  Delivery location is National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; Bethesda, MD 20892 and shall be inside delivery.    FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition are FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors ? Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications ? Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contractor Terms and Conditions ? Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders ? Commercial Items.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Test, Measurement, Diagnostic and Equipment (TMDE) has a requirement to upgrade all previously fielded SPORT-ICE Kits with DPA configuration, estimated quantity of 1500 ICE Kits.  Solce Source to Miltope Corporation, 500 Richardson Rd., Hope Hull, AL 36043.  Miltope Corporation under both the SPORT and MSD contracts manufacture the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) kits that accompany the SPORT and MSD.  These kits contain accessory components required to test and diagnose the TACOM ICE vehicle  systems.   After the initial fielding of the ICE kits, several Army trucks identified new data bus test hardware requirements to Program Manager TMDE.  Because Army mechanics are multisystem capable (can work on any truck that may be turned in for repair)  their test equipment must also have the capability to work on all vehicles.  An engineering change was completed and incorporated into the SPORT, and into the MSD contract to accommodate the ICE Kit modifications (3 cables added and DPA enhanced to Haldex ).   This effort must be undertaken to upgrade all previously fielded SPORT-ICE Kits with the new Dearborn Protocol Adapter configuration.  Miltope Corporation maintains the Army's SPORT and MSD warranty data base as part of the Miltope Technical Assistanc e Hotline to the Army users.  Miltope will, as a part of this effort, also update the existing warranty data base and technical assistance to include the retrofit units.  Every SPORT-ICE comes with a 5-year OEM warranty.  If damages to the fielded SPORT-IC E kits result from this effort, the 5-year OEM warranty will be negated.  Miltope is the prime integrator of accessory hardware into the ICE Kit which has been fielded with the SPORT.  See note (22)

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to enter into a sole source contract entitled, Technical Development of Loss-of-Coolant Accident (LOCA) Frequency Distributions, with Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI) Columbus Operations to provide technical support to the NRC staff as they develop a regulatory guide on Leak-Before-Break (LBB) evaluation procedures. The proposed Regulatory Guide will be based on previous research, industry applications and prior rulemaking.  BMI will also provide technical support for risk-informing 10 CFR 50.46 and aid in the development of revised SBLOCA, MBLOCA and LBLOCA frequency estimates. The period of performance for this project is approximately 3 years. This proposed contract is a follow-on effort to contract NRC-04-98-039 entitled Technical Support for Regulatory Guide on LBB Evaluation Procedures. The NRC believes that BMI is the only known source capable of performing this effort in the required time frame. BMI has personnel with the unique experience and expertise necessary for developing physical models, realized through computer simulation, to provide the NRC with an analytical and predictive understanding of fracture mechanics and multiple degradation mechanisms for piping systems in commercial light-water reactor nuclear power plants.  Additionally, award to another firm would seriously affect the ability of the NRC to meet milestones in several critical research efforts.  SECY-02-0057 on risk-informing 10 CFR 50.46 requires that rulemaking related to LOCA-LOOP revision be finalized in the summer of 2003.  The LOCA redefinition effort will provide LOCA frequencies to support this effort.  The SECY paper also requires that the spectrum of break sizes be completed by June 2004.  Follow-on technical work to support potential rulemaking arising from the redefinition of pipe break sizes must be completed by June 2005.  BMI has been providing assistance to the NRC in this area since 1998. NRC believes this familiarity is critical in order to meet the milestone dates established by the Commission.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Alberto Tozzi, Laboratorio di Epidemiologia e Biostatistica Instituto Superoire di Sanita, located in Viale Regina Elena, Rome; a contract to compare prevalence rates of neurodevelopmental disorders among DtaP vaccine trial particiapants exposed to varying quantities of thimersol (an organic mecury compound used as a preservative)during infancy in randomized, controlled trials of acellular pertussis vaccines. These services will include, but is not limited to the following two Phases (1) Develop and conduct a pilot study. Task 1, Determine the success rate of tracing children who belonged to the original cohort involved in the Italian trial of acellular pertussis vaccines. Task 2, Assess the participation rate for a follow-up study among the candidate families identified in Task 1. Task 3, Confirm the assumed prevalence figures for ADHD and speech or language delay disorders among Italain children (as used in the sample sized estimates presented above) in children who are identified for participation in the follow-up study. Task 4, Conduct objective neuropsychological testing in Italian children participating in the pilot study. This testing would begin with tracing and recruitment of 200 children (100 per vaccine group) to whom the tests would be administered.  A neuropsychological test battery similar to one being used by CDC in their follow-up study of HMO cohorts exposed to different levels of thimersol will be utilized in this study as well.  Italian specialists in neuropsychological testing will identify appropriate Italian tests if a specific test from the CDC battery is not available in Italian (or cannot be successfully translated into Italian for technical reasons). Phase (2), Develop and conduct a follow-up study among an entire regional cohort of children who participated in the acellular pertussis vaccine trial. Task 1, Identify and specifically train nurses who will be responsible for tracing and recruiting children into the follow-up study.  Additionally, it is suggested that the 20 nurses who worked on the original acellular pertussis vaccine trial in the Veneto region and who followed these children for cough illnesses in the Region be contacted and recruited as study nurses for this follow-up study. Task 2, The second phase of the study will require the recruitment of an entire regional cohort of children who participated in the vaccine trial in order to minimize selection bias. This phase of the study will seek to enroll a total of 1200 children (600 from each of the two vaccine arms)to meet the sample size estimates provided above. Task 3, Train a sufficient number of pediatric neurologists or neuropsychological technicians to standardized the administration of neuropsychological tests to 1200 children. Task 4, Administer neuropsychological tests to children participating in the follow-up study at local vaccination or pediatrics clinics. Task 5, Tabulate results of neuropsychological tests performed in a written report.  It is estimated that the second phase of this study would require an additional 18 months to complete. The Alberto Tozzi Laboratorio di Epidemilogia e Biostatistica Istituto Superiore di Sanita, is the only known institution in Viale Regina Elena Roma that can provide the necessary infrastructure to perform this project. The period of performance is twenty-four months.  It is anticipated that the contract will be awarded around September 27, 2002 with performance to begin September 29, 2002.  The scheduled solicitation issue date is approximately July 1, 2002.  The solicitation will also be posted at this website (http://www.eps.gov/) on or around July 1, 2002.  Any amendments issued to this solicitation will also be available at the same website.  Hardcopies of the solicitation and any amendments issued will not be mailed to the offerors.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code for this solicitation is 561110.  Notes 1 and 26*****

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to extend its Institutional Services (IS) contract on a sole source basis.  The IS contract furnishes the necessary management, personnel, equipment and materials (not otherwise provided by the Government) to provide institutional services at MSFC located in Huntsville, Alabama.  The work can be broken down into the following elements: Project Management, Transportation and Special Equipment Services, Supply and Equipment Management, Equipment Maintenance and Repair, Mail Service, and Food Service.  The current contract completion date is September 30, 2002, and the services defined above will be continued for up to six months (a three-month base period with three one-month options) through March 31, 2003.  NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the services defined above from Cortez III Service Corporation pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).  This extension will allow NASA/MSFC sufficient time to complete the follow-on recompetition for the IS contract (which is in process) and transition to the successor contract.  Safe, efficient operations, as well as timely support to users, are key factors in the work under the contract.  Given the duration of this extension, no other sources could be expected to take over for the period specified and be expected to perform at an acceptable level due to the training requirements and complexity of the functions involved in performing the job.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on the Response Date identified in this notice.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition    basis, based upon responses, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".  Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:     http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

<DESC>TITLE:  INTEGRATED ATMOSPHERIC CHEMICAL SENSORS PACKAGE
SOL:  AFBAA 02-01-45CONS/LGCCB Due: 31 July 02 (White Papers Only)
POC: Contracting Specialist Pat Colbary, (321) 494-8370, Bob Stuart Contracting Officer (321) 494-5189, Technical Advisor Mr. Tomas Corey (321) 494-7241.  Broad Agency Announcement?The 45th Contracting Squadron is soliciting firms for a design study to develop a prototype of an integrated atmospheric chemical sensors package using both current commercial and government technology. The following three issues are of importance for this sensor package: maintainability, portability, and sensitivity.  A) Maintainability: The integrated sensor package must survive harsh natural environments with unskilled operator intervention, and operate without routine maintenance or calibration for long periods of time (target is at least 6 months). The integrated sensor package shall be capable of stand-alone operation, and also interface with existing equipment (hardware interface specs to be determined later). The integrated sensor package shall include software to facilitate both hardware diagnostics and programmable activation schedules. B) Portability:  The integrated sensor package shall be packaged in cases (one case is desirable), each transportable by one individual. The integrated sensor package shall be deployable worldwide and be able to use local power supply. C) Sensitivity: The integrated sensor package must house sensors that measure and record (in Microsoft-compatible data format) levels of UV-B solar radiation and atmospheric pollutants to include at least NMHC, O3 and NOx. The thresholds for the above mentioned pollutants are as follows; NMHC 1.5 ppmC or lower, 03 0.5 ppm or lower, NOx 0.5 ppm or lower, and UV-B. It is desired that the integrated sensor package also detect and quantify pollutants including SOx (2 ppm or lower), CO (50 ppm or lower), particulates (>10 microns), asbestos fibers, and metals (Arsenic, Beryllium, Cadmium, Chromium, Cobalt, Lead, Manganese, Mercury, Nickel, Selenium, Silver, Vanadium, Zinc, Uranium isotopes, and depleted Uranium). Lower detection levels for the pollutants required are a plus.

Some aspects of the project will be classified; therefore, developer must maintain a SECRET level security clearance. Possession of a current SECRET clearance is a necessity for the entire project. Companies not possessing a clearance need not submit white papers. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and are advised to immediately contact the 45th Contracting Squadron for information if they contemplate responding. Because the program will span multiple disciplines and capabilities, teaming arrangements may be appropriate. Participation by historically black colleges and universities/minority institutions (HBCU/M1) are encouraged.

White Papers are sought from offerors who wish to propose innovative technology development in the area of atmospheric chemical sensors. This BAA is a competitive solicitation and this announcement constitutes a request for White Papers Only. The white paper shall propose an integrated sensor package concept that maximizes the use of commercial and government off-the-shelf components where cost effective, and where such use satisfies requirements. The white paper may include multiple design options, each with a different balance between maintainability, portability, and sensitivity. Prospective contractors should include names, dollar amounts, and customer contact information for similar projects. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal at a later date. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Evaluation of future proposals will be accomplished through a scientific peer review conducted during which the following evaluation criteria will be applied.  1) 50% Methodology for the research and design of the integrated sensor package. How does the potential contractor address each of the following aspects of the integrated sensor package in order of importance:
maintainability, portability, and sensitivity. 2) 30% Past performance of contracts that are similar to this concept in nature and scope. 3) 20% Potential schedule and costs for the design study. The primary basis for selecting proposals for acceptance shall be technical, importance to agency programs, and fund availability. Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate. This BAA is an expression of interest only ? the cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 3 1.205-18. All White Papers (original and one copy) must be submitted in hard copy to:  Mr. Thomas Corey
AFTAC/TMKE
1030 S. Hwy AlA
Patrick AFB, Fl 32925

Responses should reference this BAA number 02-01. The due date for submission of white papers is 2:00 PM EST, 31 July 2002. White Papers received after the exact time will be processed according to FAR 52.215-10, Late Submissions, Modifications and Withdrawals of Proposals. White Papers and proposals will not be returned after evaluation. Offerors are reminded that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. Offerors must mark their proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).

For the proposal phase, offerors are required to submit cost and technical proposals in an original and two paper copies and on a 3 ?? high density disk or a CD-ROM using Microsoft Word. Proposals submitted are to be effective for 180 days and shall state this in the cost proposal. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions.

This research initiative is envisioned as a staged approach leading to a viable atmospheric integrated sensor package. The initial contract will be for the design study, development and construction of one or more prototypes, and possible production of subject sensor package. Initial funding for the design study and prototype development is anticipated ranging from $300K to $500K. The Government reserves the right to select for award, all, some, or none of the proposals received. White papers and proposal submissions will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 3.104-4 and 3.104-5, applicable law, and DoD regulations.  Multiple awards may occur as a result of this BAA.

An ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered to be ?significant concerns:? and should be communicated directly to the Contracting Officer, Robert Stuart (321) 494-5189. The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Contracting Officer or Program Manager, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Ms. Susan Stone, Chief, Mission Support Flight, 45CONS/LGCZ (321) 494-5572. When requested the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of the proposals or in the source selection process.

This has been further defined by the Asset Forfeiture Law and Practice Manual as, Notice of the seizure of property and the intent to forfeit must be published once a week for three successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the judicial district in which the proceeding is brought. In addition, it has been determined this requirement can be met by publication in a national newspaper that meets certain circulation requirements. ATF is mandated by Congress to publish all administrative seizures in a newspaper of general circulation in all 92 judicial districts of the United States and its territories.  The advertisement must be published in a newspaper once a week for three consecutive weeks.  The purpose of these advertisements is to give notice to all interested parties such as a lien holder or other unknown individuals who may have a vested interest in the property. C.1 REQUIREMENTS: The contractor shall publish the legal advertisements in a newspaper of general circulation. That is, a newspaper that publishes news of general interest and character to the public, to include political and business events, circulating among the general public in each of the Federal judicial districts of the United States and its territories. The advertisement shall include at a minimum specific descriptive information regarding the property and its seizure by ATF. In addition the advertisement will include instructions as to how parties with an interest in the property seized can file a claim to contest the seizure and intended forfeiture of the property. The boundaries of the following Federal judicial districts correspond to the state or territorial boundaries. Therefore, circulation figures for these states or territories will demonstrate circulation for the judicial district.

It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to customize their software necessary to meet the government needs and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 27, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Cognitive Information Processing Technology, SOL BAA 02-21, Abstracts Due: April 4, 2003, Proposals Due: Friday, June 6, 2003 POC: Dr. Ronald J. Brachman and Mr. Zachary J. Lemnios, DARPA/IPTO; FAX: (703) 741-7804.  PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for research in the area of cognitive information processing technology.  DARPA's Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO) seeks proposals to perform innovative research and development on cognitive systems and technologies that offer significant advances in performance and other relevant metrics above and beyond extrapolations of current approaches.  Proposed research should investigate novel approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.  Cognitive systems have a number of differentiating characteristics, but in short, they can be characterized as systems that know what they are doing.  Such systems will have the ability to reason about their environment (including other systems), their goals, and their own capabilities; this reasoning will be able to take advantage of substantial amounts of appropriately represented knowledge.  Cognitive systems will be able to learn both from their experiences and by being taught.  They will be capable of natural interaction with humans, and will be able to explain their reasoning in natural terms.  They will be able to form teams that succeed at goals that cannot be achieved as individuals.  And, notably, they will be robust in the face of surprises provided by the environment; the avoidance of the "brittleness" of the expert systems of the past will be a distinguishing feature.  All technologies and approaches that enable the creation, demonstration and implementation of advanced cognitive information processing techniques are of potential interest under this BAA, including cross-disciplinary approaches that combine both innovative hardware and software to create unique computing technologies.  Applications of new cognitive information processing technology and systems are also of interest, in the form of stand-alone systems; mobile platforms; and deeply embedded, integrated components.  DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas: Computational Perception:  Technologies developed under this area of interest will serve as the information processing interface between sensors or other interfaces to the external environment and the underlying computational processes in a cognitive system.  Of interest are computational processes and embodiments that use a cognitive system's knowledge and experience to influence its perceptual capabilities in a way that provides revolutionary improvement in its abilities to detect important objects, events, and situations in its environment.  Representation and Reasoning: This area of interest seeks to create pragmatically adequate and mathematically well-founded knowledge representation formalisms and reasoning processes to support the entire range of cognitive information processing demands.  Approaches that allow a computational system to reflect on its own capabilities and performance and to use such reflection to improve performance and solve more difficult problems are of particular interest.  Learning: This area seeks to develop technologies for machines that learn that are sufficient for measurable improvements of basic functionality through the accumulation of experience.  Communications and Interaction Technology: This area seeks to develop technologies related to advanced interfaces between cognitive systems, legacy systems, and humans.  Of special interest are capabilities that allow cognitive systems to be instructed, guided, and persuaded using natural human-oriented communications (e.g., natural language, pictures, gestures).  Cognitive Architectures and Integrated Cognitive Agents: Systems that integrate the cognitive capabilities of reasoning, learning, explaining,ability to be advised, self awareness and robust coping with surprise are of interest, especially such systems that exhibit capabilities substantially beyond those achievable with conventional technology.  Significant contributions to the understanding of system architectures adequate to produce functional artificial cognitive systems are also of interest.  Robust Software and Hardware: This area seeks to develop novel structures and architectures for software and hardware platforms that facilitate the building and operation of robust, secure cognitive systems.  New technology for innovative fault-tolerant and secure software and hardware infrastructure in the context of cognitive systems and teams of such systems is of interest.  Cognitive Teams: This area seeks innovative ideas for creating and managing multi-agent systems that can achieve goals in a coordinated way.  Such systems can include multiple artificial cognitive agents, humans, and non-cognitive components.  Technology that facilitates successful performance of ad hoc teams or networks is of interest.  Underlying Foundations: This area seeks to establish fundamental scientific and mathematical foundations for cognitive computing areas for which none exist or where those that do are inadequate.  Areas of direct interest include, but are not limited to, the following: innovative ideas, concepts, and approaches to determine the most effective machine, information system, and network architectures for cognitive computing for different tasks and contexts; technologies inspired by biological systems that might provide cognitive systems with a more appropriate computing basis than conventional von Neumann platforms; scientific and technical advances in the understanding and implementation of trust relationships among autonomous cognitive systems.  Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Special Areas of Interest section of the BAA Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.  PROGRAM SCOPE: Multiple awards are anticipated.  Offerors submitting an abstract should include an estimate of costs based on the anticipated level of effort and associated costs to accomplish the work described.  Abstracts and proposals will be reviewed as received and funding decisions made following each review.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state of the art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposed research should contribute substantially towards the goals stated and include interim and final measurable milestones.  Where relevant, research should result in prototype software and/or hardware demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in incremental improvement to the existing state of practice.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.  Proposals may involve multiple research groups or industrial cooperation.  GENERAL INFORMATION: This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) strongly advocates submission of an abstract prior to submission of a full proposal.  Furthermore, responses require completion of a BAA Cover Sheet for each Abstract/Proposal prior to submission.  This cover sheet can be accessing at the following URL: http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=02-21.  After finalizing the BAA Cover Sheet, the proposer must print the BAA Confirmation Sheet that will automatically appear on the web page.  Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to every copy.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of the Abstract/Proposal.  If a proposer intends on submitting more than one Abstract/Proposal, a unique UserId and password should be used in creating each BAA Cover Sheet.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.  NEW REQUIREMENTS/PROCEDURES: The Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of DARPA/IPTO Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report.  These reports will be submitted electronically via the DARPA/IPTO Technical-Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government-furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW).  Further details may be found in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).  ABSTRACT FORMAT: In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts, in accordance with the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), in advance of full proposals.  Proposers must submit original and 4 hard copies of the abstract and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the proposal abstract (in PDF or Microsoft Word 2000 for IBM-compatible format on a 3.5-inch floppy disk or one 100 MB Iomega Zip disk).  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 02-21, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and "Copy (Number) of 2".  The abstract (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/IPTO, ATTN: BAA 02-21, 3701 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714, in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 NOON (EDT) Friday, April 4, 2003.  PROPOSAL FORMAT: Proposers must submit an original and 4 copies of the full proposal and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal (in PDF or Microsoft Word 2000 for IBM-compatible format on a 3.5-inch floppy disk or one 100 MB Iomega Zip disk).  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 02-21, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and "Copy (Number) of 2".  BAA 02-21, Cognitive Information Processing Technology will remain open until 12:00 NOON (EDT) Friday, June 6, 2003.  Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through Friday, June 6, 2003.  Proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding is reduced as fiscal year ceilings are reached.  Proposers must obtain the BAA 02-21 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, proposal abstracts, and full proposal formats.  This pamphlet will be posted directly to FedBizOpps.gov and may also be obtained by fax, electronic mail, mail request to the administrative contact address given below, or at URL address http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/Solicitations/index.html.  Abstracts and proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 02-21 PIP and all references, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a scientific review of each proposal, using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit: The overall scientific and technical merit must be clearly identifiable and compelling. The technical concept should be clearly defined, developed and defensibly innovative. Emphasis should be placed on the technical excellence of the development and experimentation approach.  (2) Innovative Technical Solution to the Problem:  Proposed efforts should apply new or existing technology in an innovative way such as is advantageous to the objectives.  The plan on how the offeror intends to get developed technology artifacts and information to the user community should be considered.  The offeror shall specify quantitative experimental methods and metrics by which the proposed technical effort's progress shall be measured.  (3) Potential Contribution and Relevance to DARPA/IPTO Mission: The offeror must clearly address how the proposed effort will meet the goals of the undertaking and how the proposed effort contributes to significant advances to the DARPA/IPTO mission.  (4) Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience: The qualifications, capabilities, and demonstrated achievements of the proposed principals and other key personnel for the primary and subcontractor organizations must be clearly shown.  (5) Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition: The offeror should provide a clear explanation of how the technologies to be developed will be transitioned to capabilities for military forces.  Technology transition should be a major consideration in the design of experiments, particularly considering the potential for involving potential transition organizations in the experimentation process.  (6) Cost Realism: The overall estimated cost to accomplish the effort should be clearly shown as well as the substantiation of the costs for the technical complexity described.  Evaluation will consider the value to Government of the research and the extent to which the proposed management plan will effectively allocate resources to achieve the capabilities proposed.  Cost is considered a substantial evaluation criterion but secondary to technical excellence.  All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or proposal to this BAA, must be received at one of the administrative addresses below by 12:00 NOON (EST) Friday, May 30, 2003; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for some of the correspondence regarding BAA 02-21.  Proposals and proposal abstracts MUST NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled, for administrative purposes only, by a support contractor.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items as prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  The  Solicitation Notice is No. AB1330-02-RP-0084R.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 97-25.   The Auke Bay Laboratory (ABL), one of four divisions of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), was first occupied December 5, 1960.  The facility is located on the main road, approximately 12 miles north of downtown Juneau, in southeast Alaska.  It is on the eastern shore of Auke Bay, which supports a rich marine environment.  The ABL workforce consists of 70 permanent employees and 15-25 contractors and non-NOAA personnel; the annual operating budget is nearly $10 million.  Present research involves six programs plus ABL administrative management.  Statement of Problem: During the course of previous asbestos surveys and interim abatement projects, asbestos containing materials (ACM) in the buildings of the Auke Bay Laboratory have been identified.  Recent renovation work in the genetics laboratory and the former dark room also identified potentially friable ACM on the pipe joints in the interstitial spaces above the laboratory.  This source of ACM had not been identified during previous assessments.  ACM associated with certain floor tiles, cove base and mastic had been identified during previous assessments,  approximately 4,400 square feet of floor tiles and approximately 60 pipe joints in the Main building and the Butler building. The condition of the floor tiles and mastic within the laboratory buildings has deteriorated over time.  A new project to update the survey, update air monitoring results, establish abatement priorities and monitor the abatement process is required.    A copy of the previous survey is available upon request.   Description of Work: The work will consist of a formal survey, analysis and testing to determine the location and condition of ACM.  This survey will update the previous survey completed in September, 1995.   The contractor shall perform a comprehensive asbestos survey of the Main and Butler buildings of the Auke Bay Laboratory to verify the location and condition of the known ACM within the buildings and to identify any unknown ACM.  Previous survey results and the results of previous abatement projects shall be made available to the contractor prior to commencing work.  Results from the new survey will be used to establish priorities for continuing abatement of ACM from the buildings.  Priorities for removal of the ACM from specific work areas shall be established by the AFSC Safety and Environmental Compliance Officer and the ABL Director, in coordination with the contractor.   The contractor shall also help design an abatement work plan that is safe, effective and minimizes the disruption and dislocation to laboratory personnel.  The contractor shall investigate the condition of the plumbing pipe insulation and floor tiles to determine the best course of action for safe removal or encapsulation.  This investigation shall include accurately diagraming the location of affected pipe joints, analytical testing of potential ACM and preparation of a work plan for the safe and appropriate abatement techniques to be used by the abatement contractor.  It is estimated that approximately 20 samples will be required for laboratory analysis, from an accredited laboratory.  The contractor shall also coordinate with the abatement contractor to ensure that all asbestos work is performed in a safe, efficient and compliant manner.  Class I, Class II, Class III and Class IV asbestos work, if any, shall only be performed by employees of the contractor trained and certified in accordance with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR 1926.1101).  The contractor shall provide NOAA copies of its employees current training certifications prior to commencing work.  If required, the contractor shall provide all required personnel protective equipment to its employees.  Employees who are required to work in "regulated areas" must also be provided with clean rooms, shower rooms and other facilities as required by the OSHA standards.  The methods of work shall be so designed as to prevent any contractor or government employee's exposure in excess of 0.1 fibers per cubic centimeter of Air Monitoring:  The contractor shall provide all labor and materials to monitor asbestos fibers in the buildings air prior to the start of any ACM abatement work.  The contractor shall be available on an hourly basis for consultation services periodically during the course of the abatement work and upon completion of abatement work.  The contractor shall assume sole and complete responsibility for the entire job site during the course of its work, including the safety of all persons and property.  A report of the complete monitoring results shall be turned over to the Auke Bay Laboratory Director.  Period of Performance:  Due to the ongoing safety and environmental concerns caused be the presence of deteriorating asbestos containing materials in the workplace, time is of the essence in completing the project.  In addition, the construction season in Alaska is limited due to severe winter weather conditions.  Therefore, the Contractor shall be required to a.) Commence work under the contract within 7 calendar days after the Contractor receives the notice to proceed, b.) Prosecute the work diligently, and c.) Complete the entire work plan, ready for use, not later than thirty days after receipt of the notice to proceed.  Deliverables:  Upon completion of the project, the contractor shall provide to the Auke Bay Laboratory Director, in electronic format: (1) A comprehensive report of the tasks performed, (2) The contractor's prioritized recommendations for abatement activities, (3) All analytical test results, (4) Annotated drawings showing the location and condition of ACM in the Main building and the Butler building. (5) All air monitoring test results, and (6) A recommended work plan for conducting the abatement activities.  Technical evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance with Factors B and C  being equal.   Factor A:  Demonstrate successful past performance experience on similar asbestos surveys and consultation projects.  Factor B:  Demonstrate familiarity with Federal, State of Alaska and local Juneau compliance requirements for asbestos survey and abatement projects.  Knowledge of local regulations and limitations for proper disposal of asbestos contain materials.  Factor C:  Demonstrate proper level of certification, qualifications, education and training necessary to satisfactorily complete the assigned scope of work and include identification of laboratory to perform analysis of ACM samples.  Factor D:  Demonstrate successful experience while working with, and coordinating with, qualified asbestos abatement contractors.  The proposal shall be prepared in accordance with FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offers - Commercial Items, and the offer shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items.  FAR clause 52.212.4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and there are no addenda to this provision.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Synaptic Function Unit (SFU) plans to procure an LSM 510 confocal Laser Scanning Microscope system with Axiovert 200 from Carl Zeiss Inc., One Zeiss Drive, Thornwood, NY 10594. The laser scanning microscope (LSM) will be used to collect optical sections of fluorescent specimens including visualizing immunofluorescence in tissue culture cells and brain slices, capturing time lapse movies of cells expressing proteins tagged with various fluorescent markers,  and monitoring cell physiology with fluorescent indicator dyes.  The research goal of the SFU is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying neurotransmitter release and its modulation.  This confocal microscope will be used in projects to: 1) determine the synaptic localization of several proteins in cultured hippocampal neurons; 2) determine protein-protein interaction in vivo  using FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer); 3) evaluate synaptic vesicle recycling by FM dye loading and unloading in live hippocampal neurons; and 4) observe vesicle movement along cytoskeletal structures of neuronal processes.  Since the SFU is a multi-user environment they require a system that is easy to operate and provides reliable quantitative data.  This microscope provides the following features: 1) each detector is equipped with its own pinhole for the possibility of simultaneous scanning with identical slice thickness;  2) full 360 degree scan rotation, scan zoom (up to 40x) and offset with no x/y stage centering; 3) digital scan control will allows for the following hardware/software functionality:  constant scanning velocity for all speeds, even illumination along scanning fields with identical pixel conditions, short fly back time (less than 2% of frame cycle), on-line modification of scanning and detector settings, on-line histogram and lut's for optimization, sample preservation via beam blanking only in regions of interest and FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching); 4)  the system must be capable of scanning at least 0.3 msec or 2600 lines per second;  5) on-line ratioing imaging between channels for high speed FRET correction;  6)  comprehensive physiology software for FRAP, FRET and trigger output for precisely controlled synchronization of signaling;  7)  multi tracking capability via digital scan control, which allows high speed multiplexing of excitation wavelengths by line to get rid of cross talk between channels; 8) single button control to implement identical system conditions from previously collected images and 9) can be upgraded to add a spectral scanner that incorporates a 32 channel PMT.  This system is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  Carl Zeiss Inc. is the only organization known to the NINDS researcher that has all the aforementioned features that are required and believed to be unique. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement and the noted features, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NINDS research to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on June 18, 2002.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor?s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.   NAICS 334516

<DESC>The FDA has a requirement for accurate and timely economic assessments of  FDA regulatory actions.  Activities under the proposed contract will include, although not necessarily be limited to, the following: (1) Methods Development - while the economic impact of certain FDA regulatory actions  can be analyzed via an established methodology, other FDA initiatives will require novel analytical approaches to evaluate potential effects of economic impacts on consumers, the agency, and the regulated industry. (2) Baseline Measurement ? The FDA needs baseline data on the economic characteristics of regulated industries in order to estimate economic impact. These data may include the number and size of firms and the employment, sales, and number of stock keeping units (labels). In some instances, industry profile studies will require supporting documentation for OMB survey clearance procedures. (3)Impact Assessments ? Since the FDA is required to prepare comprehensive Economic Impact Analysis for significant regulations under Executive Order 12866, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the expected impact of each agency rule must be reviewed to determine whether or not it will be considered significant. Both significant and non-significant assessments require extensive familiarity with numerous aspects of the regulated industries. The solicitation will be available on or about 28 June 2002 on the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to procure on a sole source basis to Oregon National Primate Research Center, 505 NW 185th Avenue, Beaverton, Oregon, 97006, for specialized animal technician support.  Specifically, the contractor shall provide specialized technical, biological, and animal care services for National Institute on Aging (NIA)-owned rhesus monkeys that were transferred to the Oregon National Primate Research Center (ONPRC) in support of an ongoing study entitled ?Assessment of Primate Aging: Effects of Caloric Modification,? which is being conducted at the NIH Animal Center in Poolesville, Maryland.  The transfer of these monkeys was necessary to allow project scientists to conduct collaborative studies with several groups of research scientists at the ONPRC.  The ONPRC scientists are recognized international experts in studies of primate metabolism, reproduction, and immune function that are critical to the overall goals of this long-term study.  The studies involve a broad-based assessment of metabolic, reproductive, and immunological function in control and calorie restricted monkeys.  The type of work to be conducted requires highly specialized techniques for sample and data collection.  The scientists involved in the proposed contract, at the ONPRC, are all world recognized experts in conducting the types of studies required for this contract.  The contractor shall provide all the necessary personnel, facilities, supplies, and services not otherwise provided by the government, as needed to perform this contract.  Monkeys shall be housed and cared for using standard veterinary primate practices and in accordance with all NIH and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines for care.  The contractor shall closely monitor animal health, food intake, and body weight for each of the fifty-one (51) monkeys.  The contractor shall also provide all facilities, equipment, technical expertise and services necessary to collect a variety of biological samples to support the collaborative studies being conducted.  In addition, the contractor shall be responsible for all monitoring of animal health during the collection of blood samples and shall work with the veterinary staff to insure overall animal health.  It is believed that the Oregon National Primate Research Center is the sole source for this requirement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 because the unique mix of technical expertise present among the group of Oregon scientists does not, to our knowledge, exist at other institutions capable of conducting such intensive primate studies.  The expertise in certain individual specialties (metabolism, immune function, reproduction) may exist at other institutions.  However, to conduct the specified studies would then require shipment of the monkeys to several facilities.  It is not possible to ship animals between facilities for these studies; therefore, any proposed contractor must have the required expertise in all three physiological areas, as well as experience with non human primates.  Shipment between facilities is not possible for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, the advanced age of several of the primates and the physiological stress of shipment, the long duration of quarantine required each time animals enter a new facility, and the additional complexity and expense of shipment.  The types of studies to be conducted involve highly specialized techniques that are currently utilized at the ONPRC.  No other known source can provide the unique combination of these types of specialized services for metabolic, reproductive, and immune studies.  Without the combined expertise in these various specialized areas at the ONPRC, it would not be possible to conduct the required studies.  Any competing firm that believes it is capable of providing the above requirement is invited to provide sufficient documentation to demonstrate that capability to the Contract Specialist.See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration?s (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research?s (CDER) Office of Pediatric Drug Development and Program Initiatives (OPPDI), in conjunction with FDA?s Office of Women?s Health, are writing a contract to support research on infant outcomes and/or maternal effects in pregnant women exposed to certain pharmaceuticals, which could be used to treat diseases or conditions resulting from a terrorist attack. The nation?s recent experience with bioterrorism has demonstrated that in the event of a terrorist attack it will be necessary to treat pregnant women with pharmaceutical agents for diseases or conditions that might otherwise be fatal.  However, little is known about the safety of most drugs either to the woman or to her developing fetus when used during pregnancy. The objectives of the contracted research will be to develop information on infant outcomes and/or maternal effects in a cohort of women exposed to a drug of interest during pregnancy using large automated healthcare data systems data.  The highest priority is to evaluate infant outcomes; however, a specific contract could also include a component to assess maternal effects of the drug during pregnancy.  Also, a specific contract could study one or more drugs of interest. The contract shall have an eighteen-month basic period of performance. All responsible organizations may submit an offer in response to the solicitation. (NOTE:  Guidelines will be provided with the solicitation.)  This is a new contract (Contract Number 223-02-3003). The Request for Proposal (RFP) will only be available on the FedBizOpps web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Prospective offers are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments.  It is the offeror?s responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of the solicitation and amendments. The RFP should be available for downloading on/about fifteen (15) days after publication of this announcement.  This requirement will be a full and open competitive requirement.  The FDA reserves the right to award without discussions.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons has a requirement for an Architect/Engineering firm to design the expansion of secure housing at the Federal Correctional Complex (FCC) located at Florence, Colorado.

The estimated cost of construction is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 dollars.

<DESC>1. Supervisory Controls

	The Health, Population & Nutrition Specialist (HPNS) is supervised by the SA?DE+ Team Leader and performs under general instructions and guidance from his/her supervisor.  Once general responsibilities and assignments are agreed upon, the Specialist is required to exercise extensive technical and professional judgment in organizing, planning and supervising child survival and reproductive health implementation activities.  This includes identifying the approaches to be taken, resolving problems and conflicts, and meeting deadlines.  The incumbent is required to work with minimum supervision and in collaboration with other offices of USAID/Mozambique, other donors and Ministry of Health (MOH) professionals.  The HPNS is responsible for keeping his/her supervisor appraised of implementation issues related to child survival and reproductive health, and actions to be taken to overcome difficulties and achieve meaningful and quantifiable results.  Completed work is not expected to require substantive modification.  The HPNS?s responsibilities require considerable situational assessment, interpretation, judgment, and timely decision making.  S/he will engage mid- to high-level government officials in policy dialogue regarding matters pertaining to the Mission?s child survival and reproductive health portfolio, including Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI), infectious disease initiatives (polio, malaria), family planning, safe motherhood and integrated maternal and childhood disease control issues.  The HPNS will be primarily responsible for identifying, analyzing, formulating and implementing child survival, infectious disease and family planning and reproductive health programs and activities.  These could include designing, describing and quantifying expected results and performance indicators; providing guidance to implementing partners in making necessary adjustments to program and administrative plans; and preparation of precise, accurate, articulate, complete and professionally written technical documents and program descriptions. 

2. Introduction

	Since the end of the civil war in 1992 and the signing of the peace accords in 1994, Mozambique has been struggling to reestablish its rural health care network destroyed during the war.  It is also trying to establish an adequate management system for the health services; the health service is constrained by high levels of infectious diseases, malnutrition, HIV/AIDS, and limited number of trained health personnel.  USAID continues to be at the forefront in ensuring that services are available to the rural poor where more than 85% of Mozambicans reside.  Since 1998, the USAID has been working to strengthen the ability of the Ministry of Health to deliver essential primary health care at fixed facilities, while U.S. PVOs complement MOH services with community outreach.  USAID?s activities cover more than half of all districts in the country and provide services to an estimated 11.3 million people, including over 2.1 million women of child bearing age and 900,000 children under five years of age.  Currently, over 60% of Mozambicans in these districts (compared to <25% in 1992) now have access to health services.  However, quality remains a concern as staff in many rural facilities have only rudimentary education.  There are only 70 secondary schools in the country and more than 65% of these are located in Maputo, the capital. The MOH employs approximately 18,000 persons at the elementary (52%), basic (29%), intermediate (13%), specialized-intermediate (2.5%), and superior (3.5%) levels.  The elementary level requires no schooling, the basic level requires 3 years of schooling, intermediate level requires 6 years of schooling, and the superior level requires a university degree.  Only a tiny fraction of the 18,000 MOH employees are in the non-clinical professional or administrative classifications.  There are 81 hospital administratorsat the elementary level, 149 at the basic level, 158 at the intermediate level and 12 at the superior (with a bachelor?s degree) level; there are only 16 accountants in the MOH service.  There are only 400 physicians in Mozambique, of whom 25% are specialists.  Mozambique has one of the lowest ratios of doctors to patients in the world (1:35,000).  Most physicians are recent graduates with little public health experience.  For many years to come, Mozambique will continue to rely on foreign talent to help it operate its public health system.  USAID is committed to training Mozambicans to be able to assume more leadership roles in the future through mentoring of junior level personnel.  SAUDE+ has employed a senior level FSN-10 to be mentored by the HPNS for a period of two years, after which it is hoped that the FSN can assume a higher level of responsibility. 

	The HPNS is directly responsible for achieving results associated with child survival and reproductive health under the health (SAUDE+) program.  These are two major activities that were once separate.  In 2000, however, the Mission made a conscious decision to integrate the implementation of these two programs to conform to the MOH structure. S/he provides technical support on child survival and reproductive health issues, as well as STDs and HIV/AIDS.  S/he will also mentor some SAUDE+ staff as possible replacement in the near future.  In this regard, the HPNS performs a wide range and variety of duties of substantial complexity, including consultative, advisory, and monitoring, management, information gathering, processing, and reporting of program performance and accomplishments.  The incumbent provides vital liaison services with Mozambique's professional health community, including the entire spectrum of medical and paramedical personnel, and is responsible for staying abreast of technical developments in the areas of child survival, nutrition and reproductive health. 

	The SA?DE+ portfolio will be approximately $108 million over a six-year period.  The HPNS plays an integral role in the design of all activities related to child survival and reproductive health project documents and the design and management of new activities financed thereunder.  The incumbent will manage certain implementation contracts and awards to non-government organizations working under the SAUDE+ program, as assigned by the Team Leader and Contracting Officer.  In addition, s/he will be responsible for coordinating USAID/Washington-supported projects assigned by the Team Leader.  The HPNS will be called upon to provide technical support as a technical backup for the design and implementation of the Health Sector Support Project or other SAUDE+ activities in the absence of other SAUDE+ team members.

<DESC>On June 12, 2002, this notice was modified to revise the dates the RFQ data will be placed on the website (July 1, 2002), and the due date (July 16, 2002).  
Point of Contact James L. Palmer, Sr. Contract Administrator, 505 665-0743

Firms interested in participating in the two-phased selection process for this design/build project should submit an expression of interest to the point of contact (POC) shown above. 
A.  The objective of the CGR WMRM Project is to mitigate potential damages to waste management facilities and operations that have occurred, or may occur, in the event of a fire or fire-related natural disaster.  Demonstrated vulnerabilities arose during the Cerro Grande fire in May 2000 that presented unacceptable risk to LANL's waste operations grade, and will require significant site excavation.  Geotechnical studies performed to date indicate the site soils will be considered as low-level radioactive waste.  Disposal of this waste is planned for disposal at LANL's Technical Area 54.

      B.	This project provides for additions and modifications to existing equipment, facilities that will mitigate these risks. The new facility and associated equipment will allow RLW to be safely collected and monitored in the event of a fire or other natural disaster.  This subproject adds over 300,000-gallons RLW tank storage, remote influent RLW monitoring/controls, pumps and mixers to supplement existing equipment at TA-50-01.  The equipment will be housed in a new facility, approximately 10,000-ft. in plan area, located at TA-50.  The new facility will be categorized as a Hazard Category 3, Nuclear Facility.  Given that the new facility must collect RLW from incoming gravity drain lines, it will be situated approximately 25-ft. below grade, and will require significant site excavation.  Geotechnical studies performed to date indicate the site soils will be considered as low-level radioactive waste.  Disposal of this waste is planned for disposal at LANL's Technical Area 54.

C.  This pre-solicitation notice is provided to assist Design-Build (DB) firms with planning for an upcoming Request for Qualification (RFQ) and subsequent Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Los Alamos National Laboratory (hereafter Laboratory), Cerro Grande Fire Rehabilitation Team, wishes to contract with a DB firm to provide definitive design and construction services for the subject project.
 
The successful execution of the work will require a DB firm to organize a specialized team with demonstrated definitive design and construction experience as outlined in the forthcoming Request for Qualification (RFQ).  The RFQ will specify the criteria that firms must satisfy to qualify for responding to the subsequent project Request for Proposal (RFP). An RFP is slated for release in July 2002 with contract award planned for November 2002.

I.   This solicitation will use a best-value source selection conducted in two phases. In Phase One, prospective offerors will submit their qualification information. This information will be evaluated by the University to select the prospective offeror(s) that qualify to submit proposals in response to the RFP under Phase Two.  

II.   In Phase One, the RFQ will be posted on or about June 3, 2002 at LANL website   http://bus.lanl.gov/bus5/vendor/solicitations/default.htm with a response due on or about july 16, 2002. The RFQ will include detailed pre-qualification evaluation factors and submittal instructions. Qualification factors may include but not be limited to: (1) demonstrated successful completion of design-build projects similar to this scope of work, with a contract value of at least $20,000,000; (2) experience working with other member(s) of the proposed team on previous design-build construction projects; (3) an acceptable safety record, determined by evaluating the offeror's safety record for three annual periods by using the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Guidelines to determine documented record and lost workdays from the offeror's OSHA 200 logs; and (4) a documented quality assurance program.  Any subsequent revisions to the RFQ will be shown on the referenced Internet website. Although the University will not mail, fax, or e-mail the RFQ pages or any update(s) to the RFQ, the University will send e-mail notifications of updates to interested firms who register with the University for such updates, as instructed on the website. The website is occasionally inaccessible due to maintenance. The University is not responsible for any loss of Internet connectivity or for an offeror(s) inability to access the document posted at the referenced website.   

III.   In Phase Two, the University will accept proposals, submitted in response to the  RFP, only from the offeror(s) selected in Phase One.

<DESC>The Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Integration Systems Program Office, ESC, Hanscom AFB, MA, is seeking responsible contractors to design, develop, integrate, produce, test, and field Advanced Remote Ground Unattended Sensors (ARGUS). ARGUS will be the next-generation family of unattended sensors that will initially include a seismic and acoustic sensor suite and a communications package, all housed in an aerodynamic delivery body.  The aerobody will require an open architecture design for ease of future sensor and aircraft integration. Hand-in-place configurations, remote-monitoring stations, communications interfaces, mission planning tools, and pre-deployment checkout equipment will also be required.  An Acquisition Ombudsman, Colonel Joseph P. Maryeski, Director, Commander's Staff, has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during proposal development.  You should only contact the Ombudsman with issues or problems you cannot satisfactorily resolve with the program manager and/or contracting officer.  The Ombudsman role is to hear concerns, issues, and recommendations and communicate these to the appropriate government personnel.  The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality if desired.  The Ombudsman does not evaluate proposals or participate in source selections.  You can contact the Ombudsman at (781) 377-5106. See Note 26.

<SOLNBR>DACW31-02-T-0048
<RESPDATE>070502
<ARCHDATE>08042002
<CONTACT>William  Epps, (410)962-5610
<DESC>NA F110-- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District intends to Award a contract to Aztec Dredging Company to performance the following service in conjunction with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and USFWS have agreed to develop a marsh  restoration feasibility study at the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. One method to increase the acreage of wetlands is to increase the elevation of the existing marsh and the adjacent mud flats.  The project is a demonstration as to whether it is fea sible for equipment to maneuver around in Blackwater Wildlife Refuge and be able to accurately jet spray to reach strict elevations without causing additional erosion to the existing marsh. At present there are 3-4 areas that will be used as a demonstratio n that needs accurate thin layering. Accomplishing this in very shallow waters will take a specialized piece of equipment as well as actual experience with marsh restoration. The Contractor with the specialized equipment required to meet our requirements a nd specifications, along with the expertise is the Aztec Dredging Company.  Aztec has been performing this type of operation for a number of years.  While any dredger could pump dredged material into the air it takes expertise to apply this method in a saf e and environmentally acceptable manner.  The aerial or jet spraying of the slurry, which should be thin and lateral, permits the build up of material into the area receiving the sediment.  This must be controlled accurately and must be fine-tuned in the f ield.  Aztec has both the experience and the necessary equipment.  Their patent on a high-pressure nozzle allows for a fine mist of material to be distributed over a wide area. In addition the nozzle needs to be adjustable to allow for pressure changes and  fine tune application into a marsh.  The apparatus needed to build up a wide area needs to be mobile and able to enter extremely shallow (2-3 feet) areas.  The Aztec dredge system can do this and the nozzle end can also be mounded at a distance from the d redge to allow for a larger area of coverage.  This will still allow the slurry to be accurately regulated and controlled.  Also, the equipment may need to be transferred to a remote site accessible only by road.  The Aztec equipment can be mounted on a ve hicle that is translated over the area by a cable system that may be hydraulically powered utilizing the pressure of the pumped slurry. The Baltimore District in only aware of Aztec as the company that has the equipment and expertise to conduct this demons tration.  The demonstration is needed to occur between June and early August of year 2002. The Point of Contact for Technical Information is Mr. Robert Blama (4100962-6068. The requirement is a Small Business Set-Aside Action. All responsible sources can d ownload a copy of bid package at http://ebs.nab.usace.army.mil/. No telephone or fax request for the solicitation package will be accepted. See numbered note 1 and 22, except change the forty-five (45) days to twenty-one (21) days.
