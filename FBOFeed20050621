DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The intent of this project is to provide catch basin structures that can be closed during aircraft deicing operations to prevent the flow of liquid deicing fluid into the storm water drainage system.

Airfield pavement will not be removed or damaged during construction. The structures will be cast specifically for each catch basin and during installation they will be set into the catch basins and properly sealed to the surrounding concrete or asphalt pavement to prevent leaks. The catch basin inserts must be designed and installed so that they may be easily opened and closed by aircraft maintenance personnel. The applicable NAICS Code is 237110 with a small business size standard of $17.0 Million. The magnitude of construction is between $100,000 and 250,000.

RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described i! n the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government. CAR-M01  ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification!  for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revi! sed performance data becomes available.  (d) RYG Classifications are summarized as follows:  (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.  (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.  (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment! , Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.  FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NLSC at the above address.  The request must include the requester’s name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NLSC will provide each supplier, without charge, with an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing its individual data. The following provisions with a "FILL-IN" must be filled out completely and submitted with the offer: 52.219-1[FILL-IN]; 52.222-22 [FILL-IN]; 52.222-25[FILL-IN].

Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at www.ccr.gov.

RYG is authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for the acquisition of commodities used to build and maintain the Fleet--materials, parts and components of ships, planes and weapons systems. (B) The Government reserves the right to awa! rd to the contractor whose offer represents the best overall purchase value to the Government. As such, the basis for contract award will include an evaluation of proposed contractor's quality performance history. The price to be considered in determining the best value will be the evaluated price after Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEA) or related quality assurance actions, as applicable, are applied to the offered price. (C) The procedures described in the clause of this solicitation entitled "ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTORS--CONTRACTOR EVALUATION SYSTEM, RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (MAY 1992)" will be used by the Contracting Officer to assist in determining the best purchase value for the Government - price, past quality performance and other factors considered.

Design or Engineering Services are required for an Indefinite Quantity Contract for Design and Professional Engineering Services required for Compliance with Drinking Water and Air Emission Regulations within the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Atlantic's Area of Responsibility (AOR).  Projects can be categorized as design or engineering services projects.  Projects related to drinking water shall include, but not be limited to:  drinking water quality compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and Environmental Final Governing Standards (FGS) to include water quality evaluations, compliance and condition assessments, watershed and aquifer studies, hydraulic modeling, pilot-treatability studies; source and sanitary surveys; corrosion control studies; Cross Connection and Backflow Prevention surveys; and development of Management Action Plans, mapping of distribution systems, wellhead protection assessments, water system vulnerability assessments and auxiliary services such as operator training programs and operations and maintenance manuals.  Projects related to air emissions shall include, but not be limited to:  air emission source surveys; preparation of air permit applications; computer estimation of air pollutants; testing of emissions from emission sources; installation of air pollution control equipment; and project documentation, plans, specifications, cost estimates and related studies.  The AOR for the contract includes the Continental United States (CONUS) and overseas including the Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.  Overseas work will primarily be located in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; Bahrain; Djibouti; Greece; Iceland; Italy; and Spain.  Knowledge of all applicable Federal, State, regional and local laws and regulations, as well as overseas environmental laws and regulations associated with air and water, are required.  Applicable laws and regulations include, but are not limited to the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA), SDWA, Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (DOD Publication 4715.5G), and FGS where published.

Typical taskings for drinking water may include water quality evaluations, compliance and condition assessments (including full water analysis capability; physical, chemical and biological treatment for potable waters; membrane technology for treating potable water, watershed and aquifer studies, hydraulic modeling, pilot-treatability studies, corrosion control studies, Cross Connection and Backflow Prevention surveys; development of Management Action Plans; mapping of distribution systems; wellhead protection assessments and preparation of reports and applications to be used in compliance and permit negotiations with regulators; auxiliary services include operator training programs, operations and maintenance manuals and source and sanitary surveys; preparation of detailed construction scoping documents with budget estimates and witness data sketches (DD Form 1391).  Typical taskings for air emissions may include air emission statements, air dispersion modeling, stack testing, compliance studies, ozone depleting substance survey and phase-out, radon testing/mitigation, design of emission control equipment and surveys of physical properties for compliance with host nation design and building requirements related to air emission systems.  Taskings may have very short time frames as they result from enforcement actions directed to Navy or Marine Corps permittees by regulators.

The contract requires that the selected firm have on-line access to E-mail via the Internet for routine exchange of correspondence.

The A&E must demonstrate his and each key consultant's qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors for all environmental engineering services and optional services.  Evaluation Factors are weighted with (1) and (2) being the most important; factors (3) through (6) are of equal importance; and factors (7) and (8) are of lesser importance and will be used as tie-breakers among technically equal firms.  Specific evaluation factors include:

1.  Specialized Experience:  Firms and consultants (if proposed) will be evaluated in terms of their recent experience (last 5 years) in performing environmental services associated with client compliance with Drinking Water regulations and Air Emissions laws and regulations.  Specialized experience is required in water quality evaluations, compliance, condition and vulnerability assessments (including potable waters; membrane technology for treating potable water, watershed and aquifer studies, hydraulic modeling, and pilot-treatability studies, corrosion control studies, Cross Connection and Backflow Prevention Surveys, development of Management Action Plans, mapping of distribution systems, wellhead protection assessments; air emission inventories; air permitting; air dispersion modeling; stack testing and air emission control equipment evaluation and design.  Demonstrated expertise with regulatory aspects of SDWA, CAA and overseas drinking water and air pollution standards and regulations are required.

2.  Professional Qualifications and Technical Competence of the individual Technical Team Members in the types of work identified in Evaluation Factor 1.  The team will be evaluated on and must document:
(a) Active professional registration of the engineering/technical staff.
(b) Past experience of the technical staff in performing the services described in Evaluation Factor 1.
(c) Familiarity with SDWA and CAA, Environmental Final Governing Standards, Navy policies related to drinking water and air emissions, and host nation regulations interrelated to the FGS.
(d) Capability to provide qualified backup staffing for key personnel to ensure continuity of services and ability to surge to meet unexpected project demands.

3.  Ability to perform the work to schedules and capacity to accomplish a variation of 5 taskings simultaneously.  Firms will be evaluated in terms of impact of this workload on the technical staff's projected workload during the contract period.

4.  Past Performance:  Firms will be evaluated in past performance with this Command, other DOD agencies, and private companies in terms of demonstrated long term business relationships and repeat business (with emphasis on projects addressed in Evaluation Factor 1).  Firms should include any letters of commendation or awards.  Firms will also be evaluated on their demonstrated history of meeting negotiated project schedules and producing high quality work.

5.  Quality Control Program:  Firms will be evaluated on the acceptability of their internal quality control program used to ensure technical accuracy in reports, to assure overall coordination between engineering and technical disciplines, and their means of ensuring quality services from their consultant laboratories.

6.  Firm location in the general geographical area of the contract and knowledge of the locality of the contract; provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract.  Firms should demonstrate the ability to support Navy and Marine Corps installations in the CONUS and overseas AOR with regard to drinking water and air related work.  Firms will be evaluated on their proximity and familiarity with major fleet concentration areas of CONUS and Europe.

7.  Volume of Work:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by DOD within the past 12 months with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DOD A&E contracts among qualified A&E firms, including small and small disadvantaged business firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.

8.  Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan:  Firms will be evaluated on the extent to which they identify and commit to the published Small Business Subcontracting Program.  The Secretary of the Navy has assigned the Naval Facilities Engineering Command goals expressed in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars for utilization of small businesses of 74.85%.  Included in the SB goals are targets for:  Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) - 15.60%; Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) - 13.92%; Veterans Owned Small Business (VOSB) - 0.12%; Services Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) - 0.12%; and HUBZone Small Business - 1.17%.

Large business firms shall submit their Navy-wide SF 295, Summary Subcontract Report with their SF 330.  The slated firms will be required to provide a preliminary subcontracting plan (support for small business subcontracting) as part of the interview.

The duration of the contract will be for one (1) year from the date of an initial contract award with 4 additional one year option periods.  The total amount that may be paid under this contract (including option years) will not exceed $5,000,000 for the entire contract term.  The minimum guarantee for the entire contract term (including option years) will be satisfied by the award of the initial Task Order.  The options may be exercised within the time frame specified in the resultant contract at the sole discretion of the Government subject to workload and/or satisfaction of the A&E performance under the subject contract.  There will be no dollar limit per task order and no dollar limit per year.  No other general notification to firms for other similar projects performed under this contract will be made.  Type of contract:  Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Quantity Contract.  Estimated start date September 2005.  This proposed contract is being solicited on an unrestricted basis; therefore, replies to this notice are requested from all business concerns.  The small business size standard classification is NAICS 541330 ($4,000,000).

All contractors are advised that registration in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database is required prior to award of a contract.

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) anticipates developing a laser 3-D Vision technology for Robotic and Manned Lunar Surface Exploration under the Advanced Space Technology Program (ASTP) segment of the Human and Robotic Technology (H&RT) initiative.  The laser ranging and imaging systems to be studied here consist of a space-qualified laser transmitter, detector, and timing electronics.   In Phase I of this two-phase project, an electronic timing circuit (time of flight, or TOF chip) will be evaluated for suitability in a prototype system.  Tests will be carried out to determine whether the technologies can meet the unique environmental constraints of the space and Lunar environment including thermal, radiation, and contamination.  In addition, the technological maturity will be evaluated for the prototype system. The principal objective of Phase II will be the fabrication and testing of the prototype 3-D robotic vision system or systems capable of addressing one or more of the mission scenarios analyzed in the Phase I reports.   Because at the present time only the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in Laurel, MD has designed, developed, and flown in space a single chip electronic timing circuit (the patented Time of Flight, or TOF, chip) suitable in terms of both configuration and performance to the specifications of the laser vision system under consideration, GSFC intends to make a single-source award to the University for this acquisition.  The governing statutory provision is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), “Only One Responsible Source.”  JHU/APL’s responsibility under the Laser 3-D Vision project will be to evaluate the suitability (and adaptability) of its TOF technology vis à vis other existing and emergent technologies which at present only JHU/APL has the resources to do.  In addition, results from Phase I of this project must be presented to NASA Headquarters at a meeting scheduled for November 2005.	Given this six-month time constraint, another source would have to have the TOF chip available immediately so that testing may be completed and the results analyzed by the November meeting.  Other offerors who have a comparable space-qualified TOF chip that may be applied to this 3-D vision system within the time constraint, and are interested in demonstrating their ability to meet these requirements, are invited to submit a written statement of their capabilities, qualifications, and space-qualified timing circuit specifications to Dr. Carol Barton by e-mail at cbarton@pop200.gsfc.nasa.gov, or by post at 8800 Greenbelt Road, Building 11, M/S 210.3, Greenbelt, MD 20771, not later than 12:00 PM (noon) EDST on 06 July 2005. Submissions made by any other means will not be considered. Responses will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether this procurement should proceed on a single source basis.  After a thorough evaluation of all responsible proposals received by the indicated deadline, any determination by the Government that a full and open competition for this effort will or will not be conducted will be made solely at the agency’s discretion. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Sensor Sense of the Netherlands for an ethylene detector.  This detector is capable of the following:  1) measuring ethylene with a fast response time (5-10 seconds), which is necessary to characterize the atmospheric variability in pollutant concentrations that exist close to emission sources.  2) has a high sensitivity (0.1 ppbv), the study design calls for flights near ethylene emission sources, where atmospheric mixing ratios can be as high as 100 ppbv, and to follow theses plumes over 100s of kilometers, during which the mixing ratio decreases to below 1 ppbv due to dilution and chemical removal.  3) laser spectroscopic method, and its high spectral resolution to provide interference-free detection of ethylene under atmospheric conditions.  4) lightweight instrument suitable for aircraft that can be operated unattended.  This unit will be used for an upcoming aircraft field study in 2006.  It is the government’s belief that there is no other company capable of providing an instrument to meet the required specifications.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13.1, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100K).  This notice is for information purposes only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Anticipated award date is July 8, 2005.

2.	The Fence System shall originate at one side of the institution’s rear gate sallyport, transition overtop of an Administration Building and end at the opposite side of the rear gate sallyport.  The Fence System shall be continuous with no breaks in the fencing structure except at the rear gate sallyport.

3.	The Fence System shall be installed as a stand-alone system and be capable of detecting intrusion attempts by zone number.  Zone lengths shall not exceed 300'.

Phase One solicitations will be issued on/about May 24, 2005.  The Phase One proposal due date will be identified in the Phase One Solicitation.  The Phase One solicitation will provide the scope of work, and the following evaluation factors, which are all in descending order of importance: 1) Past Performance; 2) Technical Qualifications; and 3)Technical Approach.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to Professor Marsha Blumenthal to provide Advisory & Assistance services for development and design of a survey to measure burden incurred by taxpayers in complying with the federal tax law for the Office of Research in accordance with the attached Statement of Work. The objectives of IRS' investment in developing information in the tax-exempt area are: to provide information to the Executives and Operating Divisions for assessing the burden of obtaining tax-exempt status; to provide information to a variety of customers concerned with tax-exempt issues; to help senior management determine what part of the tax-exempt process IRS can influence; to facilitate the understanding of the impact of legislation on this burden; and to provide an integrated, comprehensive mechanism to fulfill  Office of Management and Budget requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act.  The expectations are:  1.) Extensive qualitative research will be relied upon to inform the development of all of the other project tasks and will become the basis for the conceptual framework of the project. 2.) The data collection will be focused primarily on federal tax exemption.  3.) The collection of data will be done through a survey which may be sub-contracted. 4.) An incentive may be used to improve response rates – the amount must be agreed upon in advance of surveying. 5.) The data collected will be analyzed on both total and per organization bases and findings will be compiled in a written report. 6.) Potential uses for the data will be considered, and the data gathered shall align with these uses. 7.) The data will be adaptable for the broad needs of IRS. 8.) Providing IRS with a tool for quantitative measurement of time and out-of-pocket costs for obtaining tax-exempt status is a project goal.  Ideally, the data will be useable with burden model data now being developed. 9.) Qualitative data about state practices may be included. 10.) Customers will be consulted throughout the project. The deliverables shall include: 1.) Literature review; 2.) Project methodology design document and/or briefing including results from qualitative research; 3.) Security briefing; 4.) Survey sample design document finalized; 5.) Survey questionnaire and introductory letters finalized; 6.) OMB package prepared for submission; 7.) Monthly reports on survey progress; 8.) Survey completion; 9.) Briefing on preliminary findings including an analysis of the non-response; 10.) Analysis of survey results and final report. All deliverables shall be provided by soft copies utilizing one of the following tools for readability to the Office of Research:  Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, SAS, C++, or JAVA. The period of performance shall be a base period of one year with one optional period and will include FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services. This is subject to disclosure and privacy acts provisions. The evaluation criteria are as follows: 
The capability of the contractor to measure burden on applicants for tax exemption by means of a survey based on a scientifically designed stratified sample (to be administered either by the contractor or a sub-contractor). Evidence of  knowledge of and experience with the populations covered by this study.  Background and sophistication for analyzing the measurements of time and out-of-pocket costs. Evidence of ability to identify and understand the sources of the burden, their impact on customers of the process, the implications for tax administrators, and potential tax administration options or alternatives available. Knowledge and experience with technical writing, preferably in the tax-exempt area. Experience in tax compliance, preferably in the tax-exempt area. This is 100% set aside for small business, under simplified acquisition procedures.  All responsible sources that can provide the above requirements must demonstrate their capabilities in writing no later than 15 days after the published date of this announcement. No written solicitations will be issued for this requirement; therefore such request will be considered non-responsive. Offerors may submit capabilities by facsimile, mail, or email. Responses over 10 pages in total will only be accepted by mail or email. Award will be based on the most advantageous offeror to the Government, price and other factors considered. All questions must be submitted in writing and received by facsimile or email to Adrienne Spruill, Contract Specialist, Phone (202) 283-1183, Fax (202) 283-1534, Email  adrienne.m.spruill@irs.gov

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Department of Transportation (DOT), National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), has a requirement to acquire a contractor to study and examine the effects of publicity, education, enforcement and engineering changes on drivers speeding in local neighborhoods and on pedestrian crashes for a thirty-six (36) months period.  The title of the required study is “The Heed the Speed Pedestrian Safety Program”.

This same study was previously conducted in 2003 in two neighboring Arizona cities—Phoenix and Peoria.  Three neighborhoods/streets were selected for study in each city.  Heed the Speed was selected as the slogan for the speed reduction program and educational materials were developed for the program including street and lawn signs that displayed the slogan and logo, print materials for homeowners, parents, drivers, (including high school drivers), press releases for the two cities, inputs for homeowner’s association newsletters, and radio spots.  Earned media included write-ups in local papers and participation in local television programs.  Enforcement activities included special enforcement, training citizens to conduct neighborhood watches and deployment of speed trailers and photo speed enforcement trailers.  Roadway treatments included installation of speed humps and tables and application of products to the roadway surface that gave an illusion of a roadway impediment or engineering treatment.

The Government may reserves the right to conduct a pre-award survey or may require other evidence of financial capability to perform the work described in the solicitation, prior to the award of the contract.  The period of performance is thirty-six (36) months. 
The solicitation and any related documents for this procurement will be made available to interested parties through electronic media available for downloading via the Internet at Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be available.  

Potential offeror(s) shall be responsible for monitoring the Internet site for the release of the solicitation, amendments (if any), and responses to any questions submitted in accordance with the solicitation provisions.  This is a small business set aside solicitation for a Firm Fixed Price Contract, and all responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by the agency.  Tentative procurement milestones for this requirement are:  (1) Issuance of the RFP on or about June 1, 2005, (2) Proposals due on or about June 24, 2005.  These tentative milestones are provided for contractor planning purposes and are subject to slight variations by the Government.  Contractor’s request for extensions may not be granted.

<DESC>MODIFIED SOLICITATION NOTICE DATED 21 JUN 2005 - THE ISSUANCE OF PHASE I IS BEING POSTPONED FROM 22 JUNE UNTIL ON OR ABOUT 29 JUNE 2005. ALL OTHER INFORMATION REMAINS UNCHANGED.....
THIS PRE-SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED UNRESTRICTED FOR ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF UP TO FIVE SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) DESIGN-BUILD/100% PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH TWO MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8a, HUBZONE, OR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN CONTRACTOR. The SIC Code for this Solicitation is 236210: Industrial Building Construction. The Size Standard is $28,500,000. Task Orders will primarily consist of new construction, roofing, demolition, routine renovation and repair of facilities and infrastructure including: 1-aviation and aircraft facilities, 2-marine facilities, 3-barracks and personnel housing facilities, 4-administrative facilities, 5-warehouses and supply facilities, 6-abatement and handling of hazardous/regulated materials (including and not limited to asbestos, lead paint and PCBs), for the Area of Responsibility (AOR) of ROICC Key West, FL.Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that will result in awards based on BEST VALUE to the Government, price and other factors considered. Each contract will be for one base year with four one-year options. The total 5 year (base year and 4 option years) estimated construction costs for all of the IDIQ contracts is NTE $30,000,000. Projects will vary in size from around $100,000.00 to $3,000,000.00. The minimum guarantee is $25,000.00 for each contract. If a minimum of two offerors remain in the pool during contract duration, this will satisfy the competitive requirements and preclude the necessity of soliciting for a replacement contractor if for any reason one of the contracts is terminated or one of the offerors is excluded from participation in the process. This procurement will include potential award for two 8a eligible, HUBZone eligible or Service Disabled Veteran eligible contractors. These contractors will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II.  If an 8a, HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the contract will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such. The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features. Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state.  

Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven (7) proposers (design-build teams), unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than seven (7) is in the Government’s interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of two-phase design build contracting. The narrowing phase is based on design-build factors that include:  Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Experience, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), and Management Approach.  Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five (5) year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects (new construction and renovation) including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, abatement and handling of hazardous/regulated materials (including and not limited to asbestos, lead paint and  PCBs), and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  An 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor (two) that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II.  If more than two 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractors with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II.  The successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders.  Otherwise eligible 8(a), HUBZone, and Service Disabled Veteran contractors are invited to participate on an unrestricted basis as appropriate.   If the successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction.  Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope/design options with the Government’s published budget for award. The offeror with the best value proposal for the seed project will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD AT LEAST FIVE CONTRACTS.  THE OFFERORS PROVIDING THE HIGHEST RATED BEST VALUE.  PROPOSALS WILL BE AWARDED A CONTRACT WITH A MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF $25,000; THE HIGHEST RATED OF THOSE FIVE WILL BE AWARDED THE SEED PROJECT THAT WILL BE THE FIRST TASK ORDER.  The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 22 June 2005.  Phase II will be issued at a later date.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
June 21, 2005
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division, in Clarksburg, West Virginia, provides identification services based on fingerprints, and maintains a national criminal and civil history repository of fingerprint identification information.  Since 1999, the FBI has performed identification services using the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS).  The IAFIS is designed to process fingerprint information electronically in a paperless manner.
The National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact Act of 1998 (Compact) (title 42, United States Code, sections 14611-14616) provides a legal framework for the cooperative exchange of criminal history records for noncriminal justice purposes.  The Compact established a fifteen-member National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact Council (Council), whose members are appointed by the United States Attorney General, to promulgate rules, procedures, and standards governing the use of the Interstate Identification Index (III) criminal history record information (CHRI) for noncriminal justice purposes.  Accordingly, the Council published the "Outsourcing of Noncriminal Justice Administrative Functions" Interim Final Rule (IFR) and the related "Security and Management Control Outsourcing Standards" Notice in the Federal Register on December 16, 2004.  The intent of the IFR is to permit an Authorized Recipient of CHRI to outsource noncriminal justice administrative functions relating to the processing of CHRI to a third party, subject to appropriate controls.
The IFR states that contracts or agreements providing for the outsourcing authorized by the rule "shall incorporate by reference a security and management control outsourcing standard approved by the Compact Council after consultation with the United States Attorney General."  The Security and Management Control Outsourcing Standards (Outsourcing Standards) are the standards referenced in the Outsourcing Rule.  The Council developed two Outsourcing Standards B one for contractors having access to CHRI on behalf of an Authorized Recipient for noncriminal justice purposes and one for contractors serving as Channelers of noncriminal justice criminal history record check requests and results.  The terms Authorized Recipient, Channeler, and Contractor are defined in the Security and Management Control Outsourcing Standards.
The purpose of this RFI is to gather information on the number and capabilities of contractors interested in serving as Channelers pursuant to the Council's Outsourcing Rule and Standards.  No new Channelers will be selected/approved based upon responses to this RFI.  Contractors interested in becoming an approved Channeler (including existing private entities and regulatory agencies that currently serve as Channelers in some capacity and are interested in expanding their customer base) are requested to respond to this RFI.  The FBI will review the responses and anticipate publishing a future request for interested parties to apply to become a Channeler.  The number of Channelers that will eventually be approved is unknown at this time, not to exceed 50; however, the FBI will strive to strike a balance between the number of Channelers it has the capability to administer and the number needed to effectively and efficiently serve the needs of Authorized Recipients.  The FBI will provide the approved Channelers access to the CJIS Wide Area Network (WAN).  For information, during Fiscal Year 2004, regulatory agencies that served as channelers forwarded to the FBI approximately eight hundred thousand statutorily authorized applicant submissions; additionally, federal agencies forwarded directly to the FBI approximately four million applicant submissions.
In responding to this RFI, an interested party should consider and provide information concerning its capability to perform the requirements listed below.  An approved Channeler shall:  (1) Agree to receive authorized noncriminal justice applicant fingerprint (applicant) submissions, which the Channeler will process and transmit to the FBI as digitized electronic records in the Electronic Fingerprint Transmission Specification (EFTS) format.  Channelers must process at least three thousand applicant submissions annually.  (2) Ensure that all fingerprint submissions are properly and adequately completed and are being submitted in accordance with a legally authorized noncriminal justice purpose.  (3) Charge and collect the FBI fee for the processing of noncriminal justice applicant submissions.  Channelers may charge an additional fee for Channeler services.  (4) Submit payment of the FBI fee to the FBI within thirty (30) calendar days from the date upon which it receives a bill from the FBI for those fingerprint submissions processed during the preceding month.  (5) Agree to receive fingerprint search results and disseminate the results timely and appropriately.  (6) Pay for all equipment (including maintenance) and telecommunication network costs.  (7) Assume responsibility for all necessary labor, equipment, computers, scanners, printers, storage devices, supplies, consumable materials, and facilities.  (8) Abide by the Council's Outsourcing Rule and Channeler Outsourcing Standard which requires the Contractor to maintain a security program to include, among other things, consideration of site security, dissemination restrictions, personnel security, system security, and data security.  (9) Execute the CJIS Systems User Agreement and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding.  (10) Ensure Contractor personnel are trained and comply with all federal and state laws, regulations, and standards (including the CJIS Security Policy) as well as rules, procedures, and standards established by the Council and the United States Attorney General.  (11) Make its facilities available for announced and unannounced security inspections and audits by the Authorized Recipient and the FBI.  (12) Maintain operations within any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
Interested parties, including existing Channelers and those interested in becoming a Channeler, are requested to respond to the following:  (1) Years and breadth of experience as a Channeler, if applicable, and the number of fingerprints the entity/agency is capable of submitting and the number it expects to submit, to the FBI annually.  (2) A detailed description of how you plan to facilitate the handling and prompt electronic submission of applicant fingerprints to the FBI.  (3) Whether you plan to service the channeling needs of a specific industry to which you are affiliated or plan to pursue expanding your service to other industries that submit fingerprints to the FBI.  (4) List of potential customers.  (5) The Channeler's ability to perform basic processing functions such as screening, fine sorting, batching, distribution, and the proper handling, deposit, and disbursement of funds.  (6) Plans for the development of instructions and information for dissemination to participating Authorized Recipients regarding the procedures to be followed to ensure the adequacy of the channeling system.  This would involve the creation of strategies for the resolution of problems relating to:  (a) Incomplete or missing data on the applicant submissions, and/or illegible (i.e., unclassifiable) fingerprints; (b) Payment of fees, i.e., no payment, overpayment, underpayment, credit memorandums, etc.; (c) Reasonable inquiries by agencies and applicants regarding processing status of an applicant submission; and (d) request for special or expedited processing based on extenuating circumstances.
Parties with the capability and/or interest in serving as a noncriminal justice outsourcing Channeler to the FBI are requested to respond (at no cost to the government) with a capabilities statement.  Interested parties are encouraged to include in your responses any criteria/qualifications you would like the FBI to consider when Channelers are eventually selected/approved.  An original and two copies of the response must be submitted by COB July 21, 2005.  Responses should be forwarded to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Information Technology Contracts Unit, Attention:  Kathrina L. Sliger, Module E-3, 1000 Custer Hollow Road, Clarksburg, West Virginia, 26306 or faxed to 304-625-5391.  NOTE:  This RFI is for information-gathering purposes only; no Channelers will be selected or approved based upon responses to this RFI.

<DESC>Request for Information for a Material Handling Equipment 
Safety Net

The Air Force is requesting information concerning mature technologies, which meet the requirements as stated, to be used in a Battlelab concept demonstration.  The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical system available to support the requirements.  All responsible offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  

Description of Potential Initiative 

AFOSH standards require personnel working on the Tunner to wear fall protection when the Tunner deck height exceeds 10 feet.  Current procedures require the wear of a harness connected by a lanyard to the deck of the Tunner.  The harness and lanyard limit personal mobility and can snag on equipment and cargo on the loader.  Use of a barrier at the rear of the Tunner would eliminate the requirement for personnel to wear the harness and lanyard.  


Requirements for MHE Safety Net Initiative	

The barrier must comply with AFOSHSTD 91-501 para.  16.4.6.10

16.4.6.10. Platforms other than buckets or baskets shall include a guardrail system:

16.4.6.10.1. The guardrail system shall include a top rail around its upper periphery. The top rail shall be 42 inches high, above the platform surface, designed to withstand 300 pounds of force.

16.4.6.10.2. The guardrail system shall include at least one rail approximately midway between the top rail and the platform surface, designed to withstand 300 pounds of force.

16.4.6.10.3. The platform shall include toeboards on all sides. The minimum toeboard height shall be 4 inches. Toeboards may be omitted at the access opening.

16.4.6.10.4. The configuration of the aerial platform shall include access for personnel entering the platform when it is in the lowered position. Access steps or rungs shall have a slip-resistant surface. Flexible materials such as cables, chains, and rope may be used across access openings not more than 30 inches wide.


The barrier (minus attachment apparatus) must also be able to be stored either on the vehicle or in the cab of the vehicle.

Vehicle (Tunner) is 171 inches wide at its widest point


SUBMISSIONS

Product Information may be submitted until 16:30 (4:30EST) 31 Jul 2005.  Offerors shall submit unclassified, non-proprietary white papers that should not exceed five pages plus cover letter. Additionally, the Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Refer technical questions and submit product information to Mrs. Roseclair Thompson, 305 Contracting Squadron, McGuire AFB, NJ 08641.  Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.

No solicitation will be available.  The draft BOA and the BOA submittal requirements are posted on FED BIZ OPPS in conjunction with this announcement.  The United States Coast Guard Civil Engineering Unit Oakland is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) firms serviced by SBA District Offices in Washington, Oregon, and California, and other 8(a) participants with bona-fide places of business in Washington, Oregon, and California to participate in a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) Pilot Program.  BOAs are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U.S. Small Business Administration.  The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the US Coast Guard, Civil Engineering Unit (CEU) Oakland, and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of construction services, if and when ordered. The BOA contains contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to all task orders issued under the BOA according to the dollar amount of each task order.  Annually, CEU Oakland will review the continued need for the BOA in light of (a) a usefulness and need for service and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.  The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program for new entrants twice a year.  Under the BOA 8(a) firms compete on task orders for construction and construction related service requirements pursuant to the BOA.  General contractors are preferred, but specialty contractors will be considered as well.  Individual projects will be solicited and awarded if and when required. CEU Oakland gives no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Coast Guard to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that the Coast Guard solicit and acquire covered services from that contractor only. The anticipated construction work may require a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks. The anticipated construction work to be covered under the BOAs include, but is not limited to, new construction, minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, alterations, repairs (emergency and routine)), handling of hazardous waste and material, maintenance, mechanical, electrical, heating/air conditioning, painting, paving, earthwork, demolition, installing pipelines, and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls only).   Construction projects covered under the BOA are for work performed in the NAICS Subsector Codes 236 (formerly 233), 237 (formerly 234), and 238 (formerly 235).  GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers Coast Guard and government installations in Washington, Oregon, and California.  PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  The performance period for the BOA is three (3) years with the Government reserving the right to grant extensions for up to two (2) additional years with no single extension exceeding one year OR until the firm graduates from the 8(a) program, whichever occurs first.  Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly.  The Agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. Either party may cancel the agreement with 60 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on task orders issued prior to the effective date of cancellation. SOLICITATIONS: Each project solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror, and evaluation criteria and the basis for award to be used for each project.  The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, may consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price.  If the award basis will be on price alone, the Contractor may be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000.  CEU Oakland will require Performance and Payment Bonds on each Task order over $25,000. The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and profit at any time. ORDERS: Individual projects will be awarded using the Optional Form 347 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract. LIMITATION OF ORDERS: The range will be from $2,000 to a maximum of $3,000,000.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane." The US Marine Corps and US Navy are currently seeking sources for a 30x173mm programmable fuzed, Air-Bursting ammunition.  Proposed 30x173mm ammunition shall be a Non-Developmental Item (NDI).   The Marine Corps Direct Reporting Program Manager – Advanced Amphibious Assault (DRPM-AAA) and NAVSEA, PEO-IWS3C/PM-4 and PM Unit of Action Lethality System Integration (Program of Interest only) are conducting market research to determine the commercial availability of programmable fuzed, Air-Bursting 30mmx173 ammunition with point detonation and delay capability.  The ammunition shall be capable of defeating both Infantry (PASGT configured) and multiple types of light materiel targets, such as trucks, BTR’s, individual and groups of threat soldiers, ATGM sites and Lightly Fortified Infantry Emplacements (LFIE’s), when presented in either exposed, partially exposed or defilade conditions.  In addition, the ammunition must be capable of defeating small, high-speed water borne surface!  targets such as Jet Skis obscured by wave troughs.  The ammunition shall be capable of defeating land and water surface targets in an engagement range interval of 200 meters (maximum all-arm range) up to 2500 meters (Threshold); the desired maximum engagement range is 4000 meters (Objective).  Minimum safe all arm distance shall be not less than 50 meters.  Ammunition shall function safely and reliably through the MK44 30mm Automatic Cannon equipped with a 0 – 7.5 degree, full gain twist chrome barrel.  Ammunition shall function safely and reliably over the operational temperature range of -25 to + 125 degrees Fahrenheit (-32 to +52 degrees Celsius).  The ammunition and associated system shall be capable of being fully integrated into the MK44 Automatic Cannon and MK46 Weapon System.  The US Marine Corps and the US Navy anticipate award of a contract for this ammunition by June 2005 with deliveries commencing 180 days after contract award in order to conduct live fire balli! stic and lethality performance and complete safety/environmental testing.  Upon completion of testing and with the concurrence of the US Navy Weapon System Explosive Safety Review Board (WSESRB), the US Marine Corps and the US Navy intend to select a single ammunition design to procure for use in the MK46 Weapons System.  Estimated US Marine Corps/US Navy production procurement quantities of 30x173mm programmable fused Air-bursting ammunition are in excess of 500,000 over roughly a ten-year period.  Companies responding to this FedBizOps shall provide any test, pictorial, analytical, and safety data available that provides analysis and/or verification of the inherent performance capabilities and operational safety/suitability of the ammunition design.  The US Government would be interested in witnessing any demonstrations or testing at no cost to the Government.  Ammunition shall be able to withstand the storage, shipping, and operational environmental extremes (Mil-Std-810)!  encountered by the US Marine Corps and US Navy with a goal of a 20-year shelf live.  In addition, the ammunition shall be able to withstand the physical environments encountered while deployed within a 76,000 lb. fully tracked amphibious vehicle or aboard a Naval surface combatant.  Company provided information shall address the ability of the ammunition design to meet safety design requirements such as Mil-Std-331, Mil-Std-1316, Mil-Std-2105, NAVSEA IM INST. 8010.5, NAVSEA INST. 8310, Mil-S-901 and Mil-Std 464.  Military Standards may be found on the Acquisition Streamlining and Standardization Information System web page (http://astimage.daps.dla.mil).  Companies submitting designs shall also identify required software and hardware associated with their ammunition.  Companies submitting designs shall be willing to enter into Non-Disclosure agreements with General Dynamics Amphibious Systems and ATK Gun Systems for any collateral systems changes that may be required to the!  MK46 Weapon System and the MK44 Automatic Cannon in order to effectively incorporate proposed ammunition.  Comments on specific requirements influencing cost and/or increased capability are encouraged.  Domestic companies submitting designs shall be willing to apply for the Defense Acquisition Challenge Program (DACP).

SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 
DESC: This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) synopsis.  Information obtained as a result of this synopsis is for planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an invitation for sealed bid or request for proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.  The government is currently conducting a market survey and analysis of commercial-off-the shelf videophone products that can provide real-time voice and video capabilities over the Public Switched Telephone Network and the DoD’s Defense Switched Network (DSN).  These videophones are to be used for morale purposes allowing deployed troops to talk to loved ones back home.

Specifically, the request is for H.324 standard videophones.  Vendors identifying products must be willing to consider participating with AFCA/ENN in certification testing at the DoD’s Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.  Vendor products must go through the Information Assurance accreditation process before they can be used on the DoD system.  These certifications are required by Public Law 107-314 for phones that operate on the DSN. 

At a minimum the vendor’s RFI submissions should answer the following questions:
1.	How does the vendor’s product meet the requirement for real-time voice and video transmission?
2.	Is the product H.324 compliant?
3.	Is the vendor a GSA schedule holder?
4.	Is the vendor willing to participate in JITC Interoperability Certification and Information Assurance Accreditation testing? 
5.	Does the proposed product rely on any proprietary standards to meet any of the requirements?
6.	Is the capability easy to deploy, maintain, learn and use?
7.	What kind of training is available for the maintainers?  On-line/CBTs, classroom, on/off-site, etc.?
8.	What type of connectivity (media, protocols, etc.) is supported/required?  What are the device’s data rates?
9.	What other vendors are partnered with and support the proposed product?

Vendors who choose to respond to this RFI and can make information and products available to the Air Force are requested to respond within 30 days after the posting date of this notice.  Potential vendors may express interest, make comments, and ask questions via electronic mail or fax comments or questions to the Air Force Communications Agency, Terrestrial Networks Engineering at AFCA.ENNT@scott.af.mil, FAX (618) 229-5544.  Vendors meeting Air Force requirements may be asked to demonstrate, at no cost to the government, capabilities for Air Force testing/review.  All comments and questions must be in writing and must identify the company source, contact person, e-mail address, and telephone number.

<CONTACT>Tandee Carr, 410-436-4398
<DESC>The Department of Defense is requesting information and seeking sources regarding standoff detection technologies capable of performing post-decontamination verfication on surfaces.  Surface Detection/Post-decontamination (SurfacePD) is the process u sed to insure that contaminant levels are within suitable safety levels after decontamination.  Any technology used to perform SurfacePD would have to be capable of detecting, identifying, locating, and quantifying very low concentration of chemical warfar e agents on and/or absorbed into surfaces.  The technology presented should be high-sensitivity, non-contact, and requires no collection. Expendables related to the detection process should be minimized. Scanning and imaging techniques are acceptable.  Sug gested application will include, but is not limited by, decontamination verification of CARC painted items, electronic components, clothing, and skin; however one technology does not necessarily have to address all the applications. Desired specifications include, but are not restricted to or limited by, the following parameters (current goal/desired goal): Agents: VX, thickened HD and GD/All agents that pose a persistent chemical threat. Substrates: Equipment, Sensitive Equipment, Personnel/same. Sensitivi ty: ED50 assuming 1-square-meter exposure/ED50/10. Range: 0.01-meter/1 meter. Response time: 1-square-meter in 5 minutes. Size: Not applicable at this state/0.1-cubic-meter. Weight: No applicable at this stage/26 lbs. Note: ED50 values may be found in FM 3 -11.9 Potential Military Chemical/Biological Agents and Compounds, January 2005. (https://atiam.train.army.mil/soldier/Portal/atia/adlsc/view/public/9655-/FM/3-11.9/TOCH.HTM) Note: Sensitivities are not indicative of proposed decontamination limits, which are based on the Worker Population Limit and the General Poplulation Limit.  The WPL and GPL are defined by Summary of Chemical Agent Air Exposure Values, OSHA, 23 December 2004 (http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/emergencypreparedness/guides/nerve_cwa_air_table_080 32004.pdf) This is a sources sought notice for planning purposes only.  This is not a solicitation and does not obligate the Government to issue a solicitation.  Any interested parties must submit concise information showing a superior understanding of the  fundamental problems and tehnological solutions.  Submissions must not exceed fifteen (15) pages. The paper should include a detailed description of the technology, any material, (theoretical data, experimental data, and modeling results) that supports it s use in this application, background information that shows maturity of system for this and/or other applications, and an indication of hardware availabillity for further testing.  Interested parties should respond by 21 July 2005 to Ms. Tandee Carr, Cont ract Specialist, at Tandee.Carr@us.army.mil.  Responses should include the interested source company's name, complete address, CAGE code, size of business (large/small) and a technical point of contact with phone number and email address.  Any information submitted by respondents to this survey is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this sources sought survey.

Title:  	Microfluidic Platform of Arrayed Switchable Spin-Valve Elements for High-Throughput Sorting and Manipulation of Magetic Particles and Biomelecules

Description:  	The invention presents a microfluidic platform that incorporates an array of spin-valve elements to selectively trap, manipulate and release magnetic particles with high throughput and specificity.  The array of spin-valve elements can exist in a ferromagnetic “on” state, thereby acting like mini bar magnets with local magnetic fields.  The magnetic field gradients provide the trapping field to confine the magnetic particles.  The spin-valve element can be turned to the antiferromagnetic “off” state where they no longer produce a local magnetic field.  In the absence of the local magnetic field, the magnetic particles are released from the trap.  The platform consists of a membrane that can separate the traps from the magnetic particle fluid, or it is possible to have the magnetic particle fluid on the same side of the traps.  The “on/off” magnetic characteristic of these elements make it possible to apply an external global magnetic field to rotate the magnetic particles while they are confined by the spin-valve elements.

<DESC>The Monitor National Marine Sanctuary, Newport News, Virginia has a requirement for  the following equipment:   A Remotely Operated Vehicle in accordance with the following Statement of Work:

I. INTRODUCTION

The vendor shall provide a small, lightweight, remotely operated vehicle (ROV) for the purpose of discovery, documentation, and management of submerged cultural resources.  The vendor shall supply an ROV that may be deployed by a single person.  The vendor shall also provide an integrated control console fitted with the power supply, video screen, and hand controller, 150 meters of umbilical cable less than 8mm diameter, and two on-board video cameras (see Section II: Specific Requirements). Archaeologists within NOAA’s Maritime Heritage Program will operate the ROV.  The precise geographic location of the ROV surveys is to be determined by the Maritime Heritage Program after the award.

NOAA’s Maritime Heritage Program (MHP), created in 2002, is an initiative of the National Marine Sanctuary Program. The MHP’s mission is to develop and implement a program of discovery, protection, management, interpretation, education, and community appreciation of our nation’s maritime heritage through partnerships with federal and state agencies, academia, and private enterprises.  The MHP focuses on maritime heritage resources within the National Marine Sanctuaries, but also promotes its goals throughout the entire nation.

II. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

The vendor shall provide a small ROV for the purpose of discovery, documentation, and management of submerged cultural resources. 

The ROV is required to be one-person-deployable and weigh no more than 30-40 lbs. in air.  To be used on small boats and operated by a single individual, the ROV’s body dimensions must be no more than 550mm long, 300mm wide, and 300mm high.  The ROV will be operated in a diverse set of depths and environments and therefore must be able to function to a maximum working depth of at least 150-meters. For site investigations and cultural resource documentation purposes the ROV is required to have two video cameras.  The first video camera is required to be color with at least 570 lines of horizontal resolution and a Lux level of at least 0.3.  The color video camera must have a tilt range of 180 degrees and have at least a 270 degrees range of view.  The color camera is required to have a 50 watt (min.) quartz halogen light with variable intensity that is capable of tracking the camera.  The second video camera is required to be black and white with at least 430 lines of horizontal resolution and a Lux level of approximately 0.03 for low light site investigations. The video output for both cameras must be NTSC.  The vendor is required to provide an integrated control console that operates on a maximum of 650-800 watts with video monitor in a waterproof case.  The control console must also incorporate an integrated hand controller with joystick that controls the ROV’s forward, reverse, rotate, and lateral movements as well as additional controls for vertical thrusters, thruster gain, trim, auto heading, auto depth, camera tilt, camera focus, lights on/off, light intensity, video overlay, and accessories.  The vendor is required to supply an ROV with brushless thrusters.  Each brushless thruster must at a minimum have a Bollard thrust of 8-9 lbs. each, and the ROV must be capable of a  forward momentum of  at least 3 knots to operate in strong currents, such as those found at the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary. The vendor is also required to supply one spare brushless thruster.  The vendor will supply an external lighting system to be mounted on the ROV to provide light when investigating the interior of shipwrecks, or in poor visibility environments.  In order to operate the vehicle in strong current and to avoid an undue amount of in-water drag the vendor is required to provide a 150-meter umbilical with a diameter of no more than 8mm.  The umbilical is required to be neutrally weighted in fresh water and weigh no more than 15-20 lbs. in the air. The vendor is required to provide an umbilical reel for the 150-meter umbilical cable.  The umbilical reel must be fitted with a 3 conductor slip ring housed in a weather proof housing. The vendor shall provide a laser scaling system with the ROV to aid in estimating the size of submerged cultural resources.  The laser scaling system must incorporate at least two lasers fitted on the color camera set at a separation of 50mm.  The lasers must be able to be turned on and off at the hand controller.

The vendor shall also provide a scanning sonar and software for long range image capture and low visibility image capture to locate targets, range to object and object avoidance, as well as for navigation.  The scanning sonar must have a minimum range of 80 meters and a 360 degree field of view.  The vendor shall provide software with the following features: 
	a. Scan sector setup 
	b. Scan speed
	c. Zoom
	d. Recording of image 
	e. Image measurement

 
III. DELIVERABLES

The vendor shall provide a one-person-deployable (maximum 30-40 lbs.) remotely operated vehicle (ROV). The ROV is required to operate to a maximum depth of 150- meters with at least 150 meters of 8mm (maximum) diameter umbilical cable and come with an integrated control console and video screen. The ROV shall be used in surveys to document cultural resources on the seafloor in both shallow and deep water. 

Detailed specifications for this ROV will be found in Section II above.

IV. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED MATERIALS

There will be no government furnished materials.

The following is a quote from their website answering the question of using other brand name equipment. The only equipment approved-tested for TAS is on the AIT equipment list. Your equipment might possibly work with TAS, but cannot be supported by SSG. If this equipment malfunctions, you will have to contact the product vendor for any trouble-shooting and will cost you valuable turn-around time.   The equipment the customer is requesting is from the AIT equipment listing. The HQ SSG Program Management Office states that the Zebra Z4M printer and Symbol P370 and 8146 XScale scanners are the only tested and approved items for the TAS program.  Additionally, these are the only products that HQ SSG PMO will provide technical support for should we encounter malfunctions.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-04. 

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses.  Only interested small businesses may submit a quote. ***

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for one (1) each, Integrated Variable Angle Spectroscopic Ellipsometer and FTIR Spectrometer to be used in the Polymers Division at NIST in Gaithersburg, Maryland. ***
 
***All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line items:  Line Item 0001: The Contractor shall furnish one (1) each, Integrated Variable Angle Spectroscopic Ellipsometer and FTIR Spectrometer.  


BACKGROUND

A turn-key, stand-alone FTIR spectrometer and variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer using radiation in the infrared (IR) range, within a single instrument configuration, is needed for the non-destructive characterization and measurement of the thickness, index of refraction, absorption coefficients, optical anisotropy, and chemical composition of thin organic films for applications in organic electronics and photolithography.  The ellipsometer is needed to provide depth profile information but is usually configured with visible light or near IR region where very limited chemical information can be obtained.  A typical FTIR instrument is appropriate for composition identification but fails to provide depth information, especially for multi-layer samples.  IR wavelengths are needed to provide chemical specificity needed to probe details in organic electronics and photoresist thin films. ***

***System shall be capable of all of the following:

(1) Cover a spectral range: 400 cm to the negative first power to 5000 cm to the negative first power with a resolution between (1 to 10) cm to the negative first power; (2) A beam spot size of less than 1 cm diameter at the sample; (3) Shall be able to accommodate samples with a diameter up to 200 mm and a substrate thickness up to 25 mm; (4) The angle of incidence shall be computer controlled over a range of (35 to 90) degrees with a precision of at least 0.005 degrees; (5) Include separate, but integrated instrumentation and capability for transmission FTIR measurements.  Within the same base equipment, both VASE and transmission FTIR measurements shall be able to be performed separately; (6) The FTIR module shall be able to accept and use standard FTIR accessories such as ATR cells, heated cells, controlled atmosphere, etc.; (7) Two detectors are needed, one dedicated for the VASE and the other dedicated for the FTIR configuration.  The detectors may be DTGS detectors with the option for modular replacement with an MCT detector for enhanced sensitivity; Specifications specific to variable angle ellipsometry application include (8) Capable of measuring the sign of delta and the off-diagonal (sp and ps) elements of the generalized Jones matrix for ‘straight through’ measurements (1 standard deviation, averaged over entire range of (5000 to 400) cm to the negative first power of Tan(psi)=1 +/- 0.005; Cos(delta)=1+/-0.0002 (9) Flexible ellipsometry analysis software that is integrated with the data acquisition software.  The software shall be capable of numerical fits to the data with an efficient convergent algorithm, incorporating multiple dispersion models, particularly for thin organic films, vertical profiling, analysis for different measurement configurations (transmission, reflection, ellipsometry, depolarization), and handle multiple sample or multiple data sets.  The analysis software shall be able to model biaxial systems, and model off diagonal (sp and ps) elements of the generalized Jones matrix.  Specifications specific to FTIR include (10) Compatibility with dry air purge for the elimination of water/ carbon dioxide features in the spectral data; (11) In a straight through configuration, collected spectral data shall have 4 cm to the negative first power resolution, 1 minute signal acquisition, and a signal to noise ratio at 2000 cm to the negative first power of 30,000 to1; (12) a minimum scan time at 4 cm to the negative first power, DTGS detector, of 3 seconds; (13) A computer shall be provided to operate and control the instrument as well as run the data analysis software; (14) On-site instrument installation and training shall be provided.  On-site installation shall include uncrating and assembling the equipment so that the equipment is operational and that infrared spectroscopic ellipsometric measurement can be taken on thin film materials.  NIST shall be responsible for the availability of any needed utilities for the instrument.  During the on-site installation, one day of training at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD in the operation of the equipment and software shall be provided for up to 3 people.

H92239-05-T-0035

61” and 84” PLASMAS & ACCESSORIES


Question 1.  I have a question concerning the 84” plasma specifications on the RFQ H92239-05-T-0035. The specification reads for an NEC 84VP5A plasma with except for two items. The first item is the seamless virtue. These screens are really four individual plasmas that act as one, but have 1.5 edged frames. The other question is that while these monitors come a static mount a tilt mount would be applicable to each individual screen. We have an 84 plasma screen available that meets the seamless aspect better and has a mount but doesn’t’ have all the specified inputs like the NEC specification. To the best of my knowledge these are the two items currently available. All others are prototypes.  Is there a priority?


Answer 1.   In reference to the seamless virtue it is like the ORION PK-8401 has with a 3MM seam. We are looking for a Display that has the ability to project four screens in the 84” area and has the smallest seam. The ORION had the 3mm seam and was virtually unseen. It allowed us to split the screen into four display areas. We could display from 4 different feeds to these display areas. Thus by having three screens mounted we could monitor 12 displays. The tilt mount we were trying to get allowed the entire 84” screen to be tilted, if each screen like in the NEC example was tilted separately the gap would increase beyond the 1.5 gap.   Is that 1.5 inches or mm, big difference in the seam if it is inches.


Question 2.  We are interested in bidding on the plasma screen solicitation, what kind of drawings are you requesting along with our bid?

Answer 2.  Drawings of the plasma screens you are providing.

PRINCIPLE STATEMENT OF WORK

(1) The contractor shall provide an overall conceptual engineering design of a research wind tunnel to meet the specifications given.  The contractor shall provide a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) to the AF. Following the PDR, and with AF approval, the contractor shall proceed and complete the design that includes all construction details and notes on drawings.  Upon successful completion of the PDR, the contractor shall submit final engineering drawings to the AF for approval and authorization to proceed (ATP).  The design must comply with all applicable State Codes, City Ordinances, Factory Mutual Insurance Company requirements, and all agencies having jurisdiction over this job.  Any required permits are the responsibility of the contractor.

(2) The contractor shall design and manufacture a research wind tunnel to AF specifications.  The contractor shall provide bi-weekly status reports to the AF focal point and allow AF representatives to visit the contractor at any time to review the design and/or inspect the wind tunnel during its manufacture.  Upon completion of the wind tunnel fabrication, the contractor shall provide as-built drawings.  Bidders shall specify whether an operational checkout at the manufacturing site will be performed.  The contractor shall also provide a written summary of the operational checkout of the wind tunnel (if performed).  The AF or a designated representative will perform a buyoff inspection at the contractor’s location prior to shipping.  On AF approval, the contractor shall package and ship the wind tunnel to the installation site in Pomona, California.

(3) The contractor shall install a Northrop Grumman (NG)-type designed model support system onto the new wind tunnel.  The model support system, seen in the Concept Support Picture at http://www.csupomona.edu/~aro/wt/, will be constructed under a separate contract and provided to the wind tunnel contractor for installation. The contractor shall mount the model support hardware below the test section.  This system includes a strut that extends up into the test section for mounting test models.  It provides pitch and yaw control of the model.  An Interface Control Drawing (ICD) is shown in the Concept Support Picture at http://www.csupomona.edu/~aro/wt/.  It shows the model support hardware installation in the wind tunnel test section.  A NG-designed slotted turntable (45 inch diameter, 1/4 inch thick aluminum disk) will be installed into a circular cutout in the floor of the test section, flush with the tunnel’s floor surface.  The disk turns with the support system for yaw control.  The strut extends through the slotted disk and pivots to give pitch control.  The support system must be positioned and leveled (with respect to the tunnel centerline when installed) so that the center of rotation of the support system coincides with the center of the test section.

(4) The contractor shall install a base to locate the support system vertically.  The base will be attached to the floor below the test section and the support system will be mounted on top of three adjustable leveling feet.  Dimensions of the base are approximately 38 inches wide by 55 inches long by 12 inches high. (The height of the base is dependent upon the distance from the floor to the test section centerline.)  An existing base design is available from NG and will be modified and constructed by another vendor and supplied to the wind tunnel vendor for installation under the test section.

(5) The contractor shall perform functional tests of the new wind tunnel to verify that all specifications are met and make all adjustments or corrections, as required to achieve operation and test section airflow quality within the specification.  Any negative deviation from the specifications must be approved by the AF. To verify the flow quality, the contractor shall perform a detailed calibration of the airflow in the test section of the installed wind tunnel.  This would include two-dimensional mappings (every 2” in the y and z directions normal to the flow direction) of flow velocity, flow angularity in pitch and yaw, and turbulence intensity at 3 (streamwise) stations along the test section: the center of the test section and two other longitudinal stations +/-20” from the first.

(6) The contractor shall provide calibration data to correlate control panel speed setting to test section air velocity for clear test section.

(7) The contractor shall provide a training session for the AF and CPP personnel.  Topics include facility operation, maintenance, servicing, precautions, etc.

(8) The contractor shall provide two complete sets of documentation describing the operation and maintenance of the wind tunnel and all support equipment.

(9) The contractor shall provide printed engineering drawings, 2-D and 3-D in AutoCAD, of the as-built wind tunnel facility on E-size drawings (28” x 40”) and electronic drawing files on CD-ROM.  Electronic drawing files shall be provided in both .pdf format as well as AutoCAD or IGES format.

OPTIONAL STATEMENT OF WORK

Contractors shall perform the following tasks that consist of enhancements to the principal statement of work.  

(1) The contractor shall utilize a chilled water line that passes by the wind tunnel site.  The contractor will provide a heat exchanger and a (water) tank in lieu of a water cooling tower.  The contractor shall size the system to maintain wind tunnel temperature at ambient +/- 5 degrees F.  Local ambient temperatures range from 50 to 105 degrees F.  It is anticipated that, without cooling, flow temperature will rise by 25 degrees F above ambient during a typical run.  The contractor shall install the tower at an AF approved location near the wind tunnel, make all required hookups (electrical, water, etc.), check out operation and obtain all of the required permits.  

(2) Improve flow quality in the test section from those specified in above (Principle Statement of Work) to - Flow uniformity:  0.25% variation from average velocity or less; Turbulence:  0.07% turbulence intensity or less; Flow angularity:  *0.1 degree variation or less in pitch and yaw (clear test section).

These are maximum values allowed at the array of points specified in the flow calibration of the test section described in the principle statement of work.

To achieve this improved flow quality, it is recommended that Items a - c below be considered.

(a) The contractor shall add two additional screens, after the honeycomb and before the contraction cone to improve flow uniformity in the test section.

(b) The contractor shall add a constant section, of length equal to one effective diameter of the tunnel at that location, between turn 4 and the contraction cone to improve flow quality in the test section, if you add this constant section, the wind tunnel length should not exceed 62’.

(c) The contractor shall add corner fillets to all four corners of the test section, with proper fairings upstream and downstream of the test section, to improve flow quality in the test section. Fillets are to be such as to account for growth of the boundary layers on the walls of the test section. Therefore, the test section walls shall be parallel, in pairs.

(3) The contractor shall install lights in the test section fillets, 4 places, to improve lighting in the test section.

(4) The contractor shall provide and install noise reduction equipment (acoustic silencers) inside the wind tunnel to reduce the level of wind tunnel noise. The contractor shall specify the noise level reduction provided by the silencers (dBA) at 100, 200 and 300 ft/sec.

(5) The contractor shall provide automatic controls of wind tunnel parameters including dynamic pressure (q), temperature, model pitch, and model yaw.  Analog voltages will be available from the model support system for pitch and yaw.  The AF will provide the needed programming in LabVIEW.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The Government of Macedonia (GOM) is in the process of liberalizing and privatizing its energy sector.  While the opportunities with the state-owned entity in Macedonia are limited until the GOM completes its restructuring and privatization plans, there are other opportunities in developing the private sector and developing alternative fuel sources.   Specifically, the GOM has been looking at ways to utilize waste from the agriculture sector, like grape seeds, and converting it to bio-diesel fuel that can be sold on the European market.  The DM consultant would need to evaluate the following: (1) the amount of agriculture waste product available; (2) how much waste is required to produce bio-diesel to make the venture profitable; (3) the financial capability to build the facilities; and (4) where the facilities would be located.

The new Romanian Government elected in December 2004 is committed to continuing the progress and policies set forth by the previous government aimed at developing a market economy for the energy sector.  The government is maintaining a far-reaching economic reform program for the sector.  The reform package focuses on eliminating price controls, freeing the exchange rate, eliminating subsidies, allowing bank privatization, encouraging foreign investment, and speeding up industry restructuring and privatization to meet higher European Union (EU) regulations.  As a result of these reforms, several of the leading Romanian oil, gas and power generation and distribution companies have sought assistance from USTDA to comply with Romania’s new legislation and to prepare to meet EU standards.  

Romanian energy companies are eager to comply with the new regulations and are consistently striving to improve the efficiency of their operations to compete in the open energy market.  

The following proposals have been submitted to USTDA for funding consideration in Romania:
§	Environmental upgrade and emissions control equipment for the combined heat and power plant in Arad
§	Rehabilitation and modernization of the Focsani Combined Heat and Power Plant

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the following provisions shall govern the delivery of goods and services funded by USTDA under this Grant Agreement: (a) for professional services, the Contractor must be either a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant; (b) the Contractor may use U.S. subcontractors without limitation, but the use of subcontractors from host country may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount and may only be used for specific services from the Terms of Reference identified in the subcontract; (c) employees of U.S. Contractor or U.S. subcontractor firms responsible for professional services shall be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.; (d) goods purchased for implementation of the Study and associated delivery services (e.g., international transportation and insurance) must have their nationality, source and origin in the United States; and (e) goods and services incidental to Study support (e.g., lodging, food, and transportation) in host country are not subject to the above restrictions. USTDA will make available further details concerning these standards of eligibility upon request.

NATIONALITY:
1.	Rule

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the Contractor for USTDA funded activities must be either a U.S. firm or a U.S. consultant. Prime contractors may utilize U.S. subcontractors, but the use of host country subcontractors is limited to 20% of the USTDA grant amount.
2.	Application

Accordingly, only a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant may submit proposals on USTDA-funded activities. Although those proposals may include subcontracting arrangements with host country firms or individuals for up to 20% of the USTDA grant amount, they may not include subcontracts with third country entities. U.S. firms submitting proposals must ensure that the professional services funded by the USTDA grant, to the extent not subcontracted to host country entities, are supplied by employees of the firm or employees of U.S. subcontractor firms who are U.S. individuals. 

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant. 
3.	Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

A "U.S. consultant" is (a) a U.S. citizen whose principal place of business is in the United States, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder) whose principal place of business is in the U.S.

A "U.S. firm" is a privately owned firm which is incorporated in the U.S., with its principal place of business in the U.S., and which is either (a) more than 50% owned by U.S. individuals, or (b) has been incorporated in the U.S. for more than three (3) years prior to the issuance date of the request for proposals; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question. 

A partnership, organized in the U.S. with its principal place of business in the U.S., may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" as would a joint venture organized or incorporated in the United States consisting entirely of U.S. firms and/or U.S. individuals.

A nonprofit organization, such as an educational institution, foundation, or association may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" if it is incorporated in the United States and managed by a governing body, a majority of whose members are U.S. individuals.
SOURCE AND ORIGIN:
1.	Rule

In addition to the nationality requirement stated above, any goods (e.g., equipment and materials) and services related to their shipment (e.g., international transportation and insurance) funded under the USA Grant Agreement must have their source and origin in the United States, unless USTDA otherwise agrees. However, necessary purchases of goods and project support services which, are unavailable from a U.S. source (e.g., local food, housing and transportation) are eligible without specific USTDA approval.
2.	Application

Accordingly, the prime contractor must be able to demonstrate that all goods and services purchased in the host country to carry out the Terms of Reference for a USTDA Grant Agreement that were not of U.S. source and origin were unavailable in the United States. 
3.	Definitions

"Source" means the country from which shipment is made.

"Origin" means the place of production, through manufacturing, assembly or otherwise.
Questions regarding these nationality, source and origin requirements may be addressed to the USTDA Office of General Counsel by calling (703) 875-4357.
