<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;;">The USDA, Agricultural Research
Service (ARS), intends to negotiate solely with Illumina, Inc., in San Diego,
California to custom design a 10,000 SNP Genotyping array for non-human
species; specifically, a representative sample of the grapevine Germplasm
repository of the USDA.<span>&nbsp; </span>The purpose of
collecting genome-wide SNP data from the entire grape germplasm repository is
to establish a core collection for the repository.<span>&nbsp; </span>A core collection is a subset of the entire
repository that is as representative as possible of the entire genetic
diversity present in the repository.<span>&nbsp; </span>The
establishment of a core collection is a crucial first step towards association
genetics and will provide the foundation for future studies that aim to
identify genetic variants responsible for agronomically important traits. In
addition these data can be used to assess numerous questions concerning the
origins, domestication and dispersal of the grapevine.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sole Source Justification &ndash; Illumina, Inc. shall:
1) produce a microarray for the grape, a non-model species; 2) The Genotyping
microarray must be custom-designable since there is currently no commercially
available genome-wide SNP microarray for the grapevine; 3) Produce a microarray
with a minimum of 10,000 features (i.e., SNPs) to a maximum of more than
100,000 SNPs discovered by sequencing; 4) Supply all reagents and test kits
necessary for the microarrays; 5) The microarray must be compatible with the
existing equipment in use by the Government and includes Affymetrix GeneChip
Instrument System and Illumina Bead Station 500; 6) Delivery shall be within
ten (10) weeks after receipt of SNP information; 7) Custom designed genotyping
arrays that contain fewer than 10,000 features cannot be read by either the
Affymetrix or Illumina Systems (identified above), or are not designed
specifically for use with grape DNA will be excluded from consideration. <span>&nbsp;</span>A) The Government shall: 1)Provide data
containing SNP information in a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet.<span>&nbsp; </span>The spreadsheet will be delivered by email
within 100 days of contract award; 2) Provide Notification to the Contractor if
microarrays are found to be faulty.<span>&nbsp; </span>This
notification must be provided within on calendar year from the date the
microarrays are received by the Government; 3) Provide Government-owned property
which includes an Affymetrix GeneChip Instrument System and an Illumina Bead
Station 500; 4) Provide a federal express number for shipping of this product
after award; B) The Contractor shall: 1) Provide approximately 2,304 custom
designed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 10K genotyping arrays; <span>&nbsp;</span>2) Provide the complete quantity of SNP arrays
must all fit into a space not greater than one-third of a -80 freezer (4 ft. x
4 ft. x 2 ft.); 3) Provide the genotyping arrays which are capable of being
read by either an Affymetrix GeneChip Instrument System or an Illumina Bead
Station 500; 4) Notify the Government by email if the SNP data (provided by the
Government in an Excel spreadsheet) fails, within five (5) business days of the
failure; 5)Provide documentation of the use of the SNP arrays which must
include a description of the design of the product and detailed instruction for
a lab technician to process the microarrays; 6) Replacement of microarrays if
the initial shipment was found to contain faulty microarrays. The replacement
microarrays must be shipped within 30 days of notification (refer to A.2
above); 7) provide a warranty for at least a one-year period from the date of

<DESC>Reference No 08-38

a) The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) plans to award a sole source contract to The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) for Space Control analysis, from 1 October 2008 to 31 October 2010 (2 years), with a possibility of eight additional 1-year options.  Approximate value is estimated at $3M per year.

b) The intent is to award a contract to maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational institution, JHU/APL.  JHU/APL’s core competencies include (but are not limited to) designing, development, and prototyping of space systems; analysis and evaluation of space systems and space-related date; and research and development of systems that provide characterization of the space environment, situational awareness, accurate discrimination, and targeting of threat objects.

c) As a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC), JHU/APL shall assist SMC/SYSW (and STRATCOM, AFSPC, and similar agencies) with the technical assessments, systems & program integration, and strategy & concepts development supporting the Space Control mission area.   Further, the fundamental application of this UARC expertise will be to establish concepts for maintaining US mission capability in the face of varied threats by leveraging all space, air, terrestrial, and cyber elements that can be integrated into a solution. Aspects of this effort will include projecting and red-teaming possible threats, developing mitigation across all domains and across all applicable systems with the specific goal of identifying weaknesses in current mission sustainment that result from stovepiping.

d) This contract will support the analysis of systems, capabilities, and concepts within the Space Control mission areas of Defensive Counterspace (DCS), Space Situation Awareness (SSA), and space Command and Control (C2).  This contract will ensure maximum leverage of developed capabilities, consistency in assessment approach, long-term continuity, and short-term responsiveness to requirements for critical analysis that refines and expands upon work performed to date by APL.  In addition to program support via papers and studies, ongoing support includes the development of an “end-to-end” ISSA system modeling and simulation capability. This contract will permit the Government to efficiently ensure the mission areas are fully integrated and there is sufficient continuity with one contractor for the Government to realize maximum benefits.

e) The Government needs to maintain analysis consistent with the current approach without interruption and substantial duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through competition.  The current analysis approach includes developing and maintaining a Concept Development Testing Environment (CDTE) that provides for Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)-free access for industry contractors to demonstrate and test potential new DCS and SSA products.  APL’s structure provides for a relatively OCI-free environment, critical to handling proprietary data.

f) Space Protection Program (SPP) – JHU/APL shall assist SMC/SYSW (and STRATCOM, AFSPC, and similar agencies) with technical assessments, systems & program integration, and strategy & concepts on the emerging space protection mission area.  Provide Subject Matter Experts for requirements and capabilities studies, intelligence and physical analysis of vulnerabilities (attack modalities) of spacecraft systems, sensors, and ground systems, as well as cyberspace and information assurance domains. Provide threat characterization, assessment of vulnerabilities due to technology advancements, and development of countermeasures may include signature characterization, signature and detectability models, developing operational guidance, and prototyping systems, technologies, or TTPs.

g) Simulation and Modeling – JHU/APL shall provide simulation and modeling of selected concept designs across all disciplines of space systems. This includes space phenomenology, cyberspace, threat analysis/effects, space segment performance, operations, ground segment interfaces, terrestrial systems and their implications, cross-mission CONOPS, and enterprise-wide mission capability sustainment to include US government assets, civil/commercial assets, and foreign assets.

h) All interested parties can submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC) no longer than 10 pages and containing the following information: technical description of the offeror’s experience and knowledge of Air Force Space Command space control systems, Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and architecture; description of facilities and equipment intended for use in support of this effort; proof of security clearances for government evaluation; and their OCI strategy to maintain an OCI-free environment.  In addition, they shall include their plan to insure separation of contractor’s proprietary data.  Interested parties must have experience with analysis of Air Force Space Command military systems and capabilities, to include development of analysis software and tools, and must have detailed knowledge of Air Force Space Command space control systems, capabilities, and their operations across all mission areas (DCS/SSA/C2).  They must also have knowledge of the intelligence community processes, systems, capabilities, operations.    To mitigate schedule risks, interested parties must have strong experience with ongoing efforts and developments in space control and must be ready to initiate or continue analysis and products immediately upon contract award.  

i) All interested parties must be cleared to handle government equipment and information up to, and including TS/SCI/SAR and have personnel with current TS/SSBIs as well as a Top Secret - SCI accredited SCIF.  SOCs should be sent to SYSW/PK, Attn: David Kessler, 483 North Aviation Blvd. El Segundo, CA 90245-2808 or e-mailed to david.kessler.ctr@losangeles.af.mil and received by 4:00 P.M, PST, on 21 July 2008.  Submittals that contain classified materials must be coordinated with either the primary or secondary points of contact.  No contract award will be made on the basis of SOCs received in response to this notice.  The NAICS code for this announcement is 541712 with the applicable size standard of 1,000 employees.  Any business in this area of expertise will be allowed to participate in the submittal of SOC’s.  Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.  However, all businesses must be capable to support operations pertaining to the description of services at the time of submitting SOC’s.  

BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this proposed acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this proposed acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of SOCs for this proposed acquisition. The Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill, phone number (310) 653-1789.  Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the primary or secondary POCs (See 5. or 6. above for contact information).

In order for the services and revenue stream to continue, it is anticipated that a new contract will be in place on or about November 1 to transition from the incumbent contractors' systems to the new contractor's system.

The PWS also includes requirements for:  (1) providing on-site ticket sales and reservations for both immediate and future tour ticket sales; (2) ensuring that pedestrian traffic at the ticket stations is routed in a safe, orderly manner that minimizes waiting time to no more than ten minutes and does not create congested areas inside the Visitor Center; (3) collecting and remitting fees for all tickets sold for the Government; (4) refunding fees in accordance with the Hoover Dam Fee Schedule and Refund Procedures; (5) providing promotional coupons, site maps and magazines, and other promotional literature authorized by the Government to visitors; and (6) preparing and distributing specified financial reports detailing financial transactions.  The tour ticket sales work is located at the Theater Level of the Hoover Dam Visitor Center.  The Visitor Center is at Hoover Dam, which is located on the Colorado River, approximately 7 miles northwest of Boulder City, Nevada and 32 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada.

<DESC><p><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a contract to the Paul Cooper, 323 9th ST NE, Washington, DC 20002-6115. Paul Cooper possesses the requisite skills and unique experiences necessary to facilitate meetings and communications of the Facilitation and Strategic Planning for the Fire Safety Council (FSC).
<p>The National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention (DUIP) participates in a partnership with the United States Fire Administration (USFA), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), and other federal and non-federal organizations known as the Fire Safety Council. Under previous contracts a FSC strategic plan was developed. However, the enormous problem of residential fires and the complexity in reducing deaths from residential fires requires that continued work needs to be done over the next three years to coordinate efforts across organizations and a modified plan needs to be produced and delivered.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, and equipment required to facilitate monthly teleconferences, quarterly meetings, and to revise strategic plans. The contractor will then present these plans to the Council's Planning Committee, revise the plans based on the Planning Committee comments and submit the plan to the full partnership.</p>
<p>Paul Cooper has experience in the complicated field of fire prevention that involves multiple disciplines and sectors including the fire services, public health researchers and practitioners, product safety and material science engineers, building code developers, housing experts, public health educators, private smoke alarm manufacturers, and non-profit advocacy groups, to name a few. Leaders from organizations that represent each of these groups participate in the FSC. While all have common goal of preventing residential fire injuries and death, each organization has it own agenda, skill-set, resource challenges, and culture, which makes it very difficult for a large group like FSC to work together seamlessly and come to consensus on issues. Paul Cooper skillfully understands these characteristics for each organization for each individual representative. Paul Cooper's participation with the FSC predates by several years the current representatives from three lead federal agencies (CDC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the US Fire Administration) . Because the FSC strives to build on past work, Paul Copper alone can provide the contract for past work, discussions and decisions.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1): FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for informational purposes. This procurement is set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Michael E. Allen by email at MEAllen@CDC.gov or by fax to 770-488-2856.</p>

PBGC's Financial Operations Department (FOD) maintains accounts for the assets and liabilities of the individual trusteed plans using three applications: Portfolio Accounting and Management (PAM®) for Securities, Trust Interface System (TIS) and the CFS Trust Plan Ledger.   PAM® is a COTS package from Princeton Financial Systems, Inc. and is used to account for specific securities owned by each plan and to capture other financial transactions such as plan expenses and benefit payments until the plan is fully commingled at PBGC's custodian bank.  PAM version 6.10 is currently installed in PBGC's production environment.  Bank statements and other source documents received from prior trustees and custodian banks are  evaluated, summarized via spreadsheets as appropriate, and manually input into PAM. Financial ledger transactions are extracted from PAM, edited and forwarded to CFS by TIS, and posted by CFS to the Trust Plan Ledger for subsequent financial statement reporting and analysis.  Plan level accounting begins well before the date PBGC becomes trustee and continues throughout the commingling process.  The time period required to commingle a plan varies and can take from a few months to over a year.  At any one time, the number of plans (i.e., active portfolios) not yet fully commingled and managed with the assistance of PAM is approximately 250 to 500.  

In addition to acquiring the license rights to use PAM® for Securities, PBGC requires under this statement of work ongoing system maintenance and help desk support to ensure that PAM is fully operational and effective in meeting FOD's requirements.  Specific activities that will be performed under this statement of work are:

&#61507;	Telephone Help Desk Support
&#61507;	Software Modifications, Updates and Enhancements
&#61507;	Correction of Documented Errors or Defects
&#61507;	Grant License to use PAM® for Securities

This is a pre-solicitation notice, not a solicitation.  The solicitation is estimated to be availabe on or about August 20, 2008.

<DESC>The NNSA/SC intends to award a sole-source contract, pursuant to FARSubpart13.5, Commercial Items Test Program, to TSA Systems, Ltd., a smallbusiness,for the purchase of ten rail radiation portal monitors and five skidmountedradiation portal monitors.  This acquisition is supported by aJustificationfor Other Than Full and Open Competition.  The proposed contract action isforequipment for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate withonlyone responsible source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only OneResponsibleSource and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.TheGovernment has purchased radiation portal monitors from TSA Systems, Ltd.Standardization of this equipment is necessary in order to reducesustainability costs as well as reduce costs of developing standard designsformultiple models, developing communications systems to interface withmultiplemodels, developing training for multiple models, and contracting formaintenance, set up and configuration services from multiple manufacturers.Astudy of historical costs of developing implementing interfaces betweencommunications systems and monitors, developing and implementing trainingfornew monitors and contracting for maintenance for multiple monitor types atasingle site indicate that the cost to the Government of utilizing equipmentfrom additional vendors at a single site is expensive.  For these reasons,itis in the best interest of the Government to purchase this equipment fromTSASystems, Ltd.  This is a notice of intent to award sole-source and is not arequest for competitive proposals.  However, firms who want to challengethesole-source intent of this purchase must submit an interest letter thatdemonstrates the firms ability to provide the equipment described above.Allinterested firms must respond to DE-AC52-08NA28993 by 3:00pm MST,Wednesday,August 13, 2008 to:  Maggie Howe, NNSA Service Center, P.O. Box 5400,Albuquerque NM, 87185-5400 or to mhowe@doeal.gov.  A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses tothisnotice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Informationreceivedwill normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whethertoconduct a competitive procurement.  No contract will be awarded on thebasis ofthe responses received from this notice, since this notice cannot beconsidereda formal solicitation document.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) intends to award on a sole source basis a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order to Virginia Tech University, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, 409 Durham Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061.  This proposed action is being procured on an unrestricted basis.  This requirement is for the development of a retail bacterial cross-contamination model for foodborne pathogens.  The following activities will be conducted:  1) A literature review and analysis of cross-contamination models appropriate for food safety; 2) In conjunction with FSIS, conduct a literature review and evaluate unpublished studies (e.g., those from industry, academia, government, and/or consumer group) of retail food handling and sanitation practices and food safety interventions for both RTE and raw food products; 3) In conjunction with FSIS, collect data and information related to various retail settings, including retail profiles, food handling practices, and sanitation practices; 4) In conjunction with FSIS, develop data needs for cross-contamination models.  Identify existing data sources and highlight data gaps and potential interventions to be considered; 5) In conjunction with FSIS, assist in the design of a large scale observational study of retail RTE food handling and sanitation practices stratified by differing retail setting (i.e., retail profile data) and in the design of a pathogen contamination (prevalence, level and subtype) study in the retail environment; 6) In conjunction with FSIS, develop appropriate cross-contamination model methodology and guidance for incorporation into risk assessment models.  Develop a working prototype cross-contamination model based on Listeria monocytogenes at retail establishments, and integrate this model with the existing FSIS (2003) in-plant model and the existing FDA/FSIS (2003) risk ranking model.  Modify these models as needed as well as incorporate the newest retail contamination (prevalence, concentration, and subtyping) data, retail food handling and storage time-temperature data, current predictive microbiological models, and retail and/or consumer food handing data available; 7) In conjunction with FSIS, characterize the impact of retail practices and/or interventions on the transmission of Listeria monocytogenes at retail, changes in contamination of FSIS-regulated products and the retail environment, and subsequent impact on public health (e.g., increase or reduction in foodborne illness); 8) In conjunction with FSIS, characterize the effectiveness of retail practices and/or interventions in terms of human health risk, including characterization of the uncertainty associated with risk estimates; and 9) In conjunction with FSIS, develop final risk assessment reports, briefings, and presentations related to the development of cross-contamination modeling methodology and the retail risk assessment evaluating retail practices and/or interventions (e.g., product separation, sanitation practices, etc.). 
In conjunction with FSIS, respond to comments from internal and independent peer reviewers on the analyses and cross-contamination model(s) developed under this contract.

Virginia Tech is the author of the work which is to be expanded in this current contract and is therefore uniquely qualified to continue the evolution of this project. Virginia Tech was involved with the collection and analysis of data, construction and coding of the original Listeria monocytogenes risk assessment model, and the original drafting and writing of the main report. Virginia Tech fully understands the construction and history behind the report and model, and has a working knowledge of all the inputs and relationships represented within the model.  They are therefore uniquely qualified to change the original model coding by developing and incorporating a new model component and new data.  Given this, they are also uniquely qualified to understand, manage, and if needed troubleshoot how such changes will affect the Listeria monocytogenes risk assessment.  

Virginia Tech is experienced in developing cross-contamination models for Listeria monocytogenes applicable to the type of model needed for a retail risk assessment.  One of their employees served as the technical lead in the development of this cross-contamination model (FSIS (2003) in-plant model) for FSIS, presenting at FSIS public meeting, to senior management and at the Interagency Risk Assessment Committee.

In addition, a Virginia Tech employee authored supporting documents, including 1) developing technical responses to external peer review panel tasked to review the draft Listeria monocytogenes risk assessment, 2) developing technical responses to public comments on the draft Listeria monocytogenes risk assessment, and 3) developing technical responses an additional set of responses to supplemental public comments.  

Virginia Tech also presented and responded to questions at the public meeting on proposed Listeria regulations (The FSIS Draft Listeria Risk Assessment, Part I, FSIS Draft Listeria Risk Assessment Technical Meeting, Washington DC, February 26, 2003).  Given that the changes to this risk assessment could have regulatory impact, Virginia Tech’s previous experience with the regulatory process will be invaluable.

This is not a request for quote.  No solicitation is available for this requirement.  Interested concerns may submit a capability statement within 15 days after the posted date of this notice.  All timely responses will be considered; however, a determination by the Government not to complete this requirement based upon the responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) intends to award on a sole source basis a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order to Virginia Tech University, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering,  409 Durham Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061.  This proposed action is being procured on a n unrestricted basis.  This requirement is for the adaptation of the Listeria Monocytogenes risk assessment to a 2 dimensional model for the development of acceptable level of protection (ALOP), food safety objective (FSO), and performance objectives (PO).  The following activities will be conducted:  1) Contractor will determine what changes are need to upgrade the 2003 FSIS Risk Assessment for Listeria monocytogenes in Deli Meats to a 2-dimensional probabilistic risk assessment model (typically a Monte Carlo assessment) sufficient to be used to estimate ALOP, FSO, and POs for Listeria monocytogenes.  The upgrade requires that the model accounts for both variability (e.g., between food servings) and uncertainty.  The Contractor will then alter the existing risk assessment and document those changes and the effect to the output of the model in a written report; 2) Contractor will recalibrate the contamination event parameters in the 2003 FSIS Risk Assessment to match the most current retail data available (Draughton, 2006); 3) Contractor will extend the 2003 FSIS Risk Assessment model to estimate Listeria monocytogenes distribution at time of consumption using the data and approach of the 2003 FDA-FSIS Relative Risk Ranking Model;
4) In discussion with FSIS, contractor will select and program a dose-response relationship suitable for Listeria monocytogenes in the selected RTE food type.  The 2003 FDA-FSIS model contains a dose-response relationship, but the approach used requires significant calibration;  
5) Using the 2003 FSIS Risk Assessment for Listeria monocytogenes in Deli Meats model, the contractor will use the method developed for C. perfringens to estimate ALOP, FSO and PO within a specific RTE product (assumed to be deli meat) according to the general specifications of the Codex Committee on Food Hygiene at the 95% and 99% confidence levels.  Alternative methods of estimating these metrics can be employed; however, changes to the previous approach shall be justified; 6) The contractor will develop a sampling plan for verifying compliance with the POs developed by the contractor and evaluate it at the 95% and 99% confidence levels; and 7) The contractor will develop a report describing the methodology, changes to the previous methodology, the technical aspects, lessons learned, and the results of this model including sensitivity and uncertainty analysis for the distribution of the expected number of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths due to consumption of contaminated deli meats with Listeria monocytogenes.  In addition, the contractor will also describe the current state of knowledge of ALOP, FSO and PO approaches.

Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University is the author of the work which is to be expanded in this current contract and is therefore uniquely qualified to continue the evolution of this project. Virginia Tech was involved with the collection and analysis of data, construction and coding of the original Listeria monocytogenes risk assessment model, and the original drafting and writing of the main report. They fully understand the construction and history behind the report and model, and has a working knowledge of all the inputs and relationships represented within the model.  They are therefore uniquely qualified to change the original model coding by developing and incorporating a new 2-D model component, new data, and changing the model to estimate ALOP, FSO and POs.  Given this, they are also uniquely qualified to understand, manage, and if needed troubleshoot how such changes will affect the Listeria monocytogenes risk assessment.

This motor is a space flightversion of an engineering motor that was originally manufactured by Aeroflex, Inc.Aeroflex was awarded the initial contract for fabricating the engineering motors throughFull and Open Competition. One of the engineering motors is part of a Life Test reactionwheel. The Life Test is necessary because the reaction wheel design (referred to as theDemiseable Integrated Reaction Wheel Assembly - DIRWA) is new and has no space flightheritage at this time. All new designs of repetitive motion devices require a Life Test.As one of the moving parts in the DIRWA, the motor is a critical component. Using adifferent motor from a different manufacturer would invalidate the Life Test, which beganrunning in April 2007.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Particular emphasis has been
placed on understanding signal transduction pathways mediated by the activation
of G protein-coupled receptors and growth factors receptors.<span>&nbsp; </span>Studies include the understanding of paracrine,
autocrine, and juxatocrine activation of growth factor receptors, activation of
T-cell receptors, chemotaxis, and the identification and analysis of effector
and adaptor molecules that control proliferation, differentiation, and motility
through these different pathways.<span>&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
understanding the signal transduction pathways and identifying the proteins
involved in chemotaxis will lead to greater understanding of both the immune

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Accurate and quantitative
measurement of chemotaxis is essential to adequately compare the behavior of
various mutant cell types as well as assess the effect of inhibitors. This
requires a system that not only provides reproducible linear chemoattractant
gradients, but also provides software to extract quantitative information from
the collected data. The EZ-TAxiscan is the only instrument available on the
market that allows quantitative analyses of chemotaxis. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The EZ-Taxiscan is a small
microscope that is enclosed in a desktop-size box that allows the user to
directly observe the movement of cells during chemotaxis. It contains a movable
stage and a high-end microfluidic device that allows the generation of shallow,
linear chemoattractant gradients. Most importantly, it is designed to analyze
six samples at a time &ndash; an invaluable benefit. It contains a thermal control
unit and comes with an impressive and user-friendly quantitative analysis
software. This six channel device is easy to use and designed to meet the needs
of small-scale chemotactic research. The migration of cells is filmed with a
CCD camera located beneath the chip, equipped with a high performance lens and
coaxial episcopic illumination system. Images are taken at time-lapse intervals
and saved digitally. </span></p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:kevin.bassler@us.army.mil">RDECOM Acquisition Center - Research Triangle Park</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, RTP Contracting Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, is issuing a DRAFT Program Announcement (PA), W911NF-08-R-0014, for the Cognition and Neuroergonomics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CAN CTA).  The purpose of the United States Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Cognition and Neuroergonomics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CAN CTA) Program Announcement (PA) is to solicit offers to establish a new Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA) in the area of Cognition and Neuroergonomics.  The DRAFT CAN CTA PA can be found at http://www.arl.army.mil/cogn-neuroerg.   The Army envisions that the Alliance will bring together government, industrial and academic institutions to address research and development to enable optimal Soldier-system performance during tactical operations.  The objective of the Alliance is the development and demonstration of fundamental translational principles, that is, principles governing the application of neuroscience-based research and theory to complex operational settings. The Alliance is expected to perform enabling research and to transition technology to enhance Soldier-system performance in complex operational settings by optimizing information transfer between the system and the Soldier, identifying mental processes and individual differences that impact mission-relevant decision making, and developing technologies for individualized analyses of neurally-based processing in operational environments. To achieve this objective the Alliance is expected to implement computational modeling and to execute and link neuroscience-based research from multiple levels to produce advances in fundamental science and technology, demonstrate and transition technology, and develop research demonstrators for Warfighter experimentation.  This PA will result in the award of two instruments:  (1) a cooperative agreement as defined at 31 U.S.C. 6305 for the execution of the Fundamental Research Component; and (2) a procurement contract as defined in 31 U.S.C. 6303 for the execution of the Technology Transition Component.  The cooperative agreement for the Fundamental Research Component will be awarded to a Consortium consisting of a Lead of the Consortium and other Members as necessary and appropriate to fulfill the goals of the CAN CTA Program. At least 70% of Fundamental Research Component funds go to academic institutions and at least 10% of the total funding provided for academic institutions must be provided to HBCU/MI Member(s).  The Lead of the Consortium may be an academic or industrial concern.  The procurement contract will be awarded to the Lead of the Consortium.  Individual tasks will be issued under the procurement contract as transition opportunities are identified from the research results under the cooperative agreement.   Under this PA, proposals are sought to select the consortium for the CAN CTA.  Planned funding levels for the cooperative agreement are set forth in the CAN CTA PA.  Contingent upon available funding, the Army expects to support the Cognition and Neuroergonomics consortium for five years with an option for an additional five years.  An Opportunity Conference will be conducted on Wednesday, 27 August 2008, at Sheraton Imperial Hotel in Research Triangle Park, NC. The purpose of the Opportunity Conference is to provide potential offerors with technical and business information concerning the CAN CTA and to provide an opportunity for potential offerors to discuss the CAN CTA with Government personnel.  Details concerning registration and logistics associated with the Opportunity Conference can be found at: http://www.armyuniversityopportunities.com/.  All presentations provided at the Opportunity Conference will be posted subsequently on the CAN CTA website.  In addition, all questions and answers resulting from the conference that do not include proprietary information will be posted on the CAN CTA website.  Interested offerors are strongly encouraged to thoroughly review the DRAFT CAN CTA PA prior to attending the Opportunity Conference.  Further, ARL will host an Open House at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD on 20 November 2008.  More information on the Open House can be found at the CAN CTA website.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. 

The U. S. Census Bureau is the primary source of basic statistics about the population and economy of the Nation. These statistics assist the Congress, the executive branch of the Federal Government, state and local governments, the general public, and the private sector in the development and evaluation of social and economic activities. Our major programs are the periodic censuses, current surveys, and a wide range of reimbursable work for other agencies. The programs cover a broad spectrum of demographic and economic statistics. The Governments Division (GOVS) provides for the collection, review, tabulation, and dissemination of financial statistics on nearly 90,000 state and local governments in the United States. These data cover government revenues by type, expenditures by character and function, indebtedness, and cash and securities holdings. These financial statistics are essential to calculations of key U.S. Government measures of national economic performance, viz., Gross Domestic Product and the Flow of Funds Accounts. Other federal agencies, state and local legislators, researchers, businesses, and individuals also use these data. The purpose of this contract is to obtain the services of a contractor who will provide expert advice and assistance required by the Governments Division (GOVS) to complete the resurrection of the Annual Survey of Federal Government Finances (Federal Comp) and develop statistics for some of the missing years from the time series between 1995 when it was discontinued and 2007 when it was started again. This includes the research, data collection, compilation, classification, data review, and written analysis of financial data for the federal government. By contracting this year we will be able to provide government financial statistics for all levels of government (Federal, state, and local) on a corresponding basis for comparison and analysis and be able to go back into the time series to provide for some of the missing data series. This will complete a previously missing component to our measures of government finances. For Local Government Finances, the work will include completing the research and compilation of financial statements to increase the response rates for the 2007 Census of Governments Finance Phase. For the survey year 2007, OMB granted a one-year exception to the 2005 - 2007 clearance package to allow for a one-time collection of data on Defined Contribution and Healthcare Plans offered by state administered public employee retirement systems. OMB recently granted approval to extend and expand the collection of data from public-employee retirement systems by allowing the continuation of the collection from state administered systems and extending the collection to all locally administered retirement systems with assets in excess of $5 billion. The purpose of this phase of this contract is to obtain the expert experience and service required by Governments Division to update the 2007 Government Finance and Employment Classification Manual to include the statistical classification categories and definitions that are applicable to the additional collection of Defined Contribution and Healthcare Plan data. The Classification Manual was updated in 2006 and every effort is being made to keep it current and complete. The Contractor shall provide the following services: Phase I: Survey of Local Government Finance (September 15, 2008 – October 1, 2009) 1. Code/Classify data from large local governments. 2. Review and research previous coding and provide task manager with written summaries of differences found. Phase II: Survey of Public Employee Retirement Systems 1. Define the statistical classification categories and definitions that are applicable to the collection of Defined Contribution and Healthcare Plan data. 2. Develop new sections of the Government Finance and Employment Classification Manual to cover data reported by Defined Contribution and Healthcare Plans.

Provide the Branch Chief with the proposed additions and changes to the Classification Manual and meet with the Classification Manual Review Committee to finalize new sections and corrections. 5. Participate in research related to identifying new systems that offer Defined Contribution Plans and Healthcare Plans. 6. Review a sample of 10% of 2008 and 2009 compilations completed by Retirement Survey staff for accuracy and compliance with Classification Manual for Defined Benefit Section as well as Defined Contribution and Healthcare Sections. 7. Review a sample of 10% 2008 and 2009 of data submitted by respondents for accuracy and compliance with Classification Manual for Defined Benefit Section as well as Defined Contribution and Healthcare Sections. 8. Provide documentation when revisions to prior year data are identified. This documentation shall include variables involved, current value, revised value, source of data, and reason revision is needed. 9. Update material related to Defined Benefit Plan data identified as a result of sample review or research. Phase III: Survey of Federal Government Finance for FY 2008 (Completion April 2009) 1. Develop Dependent Agency List (DAL). 2. Source Research based on DAL to ensure complete coverage. 3. Collect all required sources (including negotiations with OMB and/or BEA for E-Basic files). 4.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice   HubZone Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Administrative Facilities in the Southeast Region (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN)<BR><BR>The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Barbara Giddens, 817-886- 1065; or by e-mail to Barbara.Giddens@usace.army.mil.<BR><BR>FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Re alignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presence Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where  they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisi tion and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  U SACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were id entified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Warrior in Transition (WIT) barracks  and all related Administrative Buildings and Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contrac ts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.  <BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK:  <BR><BR>Administrative Facilities <BR><BR>The Battalion Headquarters (BN HQ) facility is comprised of administration, special functions, storage and classroom components for personnel assigned to work in those facilities.

<DESC>MAINTENANCE ACTIVITES
CLOSED LANDFILL 13
FORT BENNING, GEORGIA

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES

TASK 1 - Maintenance Activities:

Background Information.  Closed Landfill 13 was a sanitary landfill used for disposal of all wastes generated on Fort Benning.  The facility was active between 1965 and 1983.  The site covers approximately 60 acres of actual fill material.  The fill zones generally lie astride and along the natural ridge at the site, with some wastes spilling over the slopes.  The site has been capped with a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle C approved cap.  The cap consists of a 24 inch thick layer of compacted soil over the wastes, an impermeable membrane liner (40 mil HDPE), a synthetic clay liner, supporting geonet and drainage materials, and a final cover of 24 inches of soil.  The cap extends to the bottom of the slopes on all sides of the natural ridge.  Side slopes vary from 3H: IV to IH: IV.  The total area covered by the capping materials is approximately 65 acres.  The site is surrounded on all sides by chain-link fencing. The total fenced area of the site is approximately 90 acres.  The site has numerous methane vents, groundwater monitoring wells, surface water collectors, drains, drain cleanouts, and drainage ditches.  All drainage ditches are lined with stone riprap along the slopes of the landfill, for erosion prevention.  Storm flow catchment basins exist on the southeast, southwest, and northern sides of the site, outside the cap but within the fenced area.  The entire site is grassed, except for existing, ongoing erosion at several locations.  Re-seeding/re-grassing repairs have been instituted under other contracts for this site.  

General Requirements and Standards:

Management of Work.  The Contractor shall furnish an experienced and qualified site manager, supervisor, or foreman to oversee all work under this contract.

The site manager shall be capable of being in direct contact, through radio or telephone, with site workers at all other times such that site workers can receive instructions without undue delays to the work.  The site manager shall furnish the Government a telephone number at which they may be contacted during daily work hours.

Scope of Effort.  The Contractor shall provide the necessary labor, time, equipment, materials, and supplies in sufficient quantity and quality to conduct the services described in a workmanship-like manner.  The work shall be conducted in accordance with established schedules and shall meet the performance standards described in these technical provisions.  

The scope of services to be performed by the Contractor covers the following work elements:

2) Trimming of grasses, weeds, and tree control along fences and in riprap ditches and drainage flumes/swales on the site. 
3) Tree removal and pruning along and outside of the perimeter fence at the site.  
4) Cleanout/maintenance of drainage ditches, culverts, check dams. 
5) Maintenance of methane vent wells and bollards, groundwater monitor wells and bollards, and drains and drain cleanouts.  
  
The performance of groundwater, surface water, and methane monitoring is not a part of this contract.  The Contractor will receive information related to groundwater, surface water, and methane conditions at the site from the Government, upon written request by the Contractor for such information.

<DESC>Background

During the past year, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) responded to food safety problems with contaminated spinach, lettuce, vegetable proteins, and peanut butter, among other foods. Whether contamination is unintentional or deliberate, there is a need to response faster and communicate more effectively with consumers and partners. Consumers protect themselves and their families from foodborne illness by responding promptly to FDA alerts. Important messages must be communicated clearly and though multiple forms of media to be effective, because different segments of the population use different technologies. In addition, major segments of the population do not use English as their primary language. In November, 2007, FDA released the Food Protection Plan, a comprehensive and integrated strategy to address both food safety and defense. The Plan calls for a rapid response as soon as contaminated food or feed is detected or when there is harm to people or animals. 

Identifying food safety threats sooner and determining the scope of the problem faster would enable FDA to quickly react and communicate the threat to industry and consumers. A major component of improving FDA’s response efforts is to improve communications with the public, industry and other stakeholders through aggressive, targeted food safety campaigns that disseminate clear and effective messages through multiple venues to all targeted audiences. In order to improve communication efforts, FDA must explore new avenues for communicating with the public, industry, and other stakeholders. Tapping into consumer generated media, such as blogs and online discussion forums, marketing information, and point-of-sale data would provide FDA with both new avenues for delivering messages as well the ability to target messages to the appropriate audience. In addition, using new mechanisms to reach the public and stakeholders would provide FDA with new means of measuring the effectiveness of communications. 

In order to evaluate the public health benefit of utilizing new communication tools, FDA seeks to develop a pilot to test and evaluate the effectiveness of new communication tools, such as using consumer generated media and marketing information, for quickly identifying and distributing information about food safety threats. 

Objective for Request for Sources

FDA is looking to identify contractors who have the expertise to develop mechanisms to improve FDA’s recall communication in the following areas: 

a.	Identify problems sooner by monitoring blogs and other media sources and looking at sales rates of products associated with foodborne illness.  

b.	Communicate better and more directly with consumers and retailers by identifying stores selling recalled product and identify and target messages to populations with the highest consumption rates of the recalled products.

c.	Verify that communications are received and the correct actions are taken by monitoring the movement of the recalled product. 

d.	Monitor the impact of recall communications, post-recall communications, and long-term impacts by monitoring consumer discussions on blogs and media coverage of the issue. Conduct quick surveys of consumers to determine their understanding and interpretation of FDA communications and gauge consumer opinions. 

Description of Information Requested

The purpose of this sources sought is to solicit information from organizations that have the experience and expertise to develop mechanism to address the areas listed above. FDA is requesting information to support the development of a six-month pilot to improve FDA’s communication surrounding a food safety threat. 

The sources (submitter) is expected to address:

1.	How a food safety communication pilot will improve communication.
2.	What mechanisms would be used to incorporate novel communication techniques. 
3.                  published rates.

Disclaimer

 FDA’s does not intent to publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtained during this sources sought. To the full extend that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as “Proprietary or Confidential” will be kept confidential. It is emphasized that this sources sought is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. 

Interesting firms may submit a website or  a five (5) page limit, 12-point font size, 1 inch margins; Authorized document formats include Adobe (.pdf), Microsoft Work (.doc) or Rich Text Format (.rft).  to the attention of the contracting officer.

The Food and Drug Administration, Jefferson Laboratories, in Jefferson, Arkansas, is seeking business sources, including service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and 8(a) certified companies. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort:

The government is seeking capability statements from sources that are capable of providing a Joint Workshop on: “Cytokines as Therapeutic Agents: Finding a Path Forward”

I. Background:  
The mission of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) is to assure that safe and effective drugs are available to the American people.  CDER promotes, protects and enhances the health of the public through drug development, evaluation and continued safety monitoring throughout the drug life cycle.  To accomplish its mission CDER must contend with many important challenges. Failure rates in clinical development have remained largely unchanged over the past two decades.  FDA’s Critical Path Initiative (CPI) seeks to identify and address scientific and technical obstacles to optimize the development of safe and therapeutically important medical products.  Under the Critical Path Initiative (CPI), FDA is trying to identify innovative ways to enhance drug development and reduce the time it takes to bring therapeutically important and safer medical products to the market by leveraging prior knowledge.

To date, recombinant and purified cytokines have fallen short of their promise as therapies.   Despite outstanding therapeutic promise and sound scientific rationale, most cytokine therapies have failed to establish clinical utility. The FDA seeks to establish a forum for joint discussions with the biopharmaceutical industry to facilitate product development for unmet medical needs in the context of the agency’s Critical Path Initiative.   

The purpose of this workshop is to provide a forum to discuss the successes and failures of recombinant cytokines as therapeutic agents for treating human diseases, including cancer and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease.  This conference will provide a forum to review the scientific and clinical basis of both successful and unsuccessful attempts to develop cytokines as therapeutic agents.  It will also provide a forum to develop strategies to increase the probability of clinical success of recombinant cytokines as therapeutic agent’s in future clinical trials.  

The meeting is designed as a forum to critically assess the factors that are limiting the clinical development of cytokines as therapeutic agents.  The FDA anticipates participation by scientists and clinicians from other federal agencies (e.g., NIH, NIST), the biopharmaceutical industry, academic institutions, consortia that may contribute to future clinical trials (e.g., Biomarker/Genomic Consortia) and others to actively participate in this unique conference.  The overall goal of the workshop is to identify areas for improvement and to coordinate, develop and disseminate novel approaches to current scientific hurdles that are impairing the development of cytokine products.


II. Objective: 

FDA wishes to collaborate on the development of a scientific workshop to address the role of cytokines as therapeutic agents.

III. Scope of Work:  

The Contractor shall work within and/or develop any necessary elements to produce the following two (2) deliverables within a twelve month (12) period.  Should it be necessary to extend the period over which this work is to be completed, a no-cost extension may be requested in writing.  Such a request must be reviewed and approved by the FDA Project Officer with concurrence from the FDA Contracting Officer.  All data and outcomes associated with this scope of work shall be provided through the Program Officer, to the FDA on both electronic format and in hard copy.  A final report shall be prepared by the Contractor, summarizing the deliverables of this award.  This report must be submitted to the FDA Project Officer electronically and in hard copy.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory, intends to negotiate with STEP TOOLS INC, Troy, NY, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subsection 13.106-1(b), for the purchase of ISO 13399 tooling database software for ST-Machine.

This requirement is the ISO 13399 tooling database option reads and writes cutting tool information using the ISO 13399 standard. With this option a STEP-NC control can read the current dimensions and remaining tool life of a cutting tool from any database that supports the ISO 13399 standard. With this option the new dimensions and remaining tool life can be written back to the tooling database from the STEP-NC control after machining has been completed. The ISO 13399 option for ST-Machine enables better planning of the machining process by ensuring that every cutting tool has sufficient tool life to complete its operations. The ISO 13399 option for ST-Machine enhances the feed/speed optimization process by allowing the current dimensions of the cutting tools to be used for the optimization. The ISO 13399 option for ST-Machine enhances machining accuracy by setting the tool compensation registers to the correct values before
machining begins.

Based on the recent market research, NIST believes that STEP TOOLS, INC is the only entity that can satisfy NIST’s requirements. NIST has extensive software written using the STEP TOOLS vendor-specific programming functions in ST-Developer, and no other company provides these vendor-specific functions.  NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price type purchase order to STEP Tools, Inc for this requirement. Interested parties that are authorized by STEP TOOLS, INC, to sell the aforementioned software license may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. Such written responses will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition.

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 does not apply to this procurement.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.     THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE.     The Solicitation Number for this announcement is W91238-08-S0825.     United States Army Corps of Engineers, South Pacific Division, Sacramento District, solicits for Capability Statements from all qualified and interested 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned, or HUBZone Small Business parties to participate in a design and build construction solicitation for water treatment facility at Sierra Army Depot, Herlong, CA.     The 2002 NAICS Code for the proposed acquisition is 221310, Water Treatment Plants, and the small business size standard is $6.5 Mil. Federal Supply Code is Y 245, Construction of water supply.     Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 20 percent of the contract work with his-or-her own employees. The Government will use responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT synopsis to make appropriate acquisition decisions to solicit this project as either a competitive 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned, or HubZone , Small Business or Unrestricted.  The proposed acquisition will be a design-build solicitation.     Proposals will be evaluated using Trade-Off source selection procedures that will result in award of a firm-fixed price design/build contract to the responsible proposer whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is the BEST VALUE to the Government, price and technical factors considered.     The proposed project will consist of the design and construction of a water treatment system.  <BR><BR>Sierra has three potable water wells; these wells exceed the allowable levels for manganese, iron, and uranium. The State of California has demanded that corrective action be taken. This project is intended to provide treatment facilities at two of the three wells to eliminate the contaminant load (the third well, #9, will be pumped to the nearest well, #5, and be treated there due to real estate constraints). Further, design will be required to transport wastewater generated by the treatment methodology, to a disposable area on the north area of the post. Further, building 92, which houses limited telemetry on the existing system, will be gutted to provide sufficient space for all the new control equipment and electronic record-keeping equipment to monitor the system..  The estimated cost of this acquisition is between $10,000,000 and $12,000,000.     Completion of the design and construction of the facility will have a maximum duration of 540 days.  The Government invites contractors with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements to submit Capability Statements consisting of appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references anticipated to be five to ten pages, following the set format.     Respondents must include references and a capability statement for at least two completed projects within the last three years of similar design/build work within the same dollar value magnitude of this notice adjusted for inflation.  Each reference shall include the company name and title, telephone number, and point of contact.

<CONTACT>Ida J Lirette, Fax 504-286-4216, Email ida.lirette@ars.usda.gov
<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service intends to issue and award to TA Instruments in New Castle, Delaware on a sole source basis.  Award will be made pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.     

The U.S. Department of Agriculture proposes to sole source purchase a Multi-cell DSC Complete System (115V).  

Description of Supplies/Services:  The TA Instruments Multi-cell Differential Scanning Calorimeter, Model 4100, meets the following specific design and performance specifications which are not offered at all, or cannot be met/exceeded by any other current commercial source which is required to meet the Center’s mission.

The model 4100 MC-DSC is a unique, scanning microcalorimeter, which is designed to accommodate a wide range of samples, including both solid and liquid forms.   To accommodate this range of application, the microcalorimeter uses removable samples ampoules, which are offered in various materials of construction, including primarily Hastelloy, glass and steel (for high pressure).

1.	The MC-DSC is absolutely unique in that it can accommodate three (3) sample ampoules  simultaneously, tested in independent sample measurement cells, against a common reference ampoule.
2.	Some models of commercial microcalorimeter, specifically those designed exclusively for protein/solution analysis, offer higher levels of specific sensitivity and baseline stability.    However, the MC-DSC is the ONLY commercial scanning microcalorimeter that can accommodate BOTH liquid and solid form samples, that provides the sensitivity of <10ucal/degC, or baseline reproducibility of <25ucal at heating rate of 1degC/min.   This level of sensitivity and baseline stability is essential for both low-energy transition detection and quantification, and also to accommodate small sample volumes, when necessary.
3.	The MC-DSC is the only commercial scanning microcalorimeter that can accommodate samples as large as 1ml in volume.   This capability is crucial in two aspects: (1) to allow large volume of samples to be used, when available, to enhance the total heat evolved during phase transformations and improve the specific sensitivity to, and resolution of these transitions; (2) to allow the use of optional high-pressure and perfusion ampoules to be used, in which the large head-space available in a 1ml ampoule can be used to accommodate either pressurization of the ampoule, or to allow gas and/or liquid to be perfused into the ampoule during testing to elicit a desired phase change in the sample.


The Multi-cell DSC Complete System (115V) shall be installed, delivery FOB, to the USDA, ARS, SRRC, New Orleans, Louisiana.  

Responses are to be received within 15 days of this notice.     The NAICS Code/Size is 423490. This procurement will be processed pursuant to FAR part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.     No telephone inquiries will be accepted.     No solicitation will be issued.     Questions can be e-mailed ida.lirette@ars.usda.gov.

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<br />United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, Tampa, FL 33621, requires renewal of Environmental Systems Research Institute's ArcGIS software licenses for maintenance and support. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make a firm fixed price award, with options, to Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), 380 New York St., Redlands, CA 92373. Interested parties may e-mail stephen.colton@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-6967, Attn: Stephen Colton, not later than Monday,&nbsp;18 August, 2008; 4:00 p.m. EST.<br />Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:<br />22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)
<p>The decision to purchase ESRI's ArcGIS software maintenance renewals is based on two points: 1) It is the command standard for geographic software. 2) The program allows integration with the Special Operations Forces Analysis and Modeling System (SOFAMS) database, other software currently available does not. In addition, the cost of changing software would be cost prohibitive and far exceeds the current Government estimate. A new program, of a similar type would cost over $50,000.00 and would require a complete rewrite of the code used in the Special Operations Forces Analysis and Modeling System (SOFAMS) program. USSOCOM currently has 19 Military and Government Contractors trained to use the ArcGIS software; retraining would, again, be cost prohibitive in terms of man-hours and time lost in database entries, runs, and analysis for the Joint Mission Analysis. This would start a domino effect for final submission into the Strategic Planning Process (SPP), thus delaying reporting of personnel and material required for Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) approved scenarios for the Global War on Terror (GWOT) to USSOCOM Board of Directors and the Joint Staff.</p>

<SUBJECT>Capillary Electrophoresis system and an Automated DNA purification instrument
<SOLNBR>PR-199333
<RESPDATE>081808
<CONTACT>Nathan Johnson, Email nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture – Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) anticipates a sole source (name brand) procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for a Capillary Electrophoresis system and an Automated DNA purification instrument consisting of a QIAxcel (catalog number 9001421), QIACube (catalog number 9001292), installation, and miscellaneous items (e.g., starter packs and sample tubes).    

The PPQ Molecular Diagnostic Lab (MDL) supports PPQ programs by providing final identifications of targeted quarantine plant pests using molecular and biochemical tests.  The results of these diagnostic tests are the basis for making regulatory decisions and taking regulatory actions which are critical in preventing the spread of quarantine pests.  The MDL must provide the identifications in a timely manner and most importantly they must be accurate or inappropriate regulatory decisions will be made.  It is essential that the equipment used in the diagnostic work be dependable, accurate and rapid.

The QIAxcel system simultaneously performs a fully-automated and high-resolution capillary electrophoresis for up to 96 samples.  This system uses a higher throughput (96 versus 20-30) that is fully automated and requires small amounts of DNA to provide robust results.  The BioCalculator software that is part of the system provides a rapid and accurate means of evaluating sample testing results, allows viewing results in various forms, and documents results rapidly and accurately.  We know of no other system that provides the ease of use of a capillary electrophoresis system.

The QIAcube performs simultaneous fully-automated purification of nucleic acids of up to 12 samples.  The purification of DNA is a time-consuming step in the beginning of the process of molecular diagnostics.  Most of the protocols that the MDL uses require a Qiagen kit for DNA purification.  We know of no other system that can provide this level of sample processing.

Interested sources that are capable of providing the equivalent supply listed above are encouraged to submit statements of capability to the contracting office.  Small business concerns are encouraged to participate.  This is not a request for competitive proposals, but instead a market research method to determine interested sources.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive (i.e., non-brand name) procurement.  No requests for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice.  Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature.  Please provide past performance and references regarding your ability to provide this supply and service along with your Statement of Capability.   The Government will not award a contract based on the information received, nor reimburse participants for information they provide.  Information provided is strictly voluntary.  Please email Statements of Capability Nathan Johnson Nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov.  Telephonic inquiries will not be honored.  Closing date for submission of Statement’s of Capability is August 18, 2008 at 3:00 p.m. CST.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 334516 with a small business size standard of less than 500 employees.

<DESC>CAC and Fort Leavenworth Support Services IDIQ<BR>Contractor Comments/ Recommendations<BR><BR><BR>1.	Page Limitation: concur with 100 page technical volume without tables and appendices and excluding management page count. With 20 plus tasks, inclusion of management plan in technical volume page count would not leave enough room to adequately address all of the tasks.<BR><BR>2.	Recommend a cross reference matrix be added to the page exclusion. Recommend that remaining volumes be page independent.<BR><BR>3.	Comment:  Functional Area 10: Software VV&A page 16 is not listed on pages 1 and 12 as one of the functional areas. <BR><BR>4.	Recommend add Software VV&A FA10 to the lists on pages 1 and 12.<BR><BR>5.	REF: B.6.1.1 Education and Experience  We recommend the following modifications to the general descriptions of the levels of proficiency in this section to allow for substitution of experience for a formal degree.  <BR><BR>Senior:  Possesses a Masters degree or higher in a discipline closely related to the work being performed.  Possesses at least ten years of experience directly related to the work being performed.  Performs advanced level of work such as designing systems or plans for studies and analysis for complex tasks.  Capable of performing as a team lead with overall responsibility for planning and executing tasks.  May supervise Journeyman and Junior level personnel.  Six (6) years of additional experience may be substituted for a Masters degree.<BR><BR>Journeyman:  Possesses a Bachelors degree or higher in a discipline closely related to the work being performed.  Possesses at least three years of experience directly related to the work being performed.  Performs routine levels of work such as designing systems or plans for studies and analysis for less complex tasks.  Executes  designs/plans to accomplish tasks.  Capable of working independently with general oversight by a Senior.  May supervise Junior level personnel.  Four (4) years of additional experience may be substituted for a Bachelors degree.<BR><BR>Junior:  Possesses an Associates degree or higher in a discipline closely related to the work being performed.  Possesses less than three years of experience directly related to the work being performed.  Performs routine levels of work to accomplish tasks.  Works closely with and is supervised by Journeyman or Senior level personnel.  Two (2) years of additional experience may be substituted for an Associates degree.<BR><BR>6.	REF: L.3.2 Evaluation Factor 2: Technical approach for each Functional Area in the PWS  We recommend that you remove Subfactor B (Risk Identification and Management Plan) from this factor and incorporate it as part of Subfactor B Quality Control Plan (part of the Management and Quality Control factor) or make it Subfactor D within the Management and Quality Control factor.<BR><BR>7.	REF: L.3.3 Evaluation Factor 3: Management and Quality Control  Should resumes be required as part of this factor, we recommend the following:<BR><BR>The resumes are to be representative in nature and not attributable to a particular person.<BR><BR>Offerors are limited to no more than 10 resumes, not to exceed 3 pages each. The resumes are not included in the page count, but rather treated as an appendix to the Management and Quality Control volume.<BR><BR>8.	REF: Evaluation Factor 4: Small Business Subcontracting Plan  Given the undefined nature of the CAC IDIQ tasks at the IDIQ level, we recommend requiring submission of a Small Business Participation Plan, with a Small Business Subcontracting Plan (consistent with the percentages committed to in the Participation Plan) to be submitted at the task order level.  We recommend replacement of the existing Section L language with the following:<BR><BR>3.4.1 Proposal Requirements: Large businesses shall submit a Small Business Participation Plan that describes: <BR><BR>The nature of the work relative to the SOW the Offeror may anticipate subcontracting to Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, HUBZones, and Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Minority Institutions at the task order level.  In percentage terms, include your overall small business participation goal along with your subcontracting goals for each socio-economic category identified above.<BR><BR>As set forth below, all awardees will be responsible for meeting the Governments Small Business Participation goal of not less than XXX% of the total funded amount of all task orders awarded under this IDIQ contract over the life of the contract.  Offerors shall describe efforts that will be taken to meet or exceed the overall Small Business Participation goal of XXX%. Offerors shall also describe efforts they will take to meet or exceed their proposed subcontracting goals for each of the socio-economic categories specified in section 3.4.1.1.<BR><BR>NOTE:  The Small Business Participation Plan is separate from the Subcontracting Plan required by FAR Part 19.7 and DFARS 219.7.  Large Business Offerors shall not submit a Subcontracting Plan as required by FAR clause 52.219-9 with their proposal.  Subcontracting Plans required by FAR clause 52.219-9 will be submitted as applicable at the delivery/task order level.  <BR><BR>The utilization goals for this acquisition and for use in the development of the plans are listed in the following table:<BR>INSERT TABLE BASED ON FINAL SUBCONTRACTING GOALS ESTABLISHED.<BR><BR>9.	The Section M evaluation criteria would then be modified in accordance with this revision.<BR><BR>10.	REF: 3.4.1 Proposal Requirements  We recommend clarification of the Small Business Subcontracting Goals.  The following table was presented in the draft RFP, Section L released on July 17th:<BR>11.	<BR>Small Business Subcontracting Goals<BR>Small Business	24.0%<BR>Small Disadvantaged Business	3.0%<BR>Woman Owned Small Business	6.5%<BR>Hub Zone	3.5%<BR>Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business 	3.0%<BR><BR>Traditionally, the Small Business percentage in the first row represents the overall total goal for a  procurement.  The remaining categories represent a subset of that overall goal with the remainder to be allocated by the Offeror.  The verbal explanation presented at Industry Day suggested that these numbers are to be added together forming an overall small business participation goal of 40%.  We have two recommendations regarding this table:<BR><BR>Make the first row reflect the overall goal for the procurement, consistent with the way the information is traditionally presented.<BR>Establish minimum goals consistent with the Armys FY 2009 goals and encourage Offerors to exceed the minimum goals for enhanced evaluation of their respective participation plans.<BR><BR>12.	REF: Evaluation Factor 5: Price  In order to streamline the evaluation at the IDIQ level, and avoid substantial burdens on our small business team members, we recommend revising subsection 3.5.1 Proposal Submission as follows:<BR><BR>3.5.1 Proposal Submission: Loaded Labor Rates for the base period and each option year listed in Section B shall be provided for the prime offeror only.  Rates for subcontractors will be negotiated at the task order level, as applicable.<BR><BR>13.	REF: M.2.1 Evaluation Factor 3: Management and Quality Control  We recommend that Factors 2 and 3 be reversed given the overall importance of our management approach and business processes at the IDIQ level vice the technical aspects of our approach, which will be much more important at the task order level.  We further recommend that M.1.5 be revised as follows:<BR>Relative Importance  The evaluation to determine acceptability will be based on a complete assessment of each Offerors proposal. Proposals shall be evaluated on the following five factors, where factor 1 is more important than factors 2, 3, and 4; factor 2 is more important than factors 3 and 4; factors 3 and 4 are of equal importance. &<BR><BR>14.	FA for IT support:  Like the V&V this may want to be removed as a stand alone functional area.  A lot of the other functional areas have IT requirements imbedded or implied, but they are fairly specific to that functional area.  If a TO was going to be purely IT, it may be a candidate for a small business award, or would likely be better on an IDIQ like ITES2 where you would have access to IT specific firms.  If you keep it, we only see one superficial reference to IT Security in the IT support section and think that that is an important aspect of may IT related tasks.<BR><BR>15.	FA for Knowledge Management.  Think that you should add; Conduct  Knowledge Needs Assessments to help define KM priorities and SW/HW requirements.<BR><BR>16.	We also think that you should do away with the publication production FA.  Since you had specifically said that it was not the printing, but the preparation and that is really part of the FAs that include producing documentation as a deliverable, and as a stand alone task that would also be something that would normally be easy for a small business. <BR><BR>17.	On the labor category side, nothing was mentioned of a need for a system architect or business analyst function in the labor categories.  The IT Systems Engineer seems to be a catchall, but there are several functional areas that require architecture type skills so we think that should be added.  There is a good example of a description in the GSA IT schedule.  Lack of a business analyst role is a definite shortcoming. Acknowledge that the list is not all inclusive but we think these two LCATs are rather significant at the IDIQ level.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>18.	Would recommend that you include experience as well as education:<BR><BR>      Junior: AA or 3 years direct experience<BR>      Journeyman: BS or BA or 5 years direct experience<BR>     Senior: Masters or BS or BA and 5 years direct experience<BR><BR>19.	We would recommend that he give each section a page limit , 20 for past performance (10 max at 2 pages each), 30 for management, 20 for small business and 3 pages max for each functional area for technical.  We would also recommend that be scored in term of value in that order.  Since technical will be more important at the task order level we though it might be rated lowest.  In fact for STOCII there was not a technical volume, so you may want to think about a slight larger management volume and no tech section.<BR><BR>20.	We would recommend you publish a template (see attachment) for the past performance and limit each to two pages.  It will make it easier to evaluate if they have common items in the template.<BR><BR><BR>PERFORMANCE INFORMATION <BR>A. Company Name:<BR>B. Program Title: <BR>C. Contract Specifics:<BR>1.

We recommend page counts be designated for each part versus 100 pages as a whole. This would correlate better to NRCC's intent to disseminate parts separately. As for the number of pages, I am conscious that the more pages you allow, the good idea folks have a tendency to expand to it.  From my experience, a 100 page count is feasible with the exception that any graphics such as process maps, organizational charts, risk management matrices, certs, resumes and past performance are exclusive of page count and listed as appendices.<BR><BR>24.	Additionally, I would recommend you state the minimum font accepted as there is a tendency to reduce the font to add the bulk.<BR>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Applied Biosystems, 850 Lincoln Centre Drive, Foster City, CA 94404-1128, for customized TLDA cards. Acute respiratory infections are among the most common causes of human disease, and newly emerging respiratory pathogens, like SARS coronavirus and avian influenza, pose the added risk of pandemic outbreaks. A wide spectrum of microorganisms (primarily viruses and bacteria) can cause respiratory illness and clinical presentation is often of little diagnostic value. Consequently, there is a great need for improved diagnostic assays; however, conventional methods such as culture, antigen detection or serology may lack speed, sensitivity or availability for concurrent detection of multiple microbes. TaqMan Low Density Array (TLDA) cards provide a novel application of the TaqMan real-time PCR assay in a non-multiplexed format capable of rapid, simultaneous testing of multiple clinical specimens for up to 21 respiratory pathogens plus controls. Applied Biosystems will provide a format 24 TLDA, with assays designed, synthesized and formulated by the customer. Applied Biosystems services will provide spotting up to 23 CDC-provided assays on blank standard 384-well TaqMan Array cards (TLDA) at card locations specified by CDC, with one 18S or GAPDH calibration assay specified by CDC per port; one IPC furnished to CDC under a Material Transfer Agreement effective as of October 1, 2007; and delivering spotted cards to CDC under mutually agreed schedule. CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. Please notify the POC by email if you wish to provide a quote.</p>

<DESC>Title:  Data analysis to assess duration of chlamydia infection and sequelae

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for HIV, Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention intends to award a sole source contract under Simplified Acquisition procedures to Indiana University School of Medicine, Department of Infectious Disease, 545 N. Barnhill Drive Indianapolis, IN 46202, the only source that has access to prior data required to perform this contract.  

In April 2008, the Division of STD Prevention convened the Chlamydia Immunology and Control Expert Advisory Meeting to establish research priorities related to chlamydia natural history that would help guide chlamydia control programs. One of those priorities was to establish better quantitative estimates of the risk of complications of untreated genital chlamydia infections and the timing of those complications. During the Expert Advisory Meeting, it became apparent that researchers at Indiana University have already identified a large cohort of women who have been tested for chlamydia together with documented treatment information through an existing, well-established electronic medical record system, the Regenstrief Medical Record System (RMRS). This effort has given them a unique opportunity to assess the relationship between chlamydia, its treatment and its sequelae such as ectopic pregnancy, to allow them to address this gap in knowledge.

The purpose of this action is to secure the services of the Indiana University School of Medicine (1) to extract data to develop an observational cohort of women with documented pregnancy from the RMRS to determine incidence rates of ectopic pregnancy by chlamydia test status,  (2) to assess the potential association between the presence or timeliness of chlamydia treatment (i.e., the duration of untreated infection) and ectopic pregnancy, and (3) prepare a manuscript.

The period of performance is no more than 12 months from date of award.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on response to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The NAICS code is 541712.

<DESC><p>Proposed addition of Wiper, Laminated to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Wiper, Laminated by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L). You can view the P/L on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the P/L to be provided by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.</p>
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:</p>
<p>7920-00-NIB-0439</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration/Federal Supply Service, Fort Worth, TX.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Wiper, Laminated to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>7920-01-370-1364<br />7920-01-370-1365<br />7920-01-454-5879<br />7920-01-512-2412</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Wiper, Laminated to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than August 28, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the P/L.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0030. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>PROPOSERS’ DAY CONFERENCE
DARPA will host a Proposers’ Day Workshop in support of the anticipated Panoptic Analysis of Chemical Traces (PACT) BAA on Wednesday, September 3, 2008 at Booz Allen Hamilton, 3811 N. Fairfax Drive, 6th Floor, Arlington, VA 22203-1701 from 10 AM to 4 PM.  The purposes of this conference are to provide information on the PACT program; promote additional discussion on high throughput chemical analysis of gas mixtures; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  Attendance is not required to propose to any associated BAA.  The Performers’ Day materials will be made available to qualified proposers who are not able to attend the Proposers’ Day.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The objective of the PACT program is to develop high-throughput analysis methods to quantitatively and exhaustively catalog the constituents of complex gas mixtures obtained from strategically important sampling locations.  The system will accurately identify and rank the amounts of all components from an established library of materials and quantify the extent to which materials not in the library are present. The amount of each component in the mixtures will range from 50 picomoles to 50 micromoles. PACT will also develop forensic methods to identify the composition of materials and mixtures for which library data are unavailable. The ultimate goal of the program is to develop a capability for comprehensive analysis of up to three hundred thousand samples per day on a routine and cost-effective basis.  DARPA-BAA-08-62 is pending release.  When released, the BAA will be found on the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

REGISTRATION INFORMATION:  Participants must register no later than 5 PM EST on August 29, 2008, at the following website: http://www.schafertmd.com/conference/PACT.

<DESC><p>The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to non-competitively negotiate with the Cleveland Clinic located in Cleveland Ohio for the further development of methodological analysis procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this project will investigate new methods for developing and evaluating algorithmic methods for analyzing large sets of censored data.  The methods employed to conduct this research will include Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) and Random Survival Forests (RSF).  Testing will be conducted on a variety of cohorts, including patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass surgery, asymptomatic adults undergoing screening studies, patients with valve disease, patients undergoing exercise testing, and patients with heart failure.</p>
<p>The Cleveland Clinic has used cutting edge methodologies, such as propensity analysis and logical analysis of data to answer important clinical questions.  During the past few years  Cleveland's collaborations with world renowned mathematicians and biostatistical researchers  have led to the application of LAD and RSF to patient oriented research questions. This program has also successfully forged close collaboration with investigators from many different disciplines, i.e., specialists and researchers in population-based epidemiology, biostatistics, operations research, surgical outcomes research, nuclear imaging, echocardiography, interventional cardiology, health services research, health-care economics, geriatrics, biomedical engineering, cardiac surgery, pulmonology, and thoracic oncology surgery.</p>
<p>The work proposed will be conducted with information maintained in their Heart and Vascular Center's Cardiovascular Information Registry.  This is a unique clinical epidemiology database containing millions of diagnostic cardiovascular tests and hundreds of thousands of procedures, along with follow-up of hundreds of thousands of patients.  This information source will be utilized to invent, develop, and disseminate modern algorithmic methods of complex data analysis.  This acquisition allows the NHLBI to take advantage of huge patient volumes and granular well-defined data elements within a nationally recognized information infrastructure.  Access to the registry allows for the development of methods that promise to transcend the serious limitations of classical regression modeling.  Cardiovascular Information Registry is an extremely effective resource that includes baseline and follow-up data on patients who have undergone cardiovascular tests and/or procedures performed dating back to the early 1970's.  In addition, the personnel and expertise needed to acquire, manage, maintain, analyze and develop methods based upon the data is available at the institution.  The Registry has led to, for example, one of the leading risk prediction instruments for patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery.  Over the past 10-15 years, this resource has come to include highly discrete data on high volumes of cardiovascular diagnostic tests, including over 200,000 stress tests (with and without imaging) and over 1.3 million electrocardiograms (with up to 500 digitally obtained variables on each one).  Software applications will be derived from this research which will be widely available at no cost to the research community.</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent, not a request for competitive proposals.  The resulting acquisition will be entered into pursuant to the acquisition authority set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C.253(c) (1) - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>

Rationale for sole source: Research has shown that there are many companies that provide video-on-demand (VOD) services but many of these companies do not provide a true broadcast quality VOD or only provide the software or partial service for distribution of VOD. A large portion of VOD providers push Near VOD, a pay-per-view or a Push VOD technique that lacks the interactivity to provide true VOD. What has become common is that many VOD providers do not provide an all inclusive service and have not networked themselves into the market across the country but only in limited marker areas. Our research included a web based search of VOD providers who provided services to cable companies that utilize or would like to utilize Pentagon Channel programming but lack the channel space until full digital conversion. Broadcast VOD can not be confused with web VOD. However, efforts to ensure that offers are solicited from many sources is not possible based upon the following set of facts: a. Reach – TVN currently packages, distributes and manages more than 3000 hours of VOD programming every month from more than 150 content providers. This includes most of the major network and cable providers around the world. b. Deployment - TVN holds over 90% of the video on demand market, making them the largest VOD provider in the US. TVN is deployed to over 300 cable head ends and is integrated with every combination of VOD server, middleware, IPG and set-top box. TVN is the only single source solution for On Demand programming. TVN offers content services including aggregation, metadata creation, encoding, distribution, asset management and 24- hour customer technical support. c. Experience - Their diversity of content and special marketing needs is proven with their current cliental of over 80 small and medium sized markets. Optimizing the content mix, providing turn-key programs and supplying intuitive management tools that are critical to launching and managing a cost-effective VOD solution. TVN is the only company that all MSO’s accept VODs from. TVN is also the only VOD aggregate that can provide content to not only Cable but Satellite and Telco systems as well. TVN also has the capability to monitor VOD systems ad asset information to not only make necessary corrections if needed but also report statistical download data. This announcement constitutes the only notice, a written solicitation will not be issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<p>PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS)<br />Project: Investigation Support Services (Combustibility Analysis)<br />Imperial Sugar Refinery, Port Wentworth, GA<br />Investigation number: CSB-2008-05-I-GA</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />The Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) is an independent federal agency with the mission of ensuring the safety of workers and the public by preventing or minimizing the effects of chemical incidents at industrial facilities. The CSB is a scientific investigation organization; it is not an enforcement or regulatory body. Established by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the CSB is responsible for determining the probable causes of incidents, issuing safety recommendations, studying chemical safety issues, and evaluating the effectiveness of other government agencies involved with industrial chemical safety. Section 112 (r) (6) (G) of the Clean Air Act prohibits the use of any conclusions, findings, or recommendations of the CSB relating to any chemical incident from being admitted as evidence or used in any lawsuit arising out of any matter mentioned in an investigation report. Congress modeled the CSB after the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which investigates aircraft and other transportation accidents for the purpose of improving safety. Like the NTSB, the CSB makes public its actions and decisions through investigation reports, safety studies, safety recommendations, special technical publications, and statistical reviews.</p>
<p>INCIDENT BACKGROUND<br />On February 7, 2008, a fire and explosion occurred at the Imperial Sugar Refinery in Port Wentworth, GA, causing 13 fatalities and injuring over 40 workers. The explosion caused extensive damaged to the packaging areas of the facility in addition to other portions of the refinery in outlying areas. The refinery processed raw sugar into finished products that included, granulated sugar, powdered sugar, brown sugar, and other specialized sugar products.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE:<br />The objective of this solicitation is to obtain the services of a testing firm (the contractor) with the expertise and capability to provide combustibility analysis of substances recovered from the Imperial Sugar Refinery site.</p>
<p>SCOPE:<br />Work shall be performed at the contractor's facility. Except where explicitly noted otherwise in this PWS, the contractor is required to provide all equipment and materials necessary to conduct testing as set forth in the detailed protocols itemized in the Task Section of this document. Test samples will be provided to the contractor by the CSB.</p>
<p>Test protocols developed by the contractor must be consistent with ASTM E860-97, "Standard Practices for Examining and Testing Items That Are or May Become Involved in Litigation."</p>
<p>TASKS:<br />The contractor shall perform the following tasks. The contractor shall conduct all testing in strict compliance with the ASTM standards and specifications listed below. Modifications proposed by the contractor for purposes of quality and efficiency will be considered by the CSB. However, all changes must be authorized in writing by the CSB Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) and no deviations are permitted without such authorization.</p>
<p>Task 1 MOISTURE CONTENT DETERMINATION</p>
<p>Determine the as-received moisture content of each test sample.</p>
<p>o Powdered sugar<br />o Granulated sugar<br />o Corn starch</p>
<p>Task 2 PARTICLE SIZE MEASUREMENT/DISTRIBUTION</p>
<p>2a Powdered sugar and corn starch</p>
<p>Measure and record the as received particle size.</p>
<p>2b Granulated sugar</p>
<p>Measure and record the weight percent particle size distribution using the following particle sizes:</p>
<p>o &gt;500 micron<br />o 500<br />o 250<br />o 125<br />o 63<br />o 32</p>
<p>Task 3 DUST EXPLOSIBILITY TESTING</p>
<p>Powdered sugar and corn starch samples will be tested in the as-received condition. Granulated sugar testing shall be performed on the following particle size samples:</p>
<p>o As-received<br />o Screened to remove particles &gt;500 micron i.e., one sample containing particle sizes less than or equal to 500 micron.</p>
<p>3a Explosion Severity</p>
<p>Test samples in compliance with ASTM E1226 00, "Standard Test Method for Pressure and Rate of Pressure Rise for Combustible Dusts", and report the following:</p>
<p>Pmax - the maximum pressure (above the initial pressure in the vessel at the time of ignition) reached during the course of a deflagration for the optimum concentration of the dust tested.</p>
<p>dP/dt)max - the maximum value for the rate of pressure increase per unit time reached during the course of a deflagration in the test vessel for the optimum concentration of dust tested..</p>
<p>Deflagration Index, KSt - the maximum dP/dt (dP/dtmax) normalized to a 1-m&sup3; volume. KSt is defined in accordance with the following cubic relationship:</p>
<p>KSt = (dP/dt) max &times; V 1/3</p>
<p>where: <br />P = Pressure, bar<br />t = Time, sec,<br />V = Volume, m3,</p>
<p><br />3b Minimum Explosible Concentration (MEC)</p>
<p>Test samples in compliance with ASTM E1515-00, "Standard Test Method for Minimum Explosible Concentration of Combustible Dusts", and report the MEC for each material tested.</p>

<p>Contractor Testimony<br />Contractor shall immediately report to the General Counsel of the CSB any and all requests for the testimony of Contractor, its personnel, and/or its subcontractors, and any intention to testify as a witness relating to: (a) any work required by and/or performed for the CSB; (b) any information or data produced by Contractor in the course of its work for the CSB; or (c) any information provided by any individual or entity to assist Contractor in performing work for the CSB. All requests for testimony of Contractor, its personnel, and/or its subcontractors that fall within the scope of 40 C.F.R. part 1611 shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of that regulation.</p>
<p>Organizational Conflicts of Interest<br />a. Contractor, its personnel, and any other person or entity performing work for Contractor on behalf of the CSB, shall execute a certification of non-conflict of interest. Such executed certification constitutes the signatory's acknowledgement that he/she has read and understands the requirements of this clause and agrees to abide by its terms.<br />b. Contractor and its personnel performing work for the CSB under this order should not be placed in a conflicting role because of current or planned interests (whether financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise), which relate to the work performed under this order, nor should Contractor obtain an unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of its performance under this order.<br />c. Contractor warrants that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, or in the alternative, warrants that it has fully disclosed all such relevant information. Additionally, during the period of performance under this order, Contractor agrees to forego entering into any other contractual arrangements with any firm or organization, the result of which may give rise to a conflict of interest with respect to the work being performed under this order. Contractor shall ensure that all agents, employees, and subcontractors retained for any purpose under this order abide by the provisions of this entire clause. If Contractor has reason to believe, with respect to itself or any of its agents, employees, or subcontractors, that any proposed contractual arrangement with any firm or organization may involve a potential conflict of interest, Contractor shall obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer and the General Counsel of the CSB before the execution of such contractual arrangement.<br />d. Contractor further agrees that if, after it commences work for the CSB, it discovers organizational conflicts of interest with respect to this order, it shall make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer and the General Counsel of the CSB. It is agreed that this disclosure will include a description of the action that Contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid or mitigate the conflicts. Contractor shall continue performance until notified by the Contracting Officer of any contrary and/or supplemental action to be taken.<br />e. It is the specific responsibility of Contractor to ensure that any and all subcontractors, and any subcontractors' employees, are free from conflicts of interest. Contractor warrants that no subcontractors already identified, or any of their subcontractors' employees, have an identifiable conflict of interest. It is further agreed that, in the event a conflict of interest is discovered after award of the subcontract, the same rules for disclosure, and all of the same remedies open to the CSB, described below, remain binding. Contractor further agrees to insert in each subcontract or agreement done in furtherance of this order, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this entire clause.<br />f. During the period of performance under this order, Contractor specifically agrees not to represent, assist, be employed by, or otherwise perform any services or functions for Imperial Sugar (Imperial), or for Imperial's agents, insurers, or successors in interest (but only to the extent that work for such agents, insurers, or successors in interest would pertain to the February 7, 2008, incident at the Imperial refinery in Port Wentworth, Georgia); or for any other entity or individual that is the subject of an official CSB investigation. Contractor also agrees not to represent, assist, be employed by, or otherwise perform any services or functions for Imperial or its agents, insurers, or successors in interest (but only to the extent that work for such agents, insurers, or successors in interest would pertain to the February 7, 2008, incident at the Imperial refinery in Port Wentworth, Georgia) for a period of six months after the end of the period of performance under this order. Additionally, if Contractor performs work for the CSB under this order at the site of an official CSB investigation, Contractor agrees not to solicit work at that site from the entity or individual being investigated for a period of six months after the issuance of the final CSB report on that investigation.<br />g. Notwithstanding the immediately foregoing prohibitions, the Contracting Officer and the General Counsel of the CSB may authorize Contractor to solicit or perform this general type of work if the Contracting Officer and the General Counsel determine that the situation will not pose a potential for bias or unfair competitive advantage, and they approve of the proposed solicitation or work.<br />h. For breach of any of the above restrictions, or for intentional nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant conflicts of interest required to be disclosed concerning this order, or for such erroneous representations that necessarily imply bad faith, the CSB may terminate the order for default, disqualify Contractor from subsequent contracts, and pursue other remedies permitted by law or this order. Notwithstanding these remedies, however, the CSB may always terminate the order for convenience, in whole or in part, if termination is in the best interests of the government.</p>
<p>Proprietary Rights<br />Contractor agrees that all property rights, including publication rights, in any information and materials that are newly produced by the Contractor specifically for the CSB under this order shall vest in the government. Information and materials shall include, but not be limited to: progress reports, source data, plans, systems analyses, reports, extracts, test data, and procedures. Contractor shall not publish any of the results of its work for the CSB under this order without the prior written approval of the General Counsel of the CSB.</p>

<p>Task #7. Provide a draft CDA for Public Health Case Reporting Implementation Guide. The IG will contain full sample instances, descriptions of the constraints/extensions on CDA and will define allowable vocabulary. Also to be provided are a validating rule set (XPath, Schematron), and, if required, a modified base schema (xsd) for conformance checking and de-bugging. Note: the IG may not be written using the formal conformance language required for HL7 publications, but will be clear and sufficient to support implementation at vendor sites.</p>
<p>Task #8. Provide preliminary Public Health Case Reporting-specific style sheet. This is to be an XSL style sheet that renders the CDA report instances for viewing in a web browser. The purpose is to allow easy distribution of CDA reports and to facilitate quality control and debugging of report instances.</p>
<p>Task #9. Provide a ballot-ready IG for submission as an HL7 Draft Standard for Trial Use (DSTU). The IG will conform to the requirements of an HL7 DSTU ballot, will include descriptions of the approach and all constraints/extensions required to support CDA implementation of Public Health Case Reporting for the four initial example cases and will finalize the schema, validating rule set and style sheet.</p>
<p>Task #10. Provide a ballot reconciliation and comment resolution on DSTU ballot. Provide training material for vendors developed in parallel with the IG that supports CDA implementation. This material will be provided in an electronic file format that is ready for posting at a CDC web site and available for public distribution.

     -Green (532 nm) wavelength that is clinically proven for superior absorption in melanin and 
     hemoglobin and treatment through clear media. 
     -Yellow (561 nm) wavelength that is less painful during and post laser treatment, allows    
     for low absorption in xanthophyll with a greater margin of safety, and less intraocular 
     scatter which treats through sclerotic lens more easily. 
     -Red (659 nm) wavelength that allows for deeper choroidal penetration, low absorption by 
     oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, and proves useful for treating vitreous and 
     sub-retinal hemorrhages. 
     -The output must have the capability to be switched between the different wavelengths 
     through a touch screen and a remote control. 
     -Must have the capability adjusted the energy from 50mW to 1500mW for the Green 
     wavelength and 50mW to 600mW for the Red and Yellow wavelengths. 
     -Must have the capability to change the pulse duration from .01-3.0 seconds and the pulse  
     rate from .05-1.0 second or single pulse. Aiming is achieved with a 635nm adjustable

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Federal Protective Service (FPS) has a requirement for the use of a firearms range where mandatory quarterly qualifications and other firearms training may be conducted. The range shall be within a 25-mile radius of Boston, MA. The proposed range must meet the following standards to qualify for consideration: 

1.  DHS will provide all AMMUNITION, TARGETS and FIREARMS INSTRUCTORS.

3.  The range must possess a minimum of 10 firing points and must be able to accommodate a qualification course distance minimum of 1.5 yards and maximum of 25 yards. 

4.  The range should have a "turning target system" that can be controlled from a central station, BUT NOT REQUIRED. OFFERORS MUST INDICATE WHETHER OR NOT RANGE MEETS REQUIREMENTS (MUST STATE NUMBER OF YARDS). 

5.  The range shall possess adequate exterior lighting in both public and work areas. 

6.  The range shall be equipped with separate male and separate female restroom facilities indoors with running water located near the range facilities for DHS use.  

7.  The range should possess an on-site facility to accommodate approximately 24 students for classroom instruction and briefing purposes. 

8.  The range must be able to accommodate the following: 9mm, .38, .357, .40, and .357sig caliber Pistol ammunition, and .12 gauge, .223 (5.56mm) and 5.7x28mm rifle ammunition.

9.  The range rules must allow movement between firing points and shall not restrict movement-oriented firearms training by students (e.g. standing to kneeling transitions). The range rules must allow shooters to draw and fire from the holster and from concealment. The range rules cannot disallow a student from moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present, such as tactical move and shoot drills. 

10.  The range backstop/bullet trap must be maintained to provide a safe shooting environment. 

11.  All equipment associated with the range must be in good working order and functional during course of fire (ie., pulleys, target system, lighting, etc.) 

12.  The range shall provide sufficient trash receptacles for used targets, target backers, and empty ammunition boxes. 

13.  The range must possess some type of public address system available during firearms training. 

14.  If an indoor range is offered, it must possess air conditioning, heating, and an approved ventilation system that conforms to existing OSHA regulations.

15.  DHS personnel will use the range an average of 256 hours per quarter. DHS/FPS requires exclusive use of the range for the duration of time, to be reserved in advance, that officers are utilizing the space.  These time periods will not be shorter than 2 hours and not longer than 8 hours, and will be between the hours of 0800 and 1600.

16.  DHS/FPS may re-schedule a range date with 4 days prior notice without penalty.   If a date is rescheduled, the new date will be subject to the availability of the range's existing schedule.

17.  In the event FPS does not make use of 256 hours in one quarter due to scheduling conflicts, the remaining hours may be carried over into the following quarter.

18.  DHS/FPS may request additional range dates as needed, in either 4 or 8 hour blocks, at the agreed upon contract full day or half day contract price, dependent on range schedule availability.

19.  The estimated number of rounds fired per year is 100,000. The range must be closed to the public during the corresponding hours.

The purchasing agency is anticipating awarding a fixed-price purchase order for a twelve-month base period, with two (2) twelve-month option periods.  Interested vendors are asked to submit pricing for each period as separate line items, for a total of three line items.

Additionally, FPS has a requirement for two (2) range memberships, which can be utilized whenever the range is open to its members.  Memberships must be in the name of the Agency, Federal Protective Service, and not in an individual's name.  Vendors should submit pricing for the two memberships for the base period and each option year, for a total of three line items.

Vendors able to meet these requirements are asked to submit pricing for each line item, for a total of six line items.

8.  STATEMENT OF WORK: 
Plase of Performance:  Suisun Bay  Reserve Fleet, Benicia CARadio Alarm Vessel Monitoring SystemStatement of Work (SOW)August 2008
The following defines a vessel-monitoring project for the U.S. Department of Transportation Maritime Administration, Western Region, Suisun Bay  Reserve Fleet in Benicia , California. The vessels in the Suisun Bay  Reserve Fleet are maintained as assets for the Department of Defense and other Government programs. The Statement of Work describes the system and its specifications, component specifications, software specifications, contractor qualifications, installation and delivery requirements, on-site training, and post-installation support requirements determined to be acceptable.
1. DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION
Specification Overview
The Contractor shall provide one (1) radio frequency alarm monitoring system installed at the Suisun Bay  Reserve Fleet, Benicia , California. The radio frequency alarm monitoring system is required to report the occurrence of fire, flooding, electrical current, unauthorized entrance, and unsatisfactory dehumidification and cathodic protection for thirteen (13) ocean-going vessels. Vessel mounted Remote Terminal Units (RTU) will collect data from sensors mounted at various locations throughout the vessel, determine if an alarm condition is present and respond to the alarm by initiating an immediate transmission to the Base Station, or store the data if it is within normal parameters.
The System shall use a quiescent plus polled protocol, whereby the radio system is normally silent except when a vessel mounted RTU detects an alarm or an analog value change below or beyond set points preset by System operators for that sensor. The System shall be polled from the Base Station on a timed basis or on demand. The normal polling procedure will collect maintenance data from each vessel-mounted RTU (battery voltage, sensor status, communication status, current alarm conditions, etc.). An alarm event, defined as a digital sensor trip or an analog value outside of normal parameters, will cause the vessel mounted RTU to initiate an immediate communication to the Base Station. In the event of a communication failure, the RTU will continue to poll the Base Station until it receives an acknowledgement that the data was received. The radio system will use an approved error checking protocol to insure correct data transmission.
The System shall be capable of independently monitoring a minimum of eleven (11) analog and digital or contact closure type sensors. The system shall be capable of expanding to fourteen (14) sensors per vessel. The number of vessels the system can monitor shall be unlimited. The Contractor shall be responsible for furnishing, integrating, and optimizing the system as well as installation, training, and long-term support. 

2. SYSTEM COMPONENTS
1. System Central Controller or Base Station shall consist of the following:
a.	PC station with appropriate display/alarm software installed and configured to depict the harbor, all ships, and significant harbor features and secondarily detail screens depicting individual ships with sensor locations clearly marked.b.	Base Station radio and antenna system integrated to monitoring system-operating software.c.	System Manual with two (2) sets of system "as built" drawings.
2. Remote Terminal Units (RTU) designed to be installed on each vessel to be monitored by the System.           a.	Remote Terminal Units with integrated data radios and power supply. Connections for external power such as AC adapter or solar panel must be available.b.	 RTU's must store a minimum of 24,000 time and date tagged data points.c.	Comprehensive manual covering RTU operations.
3. Eleven (11) analog and digital sensors per vessel designed to monitor fire, flooding, electrical current, unauthorized entrance, and unsatisfactory dehumidification and cathodic protection. 
a. Two (2) temperature (heat) sensors for fire monitoring (4-20 mA, 2,000 F). 	b. Two (2) relative humidity sensors (4-20 mA).	c. One (1) current sensor (4-20 mA) to monitor incoming 3-phase current                                         	    at each vessel.	d. Two (2) infrared intrusion monitoring sensors.	e. Two (2) contact closure flood sensors and mounts.	f.  One (1) relay system capable of monitoring dehumidification machine 	    operations (ON/OFF, starts and runtime)	g. One (1) cathodic protection monitoring sensor
3. REMOTE TERMINAL UNITS-GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS
A Remote Terminal Unit is defined as an assembly including a computer controller device with a display. The RTU will be designed to accept and store analog or digital data from sensors mounted throughout a vessel as well as display the local RTU serial number, current time and date, battery voltage remaining on RTU batteries, real time data for each active channel, and at least 10 historical data points for each active channel on the RTU. The RTU will be operating with an integrated spread-spectrum radio and battery enclosed in a NEMA 4X enclosure. The integrity of the NEMA 4X enclosure must not be compromised by cables or wires coming into the enclosure; it must remain watertight and simple to disconnect and relocate to another ship if desired.
The RTU assembly operates as a vessel mounted data accumulator that transmits data to the base station by being polled at frequent intervals. During normal operations, the Base Station polls any or all Remote Terminal Units for status on a regular operator selectable basis.
4. BASE STATION GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS
A Base Station shall not have sensors connected to it. The function of the Base Station is to display data on each deployed sensor and each RTU equipped vessel's status and to poll vessel mounted RTUs for data. Software selected to display the system data must be an object-oriented program permitting a view of ship locations and major harbor facilities. Vessels must be able to be moved around the harbor using a "click and drag" computer operation. A labeled image of each vessel will visibly and dramatically change in case an alarm is detected on that vessel. On "clicking" any vessel a secondary screen appears depicting that vessel only, which shows each sensor location and type and a dialog window opens detailing the alarm history of that sensor. The software will act as the primary controller for the System and provide for visual and audible local alarms when the conditions warrant them. Both the Base Station PC and software must be integrated with an appropriate data radio.
5. RADIOS
All System radios shall be 900 MHz or 2.4 GHz spread spectrum frequency hopping data radios fully integrated into the RTU and Base Station. System radios shall be capable of continuous operations in conditions appropriate to Benicia , California. Radios selected should be able to act as repeaters to assure RF path to the Base Station.
6. ANTENNAS
Antennas for the System shall be either omni or directional with sufficient gain to assure reliable transmission and reception over the distances required at the Reserve Fleet. 
7. POWER SUPPLY
Each RTU shall have onboard battery capacity to operate without input for at least 24 hours. They must also have an integrated battery charger suitable to maintain a fully charged battery(s) under normal conditions using an AC adapter or solar panel. The RTU shall be wired such that they operate off the battery, not a direct AC connection, as a protection against AC surges. Battery status shall be monitored and displayed for each RTU by the software package. 

8. SYSTEM INTEGRATION, OPTIMIZATION, INSTALLATION AND TRAINING
1. The System Central Controller (MRTU) at the Base Station requires system integration and optimization of the software and hardware. Integration shall consist of proper selection of RTU components and manufacture of RTUs consistent with the requirements of this application along with the software required to operate the system. Optimization shall consist of programming and developing a database tailored to the specifics of the Suisun Bay  Reserve Fleet. 
The Contractor will be provided details of each vessel to be equipped with an RTU sufficient to create the screens defined above.
2. The Contractor shall provide on-site training at the Suisun Bay  Reserve Fleet.  
Training shall consist of:
Sufficient training, to insure that qualified SBRF personnel are capable of installing, improving, testing, and operating the alarm system. This requirement must be part of the deliverable system. This training shall occur during the time the Contractor installs the Base Station, antenna, and the associated equipment and sensors on two (2) vessels. Sufficient training to ensure that qualified SBRF personnel are capable of operating the Base Station PC computer. "Operating" means the ability to poll RTUs, collect data as needed from the System, react to alarms, move ships about the harbor, and create new ships as they come into the Reserve Fleet. 
9. SPEECH SYNTHESIZER/AUTODIALER
An integral solid state analyzer/synthesizer board shall be available that shall accept, digitize and store user spoken speech or other sounds in a minimum 4 Mbytes flash memory for later playback through the synthesizer. The board shall provide high quality natural sounding storage and playback of speech.  At least 12 minutes of 4 kHz bandwidth audio storage shall be possible.  Speech compression methods that degrade speech quality shall not be employed.  A minimum of 254 individual messages shall be addressable, with any message length possible from 0 seconds up to the remaining capacity of the dialer.  Individual messages shall be erasable and recordable without effecting other recorded messages.  Integral software shall be supplied to organize the spoken messages efficiently in memory by user defined message number, prompt the user during the recording process, tag the messages, and enable the messages to be concatenated to form long messages from recorded phrases.  System software shall efficiently manage the flash sectors to avoid wasting flash capacity. With user defined speech, it shall be possible for the unit to repeat previously entered spoken alarm messages and to verbally report analog values and associated engineering units in easily understandable language familiar to the operator.  A touch tone detector shall be provided to enable the unit to respond to tones entered on any touch tone phone.  With this capability and appropriate supplied software, it shall be possible for operators to acknowledge alarms, change set points, enter security keywords, control equipment operation, and trigger spoken reports of station status including spoken reporting of analog, digital or contact closure alarm values such as fire, flooding, electrical current, and unauthorized entrance etc.  The dialer shall be able to report any status or analog value present in the RTU, including those received from remote RTUs.  Alarm acknowledgment shall require touch-tone entry of a security code unique to each operator.
10. Contractor Requirements
The Contractor shall meet the following requirements:

<DESC><p>INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE: The Government intends to award on a sole source bases to the Government of Canada for access to the Data on travel between the U.S. and Canada provided in Statistics Canada.
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration (ITA), Manufacturing &amp; Services, Services, Office of Travel &amp; Tourism Industries (OTTI) provides travel data to public and private industry users. To fulfill this commitment, OTTI produces the Summary of International Travelers to the United States. The Summary is the official Federal government source for international tourist arrivals to the United States. For Canadian visitors to the United States, OTTI relies on Statistics Canada's data runs to provide monthly, quarterly and annual inbound visitor figures from Canada.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada (SC) is the only source of data on travel between the U.S. and Canada, thus, OTTI uses SC's data as the official tourist visitor counts. These data reflect the number of Canadian residents visiting the United States overnight or longer. The data is based on International Travel Surveys administered by Statistics Canada. The use of SC's data prevents duplication of effort by the U.S., thus creating efficiencies and economies of scale. It is these data which OTTI uses to report travel statistics between the U.S. and Canada. It is also from this exclusive source that OTTI obtains data on which to develop the annual report "Canadian Travel to the U.S." This report has been available since 1980.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a statement of technical capabilities which shall be considered by the agency. Information submitted in response to this notice must be in sufficient detail to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement. Responses or questions results from this notice may be submitted via email to Annita Wimbish at Annita.L.Wimbish@noaa.gov, no later than August 13, 2008, no later than 12:00 P.M. noon Eastern Standard Time. Failure to submit documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above. A determination by the Government not to open competition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Part 12 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular.  The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541370 with a small business size standard of $4.5M annual gross receipts for a period of three years.

General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Contracting and Facilities Management Division (PGE), is requesting support services for the Building Information Models (BIM) for the Office of the Chief Architect.     

Background:  In July 2003, the Office of the Chief Architect (OCA) established the National 3D-4D-BIM Program.  To date, OCA has initiated over 70+ capital projects across the nation using an array of 3D, 4D, and Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies in support of GSA business needs.  The power of visualization, coordination, simulation, and optimization from three-dimensional (3D), four-dimensional (4D), and BIM computer technologies allow GSA to more effectively meet customer, design, construction, and program requirements.  GSA is committed to a strategic and incremental adoption of 3D, 4D, BIM technologies (www.gsa.gov/bim).

Project Description
Project Name:  Madawaska Land Port of Entry (LPOE)
Building Type: Land Port of Entry
Location:  Madawaska, ME
Project Phase: Early Design
Approximate Area: 30,000 SF

Project Summary:   The project is for an LPOE facility of approximately 30,000 SF of building program located in Madawaska, Maine.  (See Appendix B).  The existing facility is located on less than 1 acre at the foot of the International Bridge (circa 1926) which spans the St. John River at the location of Madawaska, Maine (pop 7500) and Edmundston, New Brunswick  (pop 20,000).  The site is bounded by the Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Rail Road (RR) which runs parallel to the top of the riverbank, and limits the existing LPOE site to approximately 150’ of width.  Beyond the RR are located two large Fraser Nexfor Paper mills, which bracket Bridge Street as it ascends the hill to connect with US Route 1.  The current existing LPOE facility was constructed in the late 1950’s, and is inadequate to accommodate current processing requirements.

The new facility program will bring CBP operations to current standard of performance, but requires significantly more site area to manage traffic for the multiple layers of inspection operations.  In order to manage this, GSA conducted an extensive search for suitable sites within the vicinity of the bridge.  A 10 acre site was identified approximately 3/8 mile from the bridge, which is the best option available.  The 10 acre site will require traffic to pass along a secure corridor along the riverbank, before passing over an elevated roadway (which will need to be constructed as part of the GSA/CBP project) across the RR right of way, to reach the new site, which is located on a plateau approximately 30’ above the current facility.  A pedestrian processing facility will remain at the foot of the bridge to accommodate extensive pedestrian traffic between the towns and the mills.

A NEPA EIS study for this project was completed in 2007.  

Objectives:  The objectives for this requirement are:

-	To create a BIM(s) that contains a selected population of critical site, architectural,   
structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects for communicating construction sequencing.  The model(s) will support services such as clash detection, and construction phasing.

-	To visualize, communicate, and validate the construction phasing schedule using 4D modeling

-	To assist the GSA in developing Best Practices for the services/applications listed in 
      sections 1.0-2.0 that will be incorporated into GSA’s BIM Guide Series.  It is the 
      intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that 
      future use of BIM for similar applications yields high quality deliverables in the most 
      efficient manner.

Scope of Services:    The following sections describe the services requested through this solicitation.

SCOPE OF WORK

SEISMIC SAFETY IN COMMERCIAL REAL
ESTATE MARKETS

PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE IS A TELECONFERENCE REGARDING THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ON 8/21/2008 AT NOON EST.  

Telephone No.:  	866-614-5160
Participant Passcode:  	7795506



1.0.  Introduction

The General Services Administration (GSA) seeks real estate and engineering analytical expertise to determine the market availability and estimated average costs and total increased costs to leased facilities to the Government (GSA), to meet the “Standards of Seismic Safety for Existing Federally Owned and Leased Buildings”, ICSSC – RP 6, per Executive Order 12941.  

Life-Safety is the minimum acceptable performance objective for federally leased buildings.  According to “Seismic Evaluation of Existing Buildings”, ASCE 31-03, Life Safety Performance Level is defined as:  “Building performance that includes damage to both structural and nonstructural components during a design earthquake, such that: (a) partial or total structural collapse does not occur, and (b) damage to nonstructural components is non-life-threatening.”
 
GSA needs a contractor to determine the average additional costs in 2008 dollars to pay lump sum to retrofit newly leased buildings or lease buildings that meet the Life-Safety requirements of “Standards of Seismic Safety for Existing Federally Owned and Leased Buildings”, ICSSC – RP 6.  (RP 6 can be obtained by visiting http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/build02/PDF/b02006.pdf).
Determine the availability of buildings meeting the above standards and the amount of that space expected to be found in each of the 20 markets (attached)  (Miami is exempt from RP6 since it is located in Region of Low seismicity) versus meeting the current standard of RP-4.   

The contractor shall identify the square footage, the number of buildings, and the percentage of the current GSA lease inventory that meets the baseline RP-4 in each of the 20 markets.  For those buildings in the current GSA leased inventory that do not meet the RP4 standard, the contractor shall identify the total cost in 2008 dollars to pay lump sum to retrofit these buildings to meet the Life-Safety requirements of “Standards of Seismic Safety for Existing Federally Owned or Leased Buildings,” ICSSC – RP 4, (RP 4 can be obtained from the Building and Fire Research Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899).  GSA’s current inventory of leases and lessor contacts is available at www.gsa.gov/leasing (updated monthly).

Assume buildings will be fully occupied during construction.

GSA’s Public Buildings Service maintains a leased space inventory of approximately 8,300 leases with over 164 million RSF.  Approximately one-fifth of the leased inventory expires every year.


2.0.  Scope of Work 

GSA will provide the contractor with a briefing on GSA’s current leased space inventory, detailed information about GSA’s portfolio, including location, size, and other information reasonably required by the contractor.

GSA needs a contractor to determine the average additional costs in 2008 dollars to pay lump sum to retrofit newly leased buildings or lease buildings that meet the Life-Safety requirements of “Standards of Seismic Safety for Existing Federally Owned and Leased Buildings”, ICSSC – RP 6.  (RP 6 can be obtained by visiting http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/build02/PDF/b02006.pdf).
Determine the availability of buildings meeting the above standards and the amount of that space expected to be found in each of the 20 markets (attached).  (Miami is exempt from RP6 since it is located in Region of Low seismicity) versus meeting the current standard of RP-4.   


The contractor shall identify the square footage, the number of buildings, and the percentage of the current GSA lease inventory that meets the baseline RP-4 in each of the 20 markets.  For those buildings in the current GSA leased inventory that do not meet the RP4 standard, the contractor shall identify the total cost in 2008 dollars to pay lump sum to retrofit these buildings to meet the Life-Safety requirements of “Standards of Seismic Safety for Existing Federally Owned or Leased Buildings,” ICSSC – RP 4, (RP 4 can be obtained from the Building and Fire Research Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899).  GSA’s current inventory of leases and lessor contacts is available at www.gsa.gov/leasing (updated monthly).

Determine the average total cost (structural cost, nonstructural cost, design fee, testing, etc. and management costs) of buildings located in Moderate High and Very High levels of seismicity (per FEMA Seismic Rehabilitation Cost Estimator (visit: www.fema.gov/srce/index.jsp ) for the areas shown in Table 1.0, to meet the standards of RP-6. 

The contractor shall also present the per square foot cost across the GSA leased inventory.   

The contractor will determine rental rates for GSA “standard space that meets RP-4” and the rental rates for RP 6 compliant space in each of the 20 markets or MSA’s (attached), where GSA is most active and an estimate of the cost to meet these standards in all of GSA’s leased locations, Miami is exempt from RP6 since it is located in Region of Low Seismicity.  If the contractor is unfamiliar with GSA’s lease requirements, we will provide the contractor with a copy of a SFO using a Tenant Improvement rate of $35.00 per square foot.  The contractor will also provide to GSA, the costs per square foot of design, construction, and all other costs to make standard buildings compliant with RP-6 in those markets.  The contractor will develop estimated average total costs per square foot for leased buildings using a performance measure that will consider the geographic market, the type and class of space, the pricing dynamics (rate, term, concessions, etc.) within the 20 markets where GSA is most active, and the type of procurement, e.g., new and succeeding. 

 The goal is to identify the rental premium per square foot and measure the cost effectiveness of the:
•	transaction,
•	portfolio of transactions over the year, 
•	roll up the aggregate “relative value” of the inventory’s rent rates as compared to the market overall, and
•	Per square foot cost within the inventory.

The data in this study shall be done to at least a 95% confidence level. 

3.0. Deliverables

A memorandum defining the action plan of how the contractor will meet the goals and objectives of this study is due one week after the notice to proceed.

A 60% draft report (five bound copies and five electronic copies Adobe PDF format) and presentation to GSA at a location to be determined (TBD) is due 8 weeks after the notice to proceed.

The 90% draft report (five bound copies and five electronic copies in Adobe PDF format) and presentation to GSA in TBD is due 2 weeks after approval of the 60% report. 

The final report (ten bound copies and five electronic copies in Adobe PDF 
format) and final presentation to GSA in TBD is due 2 weeks after approval of the 90% report.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Part 12 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541370 with a small business size standard of $4.5M annual gross receipts for a period of three years.

General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Contracting and Facilities Management Division (PGE) , is requesting support  services for the Building Information Models (BIM)  for the Office of the Chief Architect.     

Background:  In July 2003, the  the Office of the Chief Architect (OCA) established the National 3D-4D-BIM Program.  To date, OCA has initiated over 70+ capital projects across the nation using an array of 3D, 4D, and Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies in support of GSA business needs.  The power of visualization, coordination, simulation, and optimization from three-dimensional (3D), four-dimensional (4D), and BIM computer technologies allow GSA to more effectively meet customer, design, construction, and program requirements.  GSA is committed to a strategic and incremental adoption of 3D, 4D, BIM technologies (www.gsa.gov/bim).

Project Description:
Project Name:  San Luis 2 Land Port of Entry (New Construction)
Building Type: Land Port of Entry (border station)
Location:  San Luis, AZ
Approximate Area:  Roughly 30,000 gsf spread among several small buildings, and approximately the same amount of additional square footage in the canopy areas.  
Year Built: Under construction, anticipated completion September 2009.

Project Summary:    This project is construction of a new land port of entry (border station) on the Arizona border with Mexico.  

The current GSA Computer Maintenance and Management System (CMMS) does not adequately capture the required equipment information necessary for the effective management and operation of its facilities.  GSA has a desire to enhance its building information database with this information to create a more robust and effective building management environment, enabling coordinated commissioning activities and facility management (e.g., maintenance schedules, maintenance coordination, mechanical operation, etc.) across building life-cycle phases.  


The phase of work covered by this solicitation is limited to creation of a mechanical, electrical and plumbing model, and population of applicable fields during the construction process as submittals identify specific products and installation details.  GSA shall provide a spatial program BIM, developed through Final Concept, as a basis for the MEP model.


Objectives:  The objectives for this requirement are:

-  To create a BIM(s) that contains a selected population of critical mechanical, electrical, and plumbing objects for building services such as HVAC, BAS, and Lighting that may be utilized for building design, construction, and operation.  The model will support services such as spatial validation, clash detection, and building operations and maintenance activities.  The model shall include several buildings within the Land Port of Entry.

-  To populate the critical mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects with the appropriate performance requirements and as-built information.  The object attribute information that is captured will be used throughout the building lifecycle and integrated into the GSA CMMS (which is an in-house developed application).  Systems integration with the GSA CMMS is not part of this scope.

-  To assist the GSA in developing Best Practices that will be incorporated into GSA’s BIM Guide Series.  It is the intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that future use of BIM for similar applications yields high quality deliverables in the most efficient manner.	

Scope of Services:   The following sections describe the services requested through this solicitation.  The contractor shall coordinate and seek approval from the GSA COTR regarding the equipment object types, elements, element attributes, and zones to be modeled (these are defined later in this section).  Information on the specified equipment object types, elements, and element attributes, to be modeled will be provided to the contractor directly by GSA COTR as that information becomes available.  All services listed below include the support of development of best practices guidelines for the GSA BIM Guide Series.

This BIM Scope of Work will be a Firm Fixed Price Contract.

1.0	Base Services

The contractor shall provide a BIM of the following components outlined in 1.1-1.7, using the existing spatial validation BIM as a starting point.  The contractor shall properly use available “object information” that embody information about the building component requirements and properties (e.g., construction materials, functional information, dimensions, etc).  Contractor shall coordinate with GSA to determine which buildings to model.
GSA shall provide the contractor with the 100% Construction Document AutoCAD files, the spatial validation BIM, and applicable MEP submittals (in either PDF or hard copy).  Submittals will be provided as they become available during construction.  Contractor shall assume that a Final Concept spatial program BIM (i.e., architectural and structural BIM) is available as a starting point.   

Contractor shall coordinate with GSA COTR to determine the exact mechanical, electrical, and plumbing objects to model.  

1.1.	Site 3D Model/BIM
The contractor shall provide a 3D model and/or BIM of the surrounding landscape, extending to the boundaries of the Port of Entry.

1.2.	MEP BIM

The contractor shall provide a MEP BIM that models the major object types for these disciplines.  Contractor shall model MEP objects both within each building, between buildings, and entering the site.  Contractor shall coordinate with GSA COTR to determine which objects to model in BIM.  Contractor shall assume 30 object types shall be modeled.

Example object types are:

Mechanical: package units and other heating/air conditioning units, pumps, fans, ducts, controls, etc.

Electrical: electric panels, fluorescent lighting, fiber optics cables, cable trays,
conduit, feeders, fire alarms, etc.

Plumbing: sprinkler systems, storage tanks, pumps, supply piping, transformers, gas lines, water supply piping, etc.

1.3.	Modeling of Required Building Equipment Attributes (Performance Requirements)

The contractor shall populate the building elements modeled with equipment information that captures the performance requirements specified by the design team.  In addition to the basic properties of name/description, dimensions, location, National CAD Standard acronym and OmniClass classification, an average of 15 equipment attributes (e.g. hp, gpm, rpm, power factor, etc.) should be anticipated for each object.

1.4.	National CAD Standard
To ensure stability and conformity throughout the life cycle of all assets and repairs, the GSA desires to create a standard system of acronyms based upon the National CAD to identify equipment.  The contractor shall coordinate with the GSA COTR to obtain the appropriate acronyms for the building equipment modeled.  This information will be included in the list of attributes that is assigned to the required building elements.

1.5.	OmniClass
The OmniClass Construction Classification System (known as OmniClass or OCCS) is a new classification system for the construction industry developed by the Construction Specification Institute (CSI).  It builds upon MasterFormat for work results, UniFormat for elements, and EPIC (Electronic Product Information Cooperation) for structuring products. OmniClass is a reference library that will serve as the foundation upon which information is transferred between the BIM, COBIE, and GSA’s CMMS (see Section 6.0). The contractor shall include the appropriate OmniClass classification in the list of attributes that is assigned to the required building elements. The contractors(s) shall coordinate with the GSA COTR to ensure the correct application to OmniClass to the modeled elements.

1.6.	Construction Operations Building Information Exchange (COBIE)
The Construction Operations Building Information Exchange (COBIE) is a buildingSMART initiative of the National Institute of Building Science’s (NIBS) Facility Maintenance and Operations Committee, the Facility Information Council, the International Alliance for Interoperability, and the National Building Information Model Standard. It is a federal government sponsored effort to support the development of BIM via information exchange between the construction and operations phases.  COBIE has several functions.  First, it serves as a repository for important equipment information, as does the BIM model.  Second, it allows for the collection and management of electronic construction submittals in various file formats, and enables the owner to ensure that the performance requirements for the project have been met.

The contractor shall coordinate the appropriate equipment information from the BIM with the COBIE system. As construction as-built data is submitted to COBIE by the general contractor, the BIM services contractor shall update the appropriate equipment attributes in the BIM model. The contractor shall coordinate with the GSA COTR to ensure the correct coordination between the BIM and COBIE.

Equipment information from COBIE and the BIM will be transferred directly into the GSA CMMS by the GSA facility management team.  The contractor will coordinate with the facility management team to ensure the information to be transferred is complete and in the correct format.

General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Contracting and Facilities Management Division (PGE), is requesting support services for the Building Information Models (BIM) for the Office of the Chief Architect.     

Background:  In July 2003, the Office of the Chief Architect (OCA) established the National 3D-4D-BIM Program.  To date, OCA has initiated over 70+ capital projects across the nation using an array of 3D, 4D, and Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies in support of GSA business needs.  The power of visualization, coordination, simulation, and optimization from three-dimensional (3D), four-dimensional (4D), and BIM computer technologies allow GSA to more effectively meet customer, design, construction, and program requirements.  GSA is committed to a strategic and incremental adoption of 3D, 4D, BIM technologies (www.gsa.gov/bim).

Project Description: 
Project Name:  White Oak CUP  
Building Type: Central Utility Plant
Location:  White Oak, MD
Approximate Area: 50,000 GSF
Year Built: Became operational in 2003


Project Summary:   The White Oak CUP currently provides electric and hot water for the CDER laboratory and CDER Office.  This is a mechanical equipment building.  The Spatial Data Management (SDM) project is a national initiative of the GSA/ Public Buildings Service (PBS) to measure federally occupied space in its facilities, capture the information in a graphical database, establish business processes, and maintain the accuracy of this data over time.  The SDM project seeks to physically verify (measure and classify) the PBS space inventory and capture and maintain the resultant CAD libraries that shall be used as PBS's single trusted spatial data repository.  In addition, the SDM project records and maintains accurate agency assignment data.

GSA would like to perform a comparative study between traditional SDM techniques and deliverables, versus a BIM-based method utilizing laser scanning.  In addition, current GSA procedures do not adequately capture required equipment information necessary for the effective management and operation of its facilities via GSA Computer Maintenance and Management System (CMMS).  GSA has a desire to enhance its building information database with this information to create a more robust and effective building management environment, enabling coordinated commissioning activities and facility management (e.g., maintenance schedules, maintenance coordination, mechanical operation, etc.) across building life-cycle phases.  

Objectives:  The objectives for this requirement are:

To create an accurate current-condition record of the existing building conditions.  The deliverables from the interior scanning will be used primarily for verification and comparison of spatial data and area measurements.  The 3D imaging at this location will provide 2D CAD plans, elevations and 3D geometric models and/or BIM required to document as-built conditions, including details of the interior spaces. 

-  To generate a point cloud of the building interior and exterior for applications such as spatial data management, visualization, and facility management.	

- To create a BIM(s) that contains a selected population of critical architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects for building services such as Fire, HVAC, Data/Communications, Security, and Lighting that may be utilized for building operation.  The model(s) will support services such as spatial validation and building operations and maintenance activities.

- To populate the critical mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and civil objects with the appropriate performance requirements and as-built information.  The object attribute information that is captured will be used throughout the building lifecycle and integrated into the GSA CMMS.

- To assist the GSA in developing Best Practices for the services/applications listed in sections 1.0-7.0 that will be incorporated into GSA’s BIM Guide Series.  It is the intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that future use of BIM for similar applications yields high quality deliverables in the most efficient manner.	

Scope of Services:   The following sections describe the services requested through this solicitation.  The contractor shall coordinate and seek approval from the GSA COTR regarding the equipment object types, elements, element attributes, and zones to be modeled (these are defined later in this section).  Information on the specified equipment object types, elements, element attributes, and zones to be modeled will be provided to the contractor directly by GSA COTR as that information becomes available.  All services listed below include the support of development of best practices guidelines for the GSA BIM Guide Series.

This BIM Scope of Work will be a Firm Fixed Price Contract.

General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Contracting and Facilities Management Division (PGE), is requesting support services for the Building Information Models (BIM) for the Office of the Chief Architect.     

Background:  In July 2003, the Office of the Chief Architect (OCA) established the National 3D-4D-BIM Program.  To date, OCA has initiated over 70+ capital projects across the nation using an array of 3D, 4D, and Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies in support of GSA business needs.  The power of visualization, coordination, simulation, and optimization from three-dimensional (3D), four-dimensional (4D), and BIM computer technologies allow GSA to more effectively meet customer, design, construction, and program requirements.  GSA is committed to a strategic and incremental adoption of 3D, 4D, BIM technologies (www.gsa.gov/bim).

Project Description: 
Project Name:  United States Custom House Envelope Repair 
Building Type: Custom House
Year Built:  1934
Location:  Downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Project Phase: The project is currently in the Programming Phase.  The Programming Phase will last approximately through October 2008.

Project Summary:    The United States Custom House was completed in 1934 and is seventeen-stories in height.  The building consists of a three-story base, stepping back to raise 14 additional stories as a cruciform tower.  Many decorative elements adorn the exterior of the building including eagles, shells, and sea creatures, symbols of the government, commerce, and maritime history.  There are a total of 8 different roofs and 1050 windows.  The Custom House is presently being considered to be named a national historic landmark. 

On the whole, the United States Custom House, which stands prominently in the oldest section of Philadelphia, is one of the best preserved and elaborate 20th century federal buildings in the city.  It represents a grand gesture to modernism, while relating to the scale and streetscape of the old city.

Base Building

The square, three-story Indiana limestone base of the Custom House is composed of two primary elements defined by the treatment and massing of the masonry and windows.  The lower base of the building extends from ground level to the masonry sill of the second story windows (Appendix A – Figure 1).  The masonry below the sill of the first floor windows is granite, while the remaining portion of the lower base is clad in seven courses of rusticated limestone blocks that are chamfered at the edges, which make the joints appear almost two-inches wide.  The massiveness of the lower base is accentuated by the deeply recessed arched window and door openings.  

Above and juxtaposed to the more massive lower base at the first-story is the visually lighter and attenuated upper base, which extends two stories high.  The second and third floors are configured as a single story by using ashlars limestone units with narrow flush joints, punctured by two-story-high steel window units.  Soapstone spandrel panels between the two stories, some carved with marine figures, appear to be integral to the window and screen the floor behind them.  A limestone parapet terminates the base of the building.  A carved limestone parapet and cornice caps the center and corner pavilions, while the areas in between are capped by a limestone parapet and cornice with brick inlay panels.  The seal of the United States is carved in the parapets at the center pavilions; while garland draped shields decorate the parapets at the corner pavilions.

The three-story base with projecting center entrance pavilions and secondary corner pavilions, of one bay each, is nearly identical on the North, East, and West Elevations.  The north and main entrance pavilion, facing Chestnut Street is the most prominent pavilion.  It consists of three arched door openings adorned with an eagle keystone above the arch.  Large aluminum relief panels fill the recessed arched openings.  In the center opening is the allegorical figure of America with an eagle, buffalo, and torch.  The east relief panel is a ship with nautical tools depicting American industry, while the west relief panel illustrates American agriculture.  

Flanking the three entry doors on the North Elevation are large freestanding, eight foot-high decorative octagonal aluminum lanterns.  

The Center Pavilions on the East and West Elevations are similar to the primary North Center Pavilion, but feature only one arched entry door with five windows above.  The seal of the Treasury Department with draping floral garlands adorn each arched doorway.  Smaller, wall-mounted octagonal aluminum lanterns flank the sides of these secondary entrances.  The aluminum relief panel in the west doorway depicts Asian culture and industry, while the relief panel on the east side represents European culture and industry.  

The South Elevation, designed as a loading dock, differs from the other elevations at the lower base only.  Between the corner pavilions is a wider, one-story, pavilion with seven arched entryways for vehicles.  The one-story pavilion is capped with a limestone parapet with brick inlay panels.

Lower Tower

Above the three-story base, the building step back and raises 14 additional stories as a cruciform tower.  The first and widest recessed blocks are two stories high, while the second and tallest rises six stories, and terminates in a parapet wall just above the 12th Floor (Appendix A – Figure 1).

Brick is the principal cladding material, but a central, slightly projecting limestone facing on the cardinal facades creates a bold white vertical skyscraper form that rises from the base of the building and extends continuously to the terra cotta sections and lantern at the top of the building.  The verticality of the tower form is juxtaposed to the wide horizontal limestone band at the tenth and eleventh floors which repeats and mirrors the bold horizontal limestone band at the base of the building with arched openings.  The eleventh floor consists of a limestone arcade of Romanesque windows with a limestone balustrade.  The tenth floor consists of a horizontal limestone belt course with brick, punctuated with octagonal-framed limestone bull’s eyes or port holes, consistent with the nautical theme repeated throughout the building.

Upper Tower/Lantern

Above the 12th floor, the building steps back again in brick, with terra cotta used as the contrasting white material.  Originally, the terra cotta was almost identical in color to the limestone (Appendix A – Figure 1).

The upper tower is octagonal in plan with setback roofs.  In addition to the main (top) roof, there are five continuous setback roofs.  On the north, east, south, and west elevations there is an additional setback roof at the 15th floor.

At the 12th Floor is a terra cotta balustrade adorned with large ball finials and large winged terra cotta eagles at the corners.  The next setback raises two stories high with projecting terra cotta pavilions.  The two story-high window openings accentuate the verticality of the terra cotta spire.  The pavilions are capped with terra cotta parapet walls with ornate frieze panels and large urns.  Above the 15th floor rises the three-part terra cotta lantern with diagonal terra cotta tracery, a garland decorated frieze and large ball finials on the cornice.

Scope of Services

Objectives: The objectives for this requirement are: 

-  To create an accurate current-condition record of the existing building conditions and assist in the repair and alteration work throughout its design process.  The 3D imaging at this location will provide 2D CAD plans, elevations and 3D geometric models and/or BIM required to document as-built conditions, including details of the roof.  The elevations will assist architecture and engineering firms in developing their restoration and renovation designs. 

-  To generate a point cloud of the building exterior for applications such as archival, visualization, and site planning.

 -  To assist GSA in developing 3D Imaging Best Practices that will be incorporated into GSA’s BIM Guide Series.  It is the intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that current and future 3D imaging yields high quality deliverables in the most efficient manner.

The COTR will carry out inspections, reviews and approvals, handle deficiencies, and ultimately accept on behalf of the Contracting Officer.  The functions of the COTR are identified below.  Government personnel, other than the Contracting Officer and the COTR, from time to time, may observe the contractor’s operations.  However, these personnel may not interfere with contractor performance.

9.2.  General Quality Assurance Functions. To facilitate the surveillance of the Contractor’s Quality Control (QC) Program by the Government, the COTR will verify contractor compliance with designated contract performance requirements through a series of random; announced/unannounced; and, impromptu/scheduled inspections.  The COTR will review the critical requirements to assess their applicability and recommend the addition or deletion of requirements as conditions warrant.  In addition, for noncompliance and/or untimely corrective action to deficiencies of specific tasks, the Contractor shall be subject to re-performance (at the company’s expense); and/or an inspection fee; and/or a reduction of the Contractor’s payment. With this intent, the COTR’s surveillance approach may not be one that stays the same throughout the duration of the contract.  The COTR will periodically update the surveillance approach when the need arises.  The COTR will inspect the contractor’s QC Plan regularly for compliance with the requirements herein.

9.3.  Specific Quality Assurance Functions:   The COTR will establish an Inspection Schedule using the Quality Checklists from the Contractor’s QC Program. The COTR will perform the following Qualitative and Evaluative functions, which comprise the Government Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP).  

	a.  Carry out periodic inspections using the Quality Checklists to evaluate contractor performance to ensure compliance and receipt of services.  The COTR will evaluate the contractor’s performance through intermittent on-site inspections of the contractor’s QC Program and receipt of complaints from base personnel. The COTR may inspect each task as completed; increase the number of quality control inspections if deemed appropriate because of related failures discovered during quality control inspections or because of repeated customer complaints; or, decrease the number of quality control inspections if performance dictates. 

b.  Report findings resulting from these inspections to the Contractor and the Contracting Officer. 
If discrepancies are discovered as a result of the periodic inspections, or any other means, the COTR will use a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR) to communicate them to the contractor and follow up to ensure nonconformance’s are corrected.  When a discrepancy exists, the contractor shall complete the applicable CDR blocks. The Contracting Officer will evaluate the contractor’s explanation and determine the next course of action.

c.  Perform monthly reviews of the contractor’s reports and records to ensure they adequately reflect the proper schedules.

d. Review changes as well as initial and annual equipment inventories.

	e. The COTR will meet at least twice a week with the Contractor’s on-site working supervisor during the first month of the contract.  Thereafter, meetings will be scheduled monthly by the COTR or as often as necessary.  The COTR will prepare written minutes from these meetings that shall be signed by the Contractor’s on-site working supervisor and the COTR.  Should the Contractor not concur with the minutes, the Contractor shall state any areas of non-concurrence in writing to the COTR within 5 calendar days of receipt of the signed minutes.  Meeting minutes will be maintained in the COTR contract file.

f.  Take appropriate actions based on Health/Safety/Environmental/any other inspection results.

g.  Conduct periodic customer surveys. The validated surveys will be compared to the requirements stated herein; and, follow up to ensure customer surveys conducted by the contractor are conducted properly and contractor responds fully to concerns. The COTR will also receive and investigate complaints from various customers located on the installation. The contractor shall be responsible for initially validating customer complaints. However, the COTR will make final determination of the validity of customer complaint(s) in cases of disagreement with customer(s).

h.  Perform Annual and Final Performance Evaluation on the Contractor.

9.4.  Service Delivery Summary (SDS):  The contract/PWS service requirements are summarized into the following Performance Objectives, whose thresholds are critical to mission success:

9.5.  This comprises the Government’s QASP, which has been developed to evaluate contractor actions while implementing this PWS; and, is designed to provide an effective surveillance method of monitoring contractor performance for each listed Performance Objective on the SDS.  The QASP provides a systematic method to evaluate the services the contractor is required to furnish.  This QASP is based on the premise the government desires to maintain a quality standard for this service contract.  The contractor, and not the government, is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract.  The role of the government is quality assurance to ensure contract standards are achieved.

The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerors are listed in order of importance: (1) Technical Conformance to Specifications, (2) Price including Freight/Shipping Costs. The technical evaluation will include examination of the product literature and technical features for conformance with the requirements of the Specification Document. Evaluation of products will be on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating obtaining any information not identified in the offer.  An offer that does not provide sufficient information which describes their capacity to meet the RFQ’s technical evaluation criteria can result in failure of this evaluation factor. Offers should clearly identify the item by manufacture name, make model number and include descriptive literature such as illustrations and drawings, etc. to clearly demonstrate / describe the product meets the requirement of the specification document. Offerors may propose early or a staggered delivery schedule for large quantity orders based on plant capacity which will be considered during the quote evaluation. The offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer.  The government will evaluate on offer that proposes a Contractor’s date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding one work day for award or notice transmitted electronically.  (The term “work day” excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) Quotes may be submitted on company letterhead stationary and must include the following information: Solicitation Number, Nomenclature, Part Number, Unit Price, Extended Price, Payment Terms and discount offered for prompt payment. Quotes may be F.o.b. Destination, or F.o.b. Origin, Freight Prepaid quotes must include shipping prices for the purpose of evaluating quotes to determine lowest in overall cost to the Government.

<DESC>The above referenced solicitation is being amended to answer technical questions:

1.

Question:

What area is to be covered, and are you looking for spatial resolution of
any kind?

Answer:

We need to measure the ion energy at the center of the electrode.  There
is no need for spatial resolution (i.e., no need to measure at any other
positions.)

2.

Question:

Is NorCal a manufacturer?


Answer: 

NorCal certainly is a manufacturer. 

The complete name of the apparatus is the Gaseous Electronics Conference Radio-Frequency
Reference Cell.  (It is also known as the GEC RF Reference Cell or simply the 
GEC Cell.)  It was designed by a committee of scientists from the Gaseous
Electronics Conference to serve as a standardized platform for plasma research.
There are more than 30 copies of the cell that have been built and are in use
by scientists across the US and around the world.

<DESC>The following are responses provided to questions that have been received pertaining to this solicitation. 

1.Under the Sample Task it says “Below is a sample of estimated costs for the ACME meeting.” Yet there are no costs listed.   In the Scope of Work it states that NIST will provided the projected costs for each task order.  Please provide the projected costs for the sample task.

A. The following are sample costs used for the purpose of this solicitation : 
Abstract Books            $1,500                       
Loose leaf binders         $  640                   
Printing & Duplicating    $1,200                    
NIST Conference Programs  Fee (per person)   $45 per person
NIST Admin Fee (per person)   $  5 per person


2)Under the Scope of Work it states that “the contractor will be required to assess, electronically collect, and account for registration fees from the conference attendees and exhibitors, and submit conference revenue to NIST, as appropriate.”  In previous discussions w/NIST Conferences it was indicated that the contractor would not be providing NIST with revenue (i.e writing a check payable to NIST), rather the contractor would be paying the bills at the hotel, for example.  Can you confirm this?  

A. It is not clear what is meant by “in previous discussions w/NIST Conferences” but please note that the Contractor will be billed by NIST for Conference Program labor provided by NIST staff and other expenses incurred.

3)It is also mentioned that the fees the contractor collects would have to “cover NIST’s expenses associated with the conference, the contractor’s expenses associated with the conference and the contractor’s profit.”  Can you confirm that “NIST’s expenses are the same as the direct costs (i.e. catering, AV, etc.)

A. Labor will also be charged as well as other direct costs such as but not limited to, printing, transportation, etc.)

4)I noticed that mention of posters and printing was removed from the solicitation.  Am I to assume that NIST will handle these tasks?

A. Printing will be provided by NIST to the Contractor and the contractor will be billed by NIST.

5) Solicitation Number NB107000-8-00107 seems to indicate that all contractor expenses for conferences are only reimbursed through conference registration fees and that no funds are provided by NIST.  A. This is correct, “no funds will be provided by NIST.

6) Is the contractor responsible for providing necessary conference expenses for hotels, audio visual, etc. prior to obtaining registration fees?  
A. Yes, a deposit may be required as well as other expenses and the contractor is required to provide them.

7) Does NIST provide any funds for conference expenses other than what is collected from registration?  

A. A sponsor of the conference may offset the registration fees with contributions which will not come from NIST.

8) Is it the contractor’s responsibility to obtain enough conference attendees to cover expenses and contractor profit or are there set lists of expected attendees?

A. NIST provides mailing lists for meetings.  The contractor may be asked for marketing assistance.

HSAR 3052.209-70     PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006).
(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of
Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity
which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the
Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 	(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:

(End of provision)
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

                                                    Commandant (G-APO-1))
                                                    Jemal Building, 11Street
    1900 Half St. SW, 
    Washington, DC 20590
                 Telephone: (202) 475-3454  
      Fax:  (202) 475-3904

Closing date and time for receipt of offers is AUG 25, 2008, 3:00 p.m., EST.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.  Anticipated award date is on or about SEP 08, 2008.  Contact Danny Sawyer at Danny.R.Sawyer@uscg.mil  or 252-335-6561 for questions regarding this solicitation.

Approximate value is estimated at $3M per year.

b) The intent is to award a contract to maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational institution, JHU/APL.  JHU/APL’s core competencies include (but are not limited to) designing, development, and prototyping of space systems; analysis and evaluation of space systems and space-related date; and research and development of systems that provide characterization of the space environment, situational awareness, accurate discrimination, and targeting of threat objects.

c) As a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC), JHU/APL shall assist SMC/SYSW (and STRATCOM, AFSPC, and similar agencies) with the technical assessments, systems & program integration, and strategy & concepts development supporting the Space Control mission area.   Further, the fundamental application of this UARC expertise will be to establish concepts for maintaining US mission capability in the face of varied threats by leveraging all space, air, terrestrial, and cyber elements that can be integrated into a solution. Aspects of this effort will include projecting and red-teaming possible threats, developing mitigation across all domains and across all applicable systems with the specific goal of identifying weaknesses in current mission sustainment that result from stovepiping.

d) This contract will support the analysis of systems, capabilities, and concepts within the Space Control mission areas of Counterspace (CS), Space Situation Awareness (SSA), and space Command and Control (C2).  This contract will ensure maximum leverage of developed capabilities, consistency in assessment approach, long-term continuity, and short-term responsiveness to requirements for critical analysis that refines and expands upon work performed to date by APL.  In addition to program support via papers and studies, ongoing support includes the development of an “end-to-end” ISSA system modeling and simulation capability. This contract will permit the Government to efficiently ensure the mission areas are fully integrated and there is sufficient continuity with one contractor for the Government to realize maximum benefits.

e) The Government needs to maintain analysis consistent with the current approach without interruption and substantial duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through competition.  The current analysis approach includes developing and maintaining a Concept Development Testing Environment (CDTE) that provides for Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)-free access for industry contractors to demonstrate and test potential new DCS and SSA products.  APL’s structure provides for a relatively OCI-free environment, critical to handling proprietary data.

f) Space Protection Program (SPP) – JHU/APL shall assist SMC/SYSW (and STRATCOM, AFSPC, and similar agencies) with technical assessments, systems & program integration, and strategy & concepts on the emerging space protection mission area.  Provide Subject Matter Experts for requirements and capabilities studies, intelligence and physical analysis of vulnerabilities (attack modalities) of spacecraft systems, sensors, and ground systems, as well as cyberspace and information assurance domains. Provide threat characterization, assessment of vulnerabilities due to technology advancements, and development of countermeasures may include signature characterization, signature and detectability models, developing operational guidance, and prototyping systems, technologies, or TTPs.

g) Simulation and Modeling – JHU/APL shall provide simulation and modeling of selected concept designs across all disciplines of space systems. This includes space phenomenology, cyberspace, threat analysis/effects, space segment performance, operations, ground segment interfaces, terrestrial systems and their implications, cross-mission CONOPS, and enterprise-wide mission capability sustainment to include US government assets, civil/commercial assets, and foreign assets.

h) All interested parties can submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC) no longer than 10 pages and containing the following information: technical description of the offeror’s experience and knowledge of Air Force Space Command space control systems, Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and architecture; description of facilities and equipment intended for use in support of this effort; proof of security clearances for government evaluation; and their OCI strategy to maintain an OCI-free environment.  In addition, they shall include their plan to insure separation of contractor’s proprietary data.  Interested parties must have experience with analysis of Air Force Space Command military systems and capabilities, to include development of analysis software and tools, and must have detailed knowledge of Air Force Space Command space control systems, capabilities, and their operations across all mission areas (DCS/SSA/C2).  They must also have knowledge of the intelligence community processes, systems, capabilities, operations.    To mitigate schedule risks, interested parties must have strong experience with ongoing efforts and developments in space control and must be ready to initiate or continue analysis and products immediately upon contract award.  

i) All interested parties must be cleared to handle government equipment and information up to, and including TS/SCI/SAR and have personnel with current TS/SSBIs as well as a Top Secret - SCI accredited SCIF.  SOCs should be sent to SYSW/PK, Attn: David Kessler, 483 North Aviation Blvd. El Segundo, CA 90245-2808 or e-mailed to david.kessler.ctr@losangeles.af.mil and received by 4:00 P.M, PST, on 15 Aug 2008.  Submittals that contain classified materials must be coordinated with either the primary or secondary points of contact.  No contract award will be made on the basis of SOCs received in response to this notice.  The NAICS code for this announcement is 541712 with the applicable size standard of 1,000 employees.  Any business in this area of expertise will be allowed to participate in the submittal of SOC’s.  Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.  However, all businesses must be capable to support operations pertaining to the description of services at the time of submitting SOC’s.  

BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this proposed acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this proposed acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of SOCs for this proposed acquisition. The Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill, phone number (310) 653-1789.  Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the primary or secondary POCs (See 5. or 6. above for contact information).

<DESC>This is an announcement of an US HHS/FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) streamlined competition. FDA is conducting a streamlined competition in accordance with OMB Circular A-76, dated May 29, 2003. This A-76 cost comparison study will examine the possibility of converting Government "in-house" operations to contractor operations. A cost comparison to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the following services and related functions performed by Government personnel to contract performance will be conducted. 

The competition will include those services that are currently performed in Silver Spring, MD and Rockville, MD.  Services being competed include general analytical and administrative support activities. Typical functions to be performed include document and correspondence preparation, communications, meeting support, budget support, inventory, office automation, FOI support, public health support, timekeeping, device safety, office support and special projects. Approximately 56 Full Time Equivalent positions are affected by this competition.  

The Competitive Sourcing Official for HHS is Joe Ellis. Ruth McKee is the Agency Tender Official. The FDA Contracting Officer is Patricia Pemberton, patricia.pemberton@fda.hhs.gov. 

This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract. Prospective offerors are advised that a solicitation will not be issued if the cost of contract performance is determined to be greater than the cost of in-house performance by Government personnel. No solicitation exists at this time. The solicitation will be made available on the Federal Business Opportunities if and when it is released. The projected end date is on or before November 30, 2008.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION, NO SOLICITATION SHOULD BE ANTICIPATED, AND PROPOSALS ARE THEREFORE NOT REQUESTED

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services (OAGS), Division of Acquisition Operations (DAO) has a requirement for the evaluation of Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) class 3 drugs for possible biowaivers.  BCS characterizes drug substances based on their aqueous solubility and intestinal permeability.   
These properties, in addition to dissolution, control the rate and extent of drug absorption from immediate release, solid oral dosage forms.   According to BCS, drug substances may be categorized as follows:  Highly soluble, highly permeable (Class 1); poorly soluble, highly permeable (Class 2); highly soluble, poorly permeable (Class 3); and poorly soluble, poorly permeable (Class 4).  Currently, an FDA guidance published in August, 2000 (BCS guidance), provides for waiver of in vivo bioequivalence studies for drugs determined to have BCS Class 1 properties, provided they are rapidly dissolving and not NTI drugs.  This approach has allowed the approval of numerous new and generic drugs based on in vitro data alone, with tremendous savings in resources and reduction in unnecessary human testing.  It is believed, with the appropriate testing, that biowaivers may be extended to drugs belonging to BCS Class 3.  Such biowaivers could also result in significant savings to the drug industry and the American health care consumer.     

This contract shall evaluate a number of commonly used excipients for possible impact on the permeability and absorption of several BCS Class 3 drugs.  In vitro as well as confirmatory in vivo studies shall be conducted.  The results could support extending biowaivers to drug products in this class.

100% Full and Open Competition

The NAICS code is:  541712.  

It is anticipated that one (1) cost type contract is expected for a one (1) year period of performance. 

The solicitation and any documents relating to this requirement will only be available through the internet at:  www.fedbizopps.gov .  Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring Fed Biz Opps for the release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  Contractors are encouraged to sign-up on the fedbizopps.gov website, for email notification of all actions relevant to this solicitation, and on the interested vendors list, also listed at the bottom of this announcement.  


Responses to this Request for Proposal (RFP) package will be due approximately 30 days following the actual date of issuance of the RFP.  Award of this requirement is anticipated by September 19, 2008.
