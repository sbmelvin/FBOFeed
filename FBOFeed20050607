<CONTACT>Mary Funk, Small Business Representative, Phone 509-372-9522, Fax 509-372-9049, Email mkfunk@bhi-erc.com - Mary Funk, Small Business Representative, Phone 509-372-9522, Fax 509-372-9049, Email mkfunk@bhi-erc.com
<DESC>The following description summarizes the scope of work for remedial action of the 100-IU-2 and 100-IU-6 operable unit waste sites.  Remedial action will involve the excavation of radioactive and hazardous soil and debris and the packaging of this material into shipping containers.  After loading, the containers will be sealed and placed in a transfer area for pickup by others.  Construction debris and process equipment may require size reduction prior to loading.  Miscellaneous waste such as drums, bottles, tanks or vessels may require repackaging and special handling prior to shipping.  Oversized debris may require size reduction to facilitate waste loading.  This work is considered to be hazardous in nature and will require personnel to have OSHA 40-hour and applicable radioactive worker training.  

The work includes performing remedial design and construction activities, and furnishing necessary facilities, equipment, labor, materials, supplies, and tools.  Remedial design includes engineering services to prepare “issued for construction” (IFC) drawings to locate and detail the various waste sites and structures that may impact excavation activities, proposed support areas (e.g., laydown areas, support facilities, air monitors), and engineering support during field activities.  This work also includes constructing and maintaining container transfer areas and haul roads.

This work scope includes performance of operations necessary to excavate, segregate, size reduce, stage above cleanup level and stockpile below cleanup level materials, containerize, load (direct loading if approved by CONTRACTOR), weigh, and transport materials from the waste sites to the container transfer areas.  This includes container tarping and maintenance, on-site access control, and housekeeping.  In addition to contaminated soil, structural materials, metal debris, and other miscellaneous debris, this work scope includes performance of operations and incidentals for the handling, processing, and staging of buried drums (if found), and industrial hygiene monitoring.

A wide range of chemically contaminated soil, miscellaneous debris, buried equipment, and structural materials may be encountered during remedial action activities.  Radiologically contaminated soil or debris is anticipated at two of the waste sites (600-108, 600 111).  Therefore, the successful Offeror shall have the appropriate experience and trained personnel to perform work operations in different levels of personal protective equipment, including supplied air for radiological, chemical, or general unknown conditions.

The estimated subcontract value for this work is between 10 and 15 million dollars.  Following award, mobilization, submittals, and readiness assessment, field work is anticipated to span between Fiscal Year 2006 and Fiscal Year 2008.

Potential bidders will be required to complete a pre-qualification questionnaire located at http://www.bhi-erc.com/Opportunities/DoingBus/90-day.htm  For questions please

The US Fish and Wildlife Service has a requirement to  mow pinnate tansymustard weeds (Brassicaceae) on 1,300 acres of acquired properties at Stillwater NWR.  Western Nevada experienced an unusually wet spring leading to an incredible growth of mustard on the old farm properties acquired by Stillwater NWR under our Water Rights Acquisition Program. Time is of the essence as the rapid appearance and extent of infestation of the Tansymustard, an invasive non-native weed species is growing rapidly and we need to mow the entire 1,300 acres before it sets seed.  Mr. Rechels is the only farmer in the area who has the proper equipment and has expressed a willingness to do the work.

<DESC>CDC is part of an Early Detection Research Network (EDRN). The goal of the network is to identify and validate molecular signatures of incipient neoplasias so as to allow specific intervention early in the development of disease and improve cancer survival.  
	 
The CDC project is a study of preinvasive and invasive cervical lesions in the high-risk urban population of women referred to the colposcopy clinic at the University of Michigan Cancer Center because of abnormal cervical cytology.  CDC in collaboration with University of Michigan Cancer Center has successfully established the infrastructure for specimen and data collection and has created a biorepository for the discovery and validation of cervical neoplasia early detection and risk assessment markers.  

CDC intends to issue solicitation no. 2005-N-01885 as a non-competitive contract to the University of Michigan to expand the EDRN biorepository for cervical neoplasia and to conduct short and long-term studies to validate putative biomarkers for cervical cancer detection and risk assessment in clinical settings.  The epidemiologic study design for biologic sample and data collection will continue to focus on high-risk populations attending public health colposcopy clinics but will be expanded to include HIV-positive women, increase ethnic diversity, and add women with invasive cervical disease.  Enrolled women will be followed two years to provide follow-up needed to assure precision in disease ascertainment and evaluate biomarker change in response to therapy.

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1. The NAICS code for this solicitation is 541710. Solicitation will be posted on or about June 30, 2005.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, sources who believe that they can meet the requirements should provide proof of their ability via email trouthmurphy@cdc.gov. Only email will be accepted from potential sources.

<DESC>This Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) whose purpose is to extend the ordering and performance periods for the Reconnaissance, Intelligence Ground Systems (RIGS) Products and Services (RPS) Contracts with Lockheed Martin Corp. (F19628-97-D-0008) and Raytheon Corp. (F19628-97-D-0009). The Contracts ordering period will be increased by (3) years, from ending 31 December 03 to 31 December 06. The Contracts period of performance will also be increased by (3) years, from ending 31 December 04 to 31 December 07. This change will not increase the ceiling price of the two Contracts. The extension is a contract action required to provide for the acquisition of upgrades to existing  Subsystems, Ground Control Processor (GCP) and Deployable Ground Intercept Facility (DGIF), which were developed and fielded by the aforementioned Contractors, as parts of the Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS). The anticipated upgrade candidates planned for functional integration into the two Subsystems, are Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT) and Advanced Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP). The NCCT Program goal is to demonstrate initial concepts of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) platform collaboration over a common network to expedite persecution of time sensitive targets. Formation of initial concepts is scheduled thru 2005. The ASIP Sensor Program is a development effort centered on providing a near-term SIGINT capability on-board Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Its development period will proceed thru 2007. The scope of the subject RPS Contracts scope is concerned with ground-based ISR solutions, similar to the planned upgrades. The Government intends to contract with Lockheed Martin and Raytheon as the only holders of RPS Contracts under authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) (A) and (B), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements"  This notice does not constitute a request-for-proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to an acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Reference Note 22.

This presolicitation announcement is not a contract, or a request for proposals, or a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind.

The PAAS acquisition strategy has not been finalized at this time. The AF anticipates soliciting for these requirements in July/August 2005.     

Conference participants will not be allowed to use recordable media, cell phones, palm pilots, laptops, etc. during the sessions.

Additionally, visitors may be required to go through a security screening check point on the base. 

If you plan on attending the Presolicitation Conference, the only gate for visitors is the gate at Henderson Court (which is off South Presa Street or Old Corpus Christi Road).   Due to construction, there is no access on Southwest Military Drive for non-government ID card holders.

Effective January 1, 2005, all offers are required to complete Section K, Representations and certifications by logging onto http://orca.bpn.gov as part of the proposal submission process .   You are required to key in your DUNS# and MPIN to gain access to the representations and certifications.  Your MPIN is the nine digit code containing one alpha character and one number (no special character or spaces).  The MPIN is created, by you, in your company CCR record when your CCR registration has been completed.  You can add your representations and certifications and update using this site.  It is the offerors responsibility to ensure data is up to date at all. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.   Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced.   To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).   The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent  information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.   Offerors may submit signed and dated offers by facsimile to 202-353-7794 to the attention of Bid Custodian, by any available express mail service or hand delivery to 400 First Street NW, Washington, DC 20534.

All offerors must complete the Business Management questionnaire in Section L of solicitation document with three references.   References must be for same or similar items.  Offerors who have not done business with UNICOR shall complete the ACH form, which can be found on UNICOR’s webpage.  A completed ACH form must be on file prior to contract award as well as verification of registration in the CCR database. If you have not registered in the CCR you may do so by logging onto www.ccr.gov and click on start new registration.  Offerors can obtain a copy of the ACH form by logging onto www.unicor.gov, Business Commercial Opportunities, Navigate to, Scroll down to Procurement forms, click on ACH Form, print and return completed form with written proposal.  Effective January 1, 2005, all offers are required to complete Section K, Representations and certifications by logging onto http://orca.bpn.gov as part of the proposal submission process .   You are required to key in your DUNS# and MPIN to gain access to the representations and certifications.  Your MPIN is the nine digit code containing one alpha character and one number (no special character or spaces).  The MPIN is created, by you, in your company CCR record when your CCR registration has been completed.  You can add your representations and certifications and update using this site.  It is the offerors responsibility to ensure data is up to date at all times.   ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.   Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. 
Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced.   To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).   The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent  information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather 
information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.  Offers received after the exact time and date specified will not be considered.  The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the government.   The following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals: Specification, Past Performance, and Price.  Descriptive Literature: Offerors are required to submit Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) with written proposal of the product they are offering.   If your firm fails to submit MSDS with the written proposal,  your offer will not be considered for award.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer will be mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  The solicitation will be available on UNICOR’s website at www.unicor.gov and eps.gov on or about June 9, 2005.  No copies of the solicitation will be mailed.  All responsible offerors may submit an offer, which will be considered.

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/ OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per  the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

	1.  Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary to order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contracts, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified to each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and include item (d), as necessary:

a.	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license, at a minimum, shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor’s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitted; and

b.	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

c.	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

d.	A Valid picture state driver’s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBA documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously, or at the time of pick up, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2.  Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter, as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

	3.  Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for what specific time thereafter, as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

	4.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractors record copy, at the time of Release of Claims, to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>PROSPECT MOUNTAIN FUELS REDUCTION STEWARDSHIP The project area includes 20 acres of an approximately 2500 acres of mixed conifer (Douglas Fir, sub-alpine fir and lodgepole pine) forest on Little Prospect mountain.  The project area is approximately 34 miles northeast of Farson Wyoming, 45 miles east of Pinedale, Wyoming, 74 miles north of Rock Springs, Wyoming, and 100 miles southwest of Lander, Wyoming.  These stands are currently overstocked, resulting in poor tree vigor, declining forest stand health, are currently experiencing bark beetle damage and high levels of hazardous fuel loading.  Present conditions are a departure from the historic healthy forest ecosystem, due in part to fire exclusion.  The risk to damaging stand replacement by fire is high.  There is one residence (WUI) adjacent to these stands. The prescription calls for removing standing dead and down and any live trees exhibiting bark beetle infestation.  Ladder fuels and slash will be lopped and scattered.  All products are intended for fuel wood use (biomass).  The prescription also will require that 3 to 5 large standing dead trees be left per acre to support the habitat needs of cavity nesting birds.  The estimated value of service work is $3000 and the value of products is estimated at $4500.  BLM is offering this project as an equal exchange of the thinning service with the value of the product removed.  The estimated minimum volume of fuel wood is 45 cords. Geographic Description:  South-central Wyoming.  The project is located approximately 225 miles north of Salt Lake City, Utah and 180 miles west of Casper, Wyoming. Benefits:  Reducing hazardous fuels and improving forest health benefits all species endemic to forested habitats.

Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/ .  The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and fo! r commercial firms.

The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past perf! ormance.

The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, Florida intends to issue a modification to contract N61331-05-C-0029 with Intermed Video Technologies of Newtown, CT. for the procurement of one (1) additional 17” flat panel display and three (3) each 10.4” flat panel displays. This contract modification is required because fleet deployments have significantly increased and an additional LCAC has been identified to undergo an upgrade of its radar and navigation systems. This requirement was only recently defined and was not known at the time the procurement quantities for contract N61331-05-C-0029 were established.  This item is only available from Intermed Video. Currently the flat panel displays, originally manufactured by Intermed Video, have been installed on some of the non-SLEP LCACs (pre-LCAC 61) and one of the NDI replacement LCACs (LCAC 61 and above). These displays, as previously installed, are integrated into the SLEP navigation hardware and software that will ! form the basis for the NDI replacement gear. Any other displays would require extensive testing and qualification costs, and duplicating the logistics train established for the non-SLEP LCACs. Intermed Video, as the OEM, is the only known source for this equipment. NAICS 33411 applies. FSC Code 5820.

THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO ISSUE THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL PACKAGE N62467-05-R-0057 ELECTRONICALLY ON OR ABOUT WEDNESDAY, 08 JUNE 2005 WITH THE PROPOSALS DUE ON FRIDAY, 08 JULY 2005. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: The Government shall set-aside and restrict competition for this procurement to 8(a) firms in SBA Region IV (Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Kentucky, and South Carolina) and 8(a) firms that have a bona fide place of business location in Region IV.   This procurement is for one solicitation resulting in the award of one firm-fixed price construction contract. The 100% Plans and Specifications Request For Proposal procedures will be utilized for this procurement.  This project consists of the construction of the proposed library at Shaw AFB, Sumter, South Carolina.    The work includes, but is not limited to the construction of a new 16,500 SF Base Library.  The new Library will be constructed with a reinforced concrete foundation and floor slab on shallow spread footings with load bearing, reinforced CMU walls with a brick veneer.  The roof system will be a sloped pre-finished standing seam metal roof system installed over rigid insulation on structural metal deck and metal roof framing.   Interior partitions will be gypsum wallboards and the new Library will have aluminum windows with laminated glazing.  The work includes communication and fire protection systems, all supporting utilities, and site work consisting of parking, sidewalks, access drives, and landscaping.  This project has been designated for sustainable design.  As a measure of sustainable design efforts, this project is participating in the United States Green Building Council’s LEED Green Building Rating System.  The contractor shall comply with LEED criteria and fulfill all requirements to obtain a minimum LEED certification level for this project.  NOTE:  Obtaining a minimum LEED certification is a bid option. The estimated cost for construction of the project is between $2,800,000 and $3,100,000.  The construction will consist of two phases: Phase One is Mobilization and Submittals.  Phase Two is the construction of the new Base Library.  Phase One will have a maximum duration of 60 calendar days.  Phase Two will have a maximum duration of 365 calendar days.  The Contracting Officer will issue two separate Notices to Proceed (NTP).  The first NTP will cover Phase 1 and consist of Mobilization and Submittals.  The Contracting Officer may issue this NTP within fourteen  - (14) calendar days after award.  This phase shall not exceed sixty –(60) calendar days from date of contract award.  Phase 2 Construction shall begin when the Contracting Officer issues the second NTP.  The Contracting Officer may issue the second NTP within forty-five (45) calendar days after issuance of the first NTP.  
This solicitation is formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the construction selection procedures of FAR 36. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merits and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal.  This procurement will result in an evaluation of offerors based on evaluation factors that include (1) Past Performance, (2) Technical Qualifications, and (3) Technical Approach.  If necessary, a competitive range determination will be made for this solicitation which will be based on technical and price factors and will include all of the most highly rated proposals unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency.  For evaluation purposes only in determining the competitive range, the Government will calculate the total price proposal as the sum of the project.  After a competitive range determination is made and final proposal revisions (if necessary) are received, a best value award decision will be made.  Offerors are required to submit technical and price proposals for the project.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals for the project will not be considered for an award.  The Government will award the project based on the most advantageous combination of price and technical factors that result in the overall best value award to the Government.   If discussions are required, they will be conducted with each offeror in the competitive range.  At the conclusion of discussions, each offeror still in the competitive range will be given an opportunity to submit a final proposal revision.
Price and the overall technical rating are of equal weight for the award. RFP ISSUE DATE: The Government intends to issue the Request For Proposals (RFP) electronically by posting it on the NAVFAC website, www.esol.navfac.navy.mil, on or about June 8, 2005. A pre-proposal conference and site visit will be held within two weeks of issuance of the RFP at Shaw AFB.  The exact date, time, and location will be stipulated in the RFP.  Proposals will be due around July 8, 2005. The exact date will be stipulated in the RFP.  Offerors must register themselves on the Internet at www.esol.navfac.navy.mil.

Task Orders will primarily consist of new construction, roofing, demolition, routine renovation and repair of facilities and infrastructure including: 1) aviation and aircraft facilities, 2) marine facilities, 3) barracks and personnel housing facilities, 4) administrative facilities, 5) warehouses and supply facilities, 6) abatement and handling of hazardous/regulated materials (including and not limited to asbestos, lead paint and PCBs), for the Area of Responsibility (AOR) of ROICC Key West, FL.Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that will result in awards based on BEST VALUE to the Government, price and other factors considered. Each contract will be for one base year with four one-year options.  The total 5 year (base year and 4 option years) estimated construction costs for all of the IDIQ contracts is NTE $30,000,000. Projects will vary in size from around $100,000.00 to $3,000,000.00. The minimum guarantee is $25,000.00 for each contract. If a minimum of two (2) offerors remain in the pool during contract duration, this will satisfy the competitive requirements and preclude the necessity of soliciting for a replacement contractor if for any reason one of the contracts is terminated or one of the offerors is excluded from participation in the process.  This procurement will include potential award for two (2) 8(a) eligible, HUBZone eligible or Service Disabled Veteran eligible contractors.  These contractors will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II.  If an 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the contract will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such. The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features. Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state.  

Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven (7) proposers (design-build teams), unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than seven (7) is in the Government’s interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of two-phase design build contracting. The narrowing phase is based on design-build factors that include:  Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Experience, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), and Management Approach.  Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five (5) year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects (new construction and renovation) including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, abatement and handling of hazardous/regulated materials (including and not limited to asbestos, lead paint and  PCBs), and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.

Otherwise eligible 8(a), HUBZone, and Service Disabled Veteran contractors are invited to participate on an unrestricted basis as appropriate.   If the successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction.  Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope/design options with the Government’s published budget for award. The offeror with the best value proposal for the seed project will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD AT LEAST FIVE CONTRACTS.  THE OFFERORS PROVIDING THE HIGHEST RATED BEST VALUE.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Columbus is soliciting interested Parties to participate in this Unrestricted Commercial Part 12 Solicitation, for spare parts to be used on AM General Weapons Systems.  The scope of this contract includes all DLA managed items for which AM General is an approved source or that they have supplied in the past. Items within the scope may be added to the solicitation or any resulting contract(s) at a later date.  

This acquisition will result in Firm-Fixed-Price, Indefinite-Quantity Contracts for delivery to stock only.  The initial contract period will be two years with one three-year fixed-price option period.  The estimated two-year base period value is $12,008,947.54, totaling $30,022,268.85 with option. 

FSCs include the following:

FSC	FSC	FSC	FSC	FSC
1005	2815	3950	5895	5999
1010	2910	4030	5905	6625
1095	2920	4320	5930	
2510	2930	4330	5935	
2520	2940	4710	5945	
2530	2990	4720	5961	
2540	3010	4730	5962	
2590	3020	4820	5980	
2805	3040	4910	5985	

Submission of solicitation pricing will be phased – approximately 100 NSNs every 30 days, prioritized by demand and whether or not the NSN is identified for Reset*.  Phased pricing will allow all vendors the opportunity to offer on as many NSNs as possible.  The Government may make multiple awards (maximum two for each NSN) by NSN where high-density items cannot be supported by a single source of supply.  However, this will ultimately be determined by the competition received.  An all or none clause is not included.  

For NSNs resulting in a single award, the managing activity will issue delivery orders by means of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), using the conventions and formats prescribed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI X12) and the Department of Defense (DoD) Implementation Guidelines.  The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will be using a Distribution Point with connections to several Value Added Networks (VANs) for passing transactions to vendors in ANSI X12 format.  Supplies will be ordered using the following EDI Transaction Sets:  

(1)	Transaction Set 850 – Call/Order
(2)	 Transaction Set 810 - Invoice

To determine the offeror(s) that provide the best value to the Government, the Agency will use the trade-off process (instead of the lowest priced technically acceptable source selection process).  

Access to a complete list of NSNs and P/Ns included on this solicitation can be downloaded from: http://www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/corporate_contracts/cc.asp on the date of issue.  It is impracticable to distribute the applicable drawings with the solicitation, however, they will be available at <http://dibbs.dscccols.com/rfp>.   If the drawings are not posted at this web site, see Clause L11D02Availability of Drawings for information on how to obtain the drawings.  FEDERAL, MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL SPECIFICATIONS CANNOT BE PROVIDED BY DSCC.

*Reset is a major effort to "repair and refit" Army and Marine Corps units that have recently returned from deployment. It involves bringing more than 20,000 wheeled and 3,000 tracked vehicles, every aviation system in Southwest Asia and 300 different command and control systems to a condition where they can be reissued for use by units replacing soldiers redeploying from Iraq or be used to fight another conflict anywhere in the world. The Marine Corps Reconstitution effort, while smaller in scale, is equally important.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Description:      PLEASE NOTE:


NAICS CODE SHOULD READ: 541330 ENGINEERING SERVICES NOT 541310 ARCHITECTURAL SERVICES


CONTRACT INFORMATION:  The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Indiana requires the services of an Architect-Engineering (A-E) firm for design of agrichemical handling facilities.  Engineering services are required for the preparation of plans, specifications, cost estimates, related studies, and all associated engineering services for the design and construction in various locations throughout Indiana.  Construction activities will include construction inspection, checkout, and certification.  

This acquisition process is being conducted in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  THIS PROCUREMENT IS UNRESTRICTED and is therefore open to all businesses regardless of size. The primary North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541330.  This announcement constitutes the only notice.

PROJECT INFORMATION: 

The government contemplates the award of two to five Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts resulting from this competition. Contracts may be issued up to twelve months after selection approval and will be issued based on the order of ranking of the firms by the selection board.   The number of contracts that will be issued will be dependent on the amount of work that will be required.   The initial contract period will be from date of award through September 30, 2005 and the government may, at its option, extend the contract until September 30, 2009 by exercising each of the four one year renewal options. 

Work under each of the contracts will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders.   Funding for these contracts is through the NRCS EQIP program.  It is anticipated that a maximum of $50,000 will be available during the initial contract period and up to $500,000 for all task orders in total for each option year of the contract.  This amount, however, may vary from year to year with no guaranteed amount.  The price of any single task order shall be at least $1,000 but shall not exceed $500,000. The cumulative value for all task orders for the contract period will not exceed $2,050,000.  Task Orders will be negotiated as firm fixed-price procurements.

Task Orders are expected to include civil, agricultural, and or environmental engineering services and other services as needed for preliminary investigation, design, and construction supervision of the defined project.  Services requested may require performing (1) field investigations; (2) engineering surveys; (3) geologic and soils investigations, (4) design and preparation of engineering plans and construction specifications, (5) construction layout and certification of completed practices in accordance with NRCS policies, standards, specifications and handbooks. The construction and design documents prepared under these contracts shall be produced in electronic format conforming to approved NRCS computer software.  All drawings will be submitted using AutoCAD, version 2000 or later or other similar CAD software that is directly convertible to AutoCAD.  

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Those firms that meet the requirements described and wish to be considered must submit THREE copies of Standard Form 330 for prime and any proposed sub-consultant to the Contracting Officer, Natural Resources Conservation Service, 6013 Lakeside Boulevard, Indianapolis, IN 46278.  Limit your SF 330 along with supporting data for a total package of not more than 75 pages, 8x11 paper, 12 pitch.  Pages in excess of this maximum limit shall be removed from the proposal and will not be evaluated by the selection board.

Please indicate the solicitation number on the outside of your package. All responses received within 30 days after this publication will be considered for selection.   Any incomplete responses or responses received after this time will not be accepted and will be returned to the offeror.

The SF-330 must clearly indicate: (1) the office location where the work will be performed and the qualifications of the individuals and subcontractors proposed to work on the contract showing all disciplines including but not limited to civil, agricultural, environmental and geotechnical engineering, nutrient management planning and application, as well as their geographical locations; (2) the Offeror’s proposed sub-consultants showing their disciplines and their qualifications as well as their geographic locations; a description of the offeror’s facilities, materials, equipment and services to be used  to perform the type of tasks described by this notice; a customer reference list with addresses and telephone numbers, and bidding records (low bid vs. estimate) for all projects listed as related experience;  a project workload schedule showing proposed team members for the project period; and, Offeror’s must have a Registered Professional Engineer on staff that is licensed in the State of Indiana to certify all drawings that will be prepared by the Offeror.  Submit the name and registration number of this individual.

Firms responding to this announcement before the closing date will be considered for selection, subject to any limitations indicated with respect to size and geographic location of the firm, specialized technical expertise, or other requirements listed.  Selection of firms for negotiation shall be through an order of preference based upon demonstrated competence and qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the type of professional services required. 

All firms responding to this announcement will be evaluated on the following factors (included in descending order of importance): (1) experience with similar types of projects in the Midwest states; (2) experience with NRCS methods, standards and specifications, TSP process; (3) past performance on contracts with government agencies and private sector (relevant projects shall not be more than 5 years old); (4) location in general geographical area of the project and demonstrated knowledge of the locality of the project; and, (5) professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance.

Prior to the final selection, firms considered highly qualified to accomplish the work may be interviewed either by telephone or by formal presentation. 

If two or more firms are selected; the top ranked firm will be awarded the first contract, the second ranked firm will be awarded the second contract, etc.  If necessary, secondary selection criteria will be used as a tiebreaker between two firms considered technically equal.  Individual task orders may be competed among the contract holders and not necessarily given to the top ranking firm.

In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a federal contract. For information regarding registration, contact the CCR Web Site at www.ccr.gov. 

The FAR now requires that prospective contractors complete electronic annual representations and certifications in conjunction with their required registration in the CCR Database.  These Annual Representations and Certifications are submitted via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), a part of the Business Process Network (BPN). To register in ORCA, you need to have an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record, a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) from your CCR record, and know your DUNS number.  Detailed information regarding ORCA and how to submit records is available on the ORCA website at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help and FAQs.  You also have the option of entering the SF 330 Part II information directly into ORCA.  Please indicate in your submission package if you have done this.  
 
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT BE PROVIDED.  Forms may be obtained at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/zero.

Facsimile transmissions will not be accepted.  Solicitation packages are not provided and no additional project information will be given to firms during the announcement period.

The work includes communication and fire protection systems, all supporting utilities, and site work consisting of parking, sidewalks, access drives, and landscaping.  This project has been designated for sustainable design.  As a measure of sustainable design efforts, this project is participating in the United States Green Building Council’s LEED Green Building Rating System.  The contractor shall comply with LEED criteria and fulfill all requirements to obtain a minimum LEED certification level for this project.  NOTE:  Obtaining a minimum LEED certification is a bid option. The estimated cost for construction of the project is between $2,934,000 and $3,260,000.

This solicitation is formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the construction selection procedures of FAR 36. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merits and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal.  This procurement will result in an evaluation of offerors based on evaluation factors that include (1) Past Performance, (2) Technical Qualifications, and (3) Technical Approach.  If necessary, a competitive range determination will be made for this solicitation which will be based on technical and price factors and will include all of the most highly rated proposals unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency.  For evaluation purposes only in determining the competitive range, the Government will calculate the total price proposal as the sum of the project.  After a competitive range determination is made and final proposal revisions (if necessary) are received, a best value award decision will be made.  Offerors are required to submit technical and price proposals for the project.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals for the project will not be considered for an award.  The Government will award the project based on the most advantageous combination of price and technical factors that result in the overall best value award to the Government.   If discussions are required, they will be conducted with each offeror in the competitive range.  At the conclusion of discussions, each offeror still in the competitive range will be given an opportunity to submit a final proposal revision.
Price and the overall technical rating are of equal weight for the award. RFP ISSUE DATE: The Government intends to issue the Request For Proposals (RFP) electronically by posting it on the NAVFAC website, www.esol.navfac.navy.mil, on or about June 8, 2005. A pre-proposal conference and site visit will be held within two weeks of issuance of the RFP at Shaw AFB.  The exact date, time, and location will be stipulated in the RFP.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Columbus is soliciting interested Parties to participate in this Unrestricted Commercial Part 12 Solicitation, for spare parts to be used on AM General Weapons Systems.  The scope of this contract includes all DLA managed items for which AM General is an approved source or that they have supplied in the past. Items within the scope may be added to the solicitation or any resulting contract(s) at a later date.  

This acquisition will result in Firm-Fixed-Price, Indefinite-Quantity Contracts for delivery to stock only.  The initial contract period will be two years with one three-year fixed-price option period.  The estimated two-year base period value is $12,008,947.54, totaling $30,022,268.85 with option. 

FSCs include the following:

FSC	FSC	FSC	FSC	FSC	FSC
1005	2815	3110	4720	5930	5995
1010	2910	3120	4730	5935	5999

2590	3020	4330	5895	5980	
2805	3040	4710	5905	5985	

Submission of solicitation pricing will be phased – approximately 100 NSNs every 30 days, prioritized by demand and whether or not the NSN is identified for Reset*.  Phased pricing will allow all vendors the opportunity to offer on as many NSNs as possible.  The Government may make multiple awards (maximum two for each NSN) by NSN where high-density items cannot be supported by a single source of supply.  However, this will ultimately be determined by the competition received.  An all or none clause is not included.  

For NSNs resulting in a single award, the managing activity will issue delivery orders by means of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), using the conventions and formats prescribed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI X12) and the Department of Defense (DoD) Implementation Guidelines.  The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will be using a Distribution Point with connections to several Value Added Networks (VANs) for passing transactions to vendors in ANSI X12 format.  Supplies will be ordered using the following EDI Transaction Sets:  

(1)	Transaction Set 850 – Call/Order
(2)	 Transaction Set 810 - Invoice

To determine the offeror(s) that provide the best value to the Government, the Agency will use the trade-off process (instead of the lowest priced technically acceptable source selection process).  

Access to a complete list of NSNs and P/Ns included on this solicitation can be downloaded from: http://www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/corporate_contracts/cc.asp on the date of issue.  It is impracticable to distribute the applicable drawings with the solicitation, however, they will be available at <http://dibbs.dscccols.com/rfp>.   If the drawings are not posted at this web site, see Clause L11D02Availability of Drawings for information on how to obtain the drawings.  FEDERAL, MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL SPECIFICATIONS CANNOT BE PROVIDED BY DSCC.

In order to receive drawings for this solicitation you must be JCP certified.  If you do not have a JCP certification number, go to the following web address and download the application, “Military Critical Technical Data Agreement” DD FORM 2345.

Fill out the form following all instructions and mail form to address shown in Battle Creek MI.

*Reset is a major effort to "repair and refit" Army and Marine Corps units that have recently returned from deployment. It involves bringing more than 20,000 wheeled and 3,000 tracked vehicles, every aviation system in Southwest Asia and 300 different command and control systems to a condition where they can be reissued for use by units replacing soldiers redeploying from Iraq or be used to fight another conflict anywhere in the world. The Marine Corps Reconstitution effort, while smaller in scale, is equally important.

Constructive simulation, virtual simulation, and capabilities analyses support  services are sought for the Simulation and Analysis Facility (SIMAF) and  ASC/XR. The ASC/XR Mission is effects-based planning to maximize efficiency in  delivering war-winning capability. XR provides planning interfaces across the  aeronautical enterprise and to MAJCOM and HQ AFMC processes. Collaborative  modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS+A) is seen as a key enabler of  capabilities analyses and integration as well as system-of-systems (SoS)  concepts for future capabilities.  The SIMAF is a secure facility capable of operating through the full range of  security classifications.  Contractor personnel will be required to have the  appropriate level of clearance to meet day-to-day operational requirements.   The scope of simulation efforts within the SIMAF spans weapons systems  acquisition life cycles, from conceptual to developmental phases through  sustainment, and may be executed in segregated or integrated air-to-air, air- to-ground, and surface-to-air environments as specified by the government.   Typical requirements are constructive simulation studies, virtual simulation  studies, human system integration studies, distributed simulation events, and  support for simulation events that may include live testing or direct test.   Five support functions structured as Performance Based Services are  anticipated for FY06 thru FY10. Firms may propose one (except for E below  which must be proposed in concert with at least one other area), two, three,  four or all functions (approximate functional percentage of total effort is  shown as percentage): A)	Capabilities Development and Integration (software development) (30%)  Typical areas of software development include, but are not limited to  simulation specific code, weapons SoS network architectures, interfaces and  protocols; computer system network architectures, interfaces and protocols;  and data analysis software.  For more detail see Functional Area appendix in  PIXS Library. B)	Event Planning, Development and Execution (15%),  Includes support simulation event planning, development, and execution  activities which include, but are not limited to: coordination and/or  assistance with software, database, and scenario development activities,  analysis activities, and simulation hardware support activities. For more  detail see Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. C)	Simulation Analysis (20%) Typical analysis activities associated with constructive simulation studies,  virtual simulation studies, distributed simulation events, and support for  simulation events that may include live testing or direct tests.  Analyses  areas of interest include, but are not limited to survivability, lethality,  mission effectiveness, interoperability assessments, systems of systems  architecture, and human system integration. For more detail see Functional  Area appendix in PIXS Library. D)	Facility and Simulation Hardware Support (30% includes 15% Material  Purchases) The Simulation and Analysis Facility is a secure classified facility, which  will require the following Facility support functions: Operational Support;  Hardware Buildup; Facility Preparation; Hardware/Operator Interface (See the  Functional Area appendix in the PIXS library). The Government will require the contractor(s) to provide support for the SIMAF  Road-shows including equipment procurement, shipping, set-up, show support,  and teardown. SIMAF will require various commercially available software and  hardware to be purchased to sustain its daily facility and simulation  operation. The Material to be procured will include: Computer Hardware,  Cockpit Hardware, Simulation Systems, Visual and Graphic Display Systems,  Computer Networking Equipment, Communications Systems. For more detail see  Functional Area appendix in PIXS Library. E)	Enterprise Capabilities Integration Process Support (5%) ASC/XR strives to leverage MS+A techniques across aeronautical enterprise  processes.  Both General Support and specific Project Support efforts are  anticipated under this functional area. General Enterprise support consists  of  participating in Integrated Analysis Team meetings, the Aeronautical  Enterprise (AE) IPT, ASC/XR Capabilities Integration Board (CIB) meetings,   the Aeronautical Enterprise Steering Group (AESG), analytical planning support  to I-CRRA Action Items or Objectives, Cost Estimating capabilities toolsets,  architecture product (e.g. OV-1) validation, participation with OEMs thru  Wright Brothers Institute (WBI), etc. Project specific efforts likely to be  tasked thru task order might include participating in project System  Engineering Working Group (SEWG) and other MS+A related project working group  meetings,  assisting in development of project specific analysis plans to  include the appropriate mix of constructive, virtual, and hardware in the loop  simulations, etc. , assisting in development of program management plans, test  plans, etc, for project specific requirements,  working with specific projects  in developing Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) support plans,  assisting in  planning and executing assessments of competing conceptual approaches for a  specific project such as support to a government source selection. The acquisition strategy currently contemplates a 60-month effort with a three- year CORE effort incrementally funded and two one-year options and Customer  Event Task Orders.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements Time and Materials  (T+M) type contract is contemplated.    The estimated level of effort for this contract is approximately 78,000 labor  hours for the first year, increasing by 10 percent per year thereafter for a  total three year CORE effort of approximately 258,000 labor hours. The two  option years have an estimated 90,000 labor hours each. Customer events will  be supported using task orders.  Collaborative analysis involves significant challenges in protection of  intellectual property and classified information. Associate contractor  Agreement clauses will be utilized in each functional area contract that XR  awards. An Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) clause 5352.209-9002 is  anticipated to be necessary to emphasize the restrictions that will be levied  upon recipients due to the need to protect Proprietary Information and  Intellectual Property of other contractors. Individual employees  will be required to execute a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).   A Top Secret facility/personnel security level will be required.  Top Secret  clearances will be required for 50% of the staff at time of contract award.   All personnel must be capable of receiving a Top Secret clearance, although  they are not expected to be necessary for everyone at this time.  All  personnel will be required to hold a Secret clearance.  Foreign firms should  be aware that restrictions apply which could preclude their receipt of any  resulting contract.  ITAR restrictions apply in performance of these  contracts.  To determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award,  foreign-owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or  technical point of contact before submitting an SOC.  Submit only unclassified  information for consideration and evaluation.  Statements of Capabilities (SOC) Organizations having capabilities in military operations research Modeling,  Simulation and Analysis (MS+A), computer simulation requirements definition,  exercise and test planning and implementation in a simulated environment, and  scenario generation for large scale distributed simulations are invited to  submit a SOC by 17 Jun 2005 for consideration.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior,  National Business Center (NBC) has a potential requirement for a software package that provides the ability to: 1.  Support the development of system and project performance goals. 2.  Perform alternative IT solutions analysis for comparison purposes. 3.  Integrate IT systems user (client) business impact benefits with IT system costs. 4.  Easily vary data inputs to assess the impact of change requests. 5.  Load and integrate financial analysis data at the inception phase of an IT project and update thereafter as required throughout the project's life cycle. The NBC believes that Executive Business Decision Software (EBDS) is the only software that will provide the required functionality.  As a proof of concept, the NBC plans to enter into a pilot project to assess the ability of EBDS to integrate information technology (IT) system components and associated costs.  The polot project will assess the transition costs of converting from the existing hardware environment.  The polot project will assess the ability of the software to rapidly: 1.  Integrate multiple sources of data including, but not limited to, hardware, environmental, software and staffing elements. 2.  Generate and display detail and summary level graphical and tabular analysis results. 3.  Generate and display detail and summary level cash flow time line charts. Respondents must be able to demonstrate that their methods and software tools will be able to meet the requirements through the pilot project. Concerns having the ability to furnish this type of software shall provide written notice including a telephone number for a Point of Contact (POC) to the Acquisition Office listed above within the time frame specified.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement. All sources responding to this synopsis shall submit information relating to their business status, including identification as to whether small, large, minority-owned, women-owned, or 8(a) certified.  NAICS code is 541512. A firm is considered small for this acquisition if its size standard does not exceed $21.0 million. Based on information available at this time and the proprietary nature of the software, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the items specified to be available from Executive Business Decisions.

The Government has contracted with McCormick Selph Corp. for MMODS  since 1999. The M57 MMODS was procured under a commercial contract and therefore the Air Force did not purchase rights in proprietary design.  The sole source determination is made in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(iii) stating award to any other source than the incumbent would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government will furnish the MMODS as Government Furnished Equipment. This acquisition will require the contractor to perform the following tasks:  1. Perform testing for the re-certification/life extension of the explosive ordnance components for the Modular Mechanical Ordnance Destruct System (MMODS). These components consist of the Pull Activated Devices (PAD), Linear Shaped Charge (LSC), Flexible Detonating Cord (FDC), and Electro Explosive Devices (EED) for Safe and Arm components. 2. In addition to functional testing, pre-test environments for accelerated aging and simulated shock and vibration will be performed.  Since this hardware comprises a flight termination system, pre-test environmental as well as functional test requirements shall meet range safety standards. The contract period of performance is expected to be five years. Any persons or companies interested in this notice are to respond the requirement (s) and submit their capability statement to the Contracting Officer within 15 days of this notice. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541710 with a size standard of 1000 employees. The capability statement should address why the company believes that the sole source justification is no longer valid. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential Offerors.

<DESC>A. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Space Vehicles Directorate (VS), Joint Warfighting Space Office at Kirtland AFB NM is interested in receiving proposals from all offerors to design and build a high quality imaging spectrometer system. The total program budget for the design and build effort is approximately $10 to $15M over 30 months. There will be a separately priced contract option for a complete data package on the design, manufacturing, support, and operation of the sensor payload.  

B. The objective of the Advanced Responsive Tactically Effective Military Imaging Spectrometer (ARTEMIS) project is to develop a hyperspectral sensor suitable for integration on a government provided spacecraft bus and interface to government furnished data storage and processing system as part of a rapid development experiment.  The objective of this effort is to achieve a sensor payload.  The sensor design includes an imaging spectrometer capable of covering the visible through short-wave infrared spectral range, and a high resolution panchromatic imager.  The total hyperspectral sensor cost includes the telescope; optics; the spectrometer including the Focal Plane Array; the control and read out electronics; pre-delivery characterization; documentation; integration support at a government facility and support during early in-flight calibration verification.    The completed design must include a plan for delivery of the flight hardware sensor subsystem with complete calibration within 15 months after contract award.  The proposal should include a contract option that may be exercised at any time during the contract period of performance, to provide a complete data package on the design, manufacturing, support, and operation of the sensor payload and/or spacecraft that will allow the government to procure additional sensors in a competitive selection process.  The data package includes but is not limited to: mechanical drawings, optical layout/drawings, electrical specifications and data flow specifications, electrical/mechanical/thermal interface drawings and specifications, test/verification procedures, common/unique support equipment, long lead/critical spares lists, software documentation, interface requirements for payload and/or spacecraft, and storage/handling procedures.

<DESC>Air Education and Training Command Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB, TX, seeks potential sources for a government acquisition for an Airpower Operational Effect Research Tool (AOERT).  The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511.  This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up requests.  

AOERT will be an unclassified/for official use only (FOUO) interactive geospatial multimedia database for research and analysis of the role of airpower in recent major combat operations.   The database will include information on Operations Desert Storm (17 January-28 February 1991); Allied Force (24 March-10 June 1999); Enduring Freedom (7 October 2001- ); and Iraqi Freedom (20 March-1 May 2003).  This database will pull together the best information, data, maps, and imagery to afford planners, analysts, students, and historians the ability to educate themselves about contemporary airpower and to research strategy, technology, and effects at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels.  The AOERT will provide access to data and existing documents, and will provide chronological, statistical, and geographic modules to afford in-depth analysis of the four conflicts.  The software application will allow the user to research and analyze individual conflicts as well as to compare conflicts.  The user will be able to create, capture, export or print analytic results, graphics, and data.  The database will reside on a computer platform at Maxwell Air Force Base, on the local area network (LAN) at Maxwell AFB, and in a DVD format suitable for distribution to students and researchers.

The following tasks are required:  

1.  Material Collection and Digitization - Collect materials and convert them into electronic format suitable for inclusion in database.  Expertise in evaluating source material for inclusion in the database, accurate knowledge of the effects of weapons, the type of weapons and platforms employed in air campaigns, and an understanding of the process, skills, and techniques employed to plan, implement, and evaluate air campaigns is essential to developing this product.  Finally, access to multimedia resources and collections that show air delivered effects in action or after the fact is also required to fully design and develop this product.  The required material will include materials germane to the following six major modules:  

1. Chronology:  A comprehensive chronology for each conflict, including military and political events that can be electronically linked to imagery, documents, and geographic data.

2. Data:  Statistical data for each conflict, including sortie and strike data records and target databases that can be electronically linked to the chronology and to geographic data.  Also, the data will include information, media, and verification of collateral damage claims related to the employment of air delivered munitions in the combat zones of conflicts contained within the database.

3.  Geography: Geographical data, including:

3.1.1.  An overall country mapping capability for Afghanistan, Iraq, and Yugoslavia, including vector basemap geographical data to joint operations graphic (JOG) fidelity (1:100,000).

3.1.2.  In-depth modules for two to five major cities from each conflicts (e.g., Baghdad, Belgrade, Kabul), including satellite imagery of the entire city at 1 meter resolution and additional mapping products (JOGs, city graphics, vector data layers for both military and non-military features) allowing exploration via GIS.

3.1.3.  Select “chips” of imagery and GIS data for discrete targets and special interest areas.

4.  Imagery: A searchable library of still imagery and weapons systems video (WSV), linked to the geographic data and target databases.  The imagery library will include the option for a database of all available video, linked to storage on a non-DVD central server.

1.5.  Reference:  Aircraft and weapons fact sheets, organizational information, biographies, country data, etc.

1.6.  Documents:  A library of public domain and hard-to-get documents such as reports, studies, briefings, transcripts, etc., to include:

1.6.1.  Press releases, press conference transcripts, speeches, etc.
1.6.2.  Oral histories	
1.6.3.  Air University and other service war college publications
1.6.4.  Official military history reports
1.6.5.  Lessons learned documents, including the Gulf War Air Power Survey (GWAPS) and other unclassified reports
1.6.6.  Select after-action reports and briefings
1.6.7  Comprehensive materials related to collateral damage (photographs, video, statistical information, and verification of claims)

2.  Database Design

2.1.  Design, develop, and program Graphic User Interface (GUI)

2.1.1.	The six modules will afford in-depth analysis of the four conflicts.  The software application will allow the user to research and analyze individual conflicts as well as to compare conflicts.  The user will be able to create, capture, export or print analytic results, graphics and data.

2.1.2.	The GUI will provide a common workspace running in a central window with a constant Left Pane providing a set of menu options.  The GUI should resemble and act in the same manner as the Air Force’s primary mission planning software, Falconview.

2.1.3.	The user will have the option to explore existing data and resources, and create new data, with the ability to export data as a screen capture, in Microsoft Excel spreadsheet form, or as a RTF or HTML document.

2.1.4.	AEORT will use ultra-compressed file formats to save space and will the incorporate a wide variety multi-media components (including imagery, maps, video, etc.) linked through a rigorous, quantitative database.  

2.1.5.	The database structure will move from the top level of generality that captures the broad parameters of the conflicts down through the level of individual event (mission) or target records.  

2.1.6.	Modules will be linked via hyperlink.

2.1.7.	The developer will program information regarding pertinent targets, a geographic interface to access the targeting information, other interface tools, and associated imagery (both pre-strike and post-strike as available) of the targets.  To create this database, the developer must have access to primary source material, knowledge of weaponeering, the ability to program with the software suites specified, and familiarity with digital cartographic materials.

2.1.8.	AOERT will be designed to run from a single DVD on any computer running Microsoft Windows.  

2.2.  Create and populate database with source material including maps, JOGS, photographs, video, and text


3.  Installation, Integration, and Testing

3.1.  Install the database on a hard drive attached to a stand alone computer, on the Maxwell LAN, and on a DVD.

3.2.  Demonstrate the ability to copy the database onto other DVDs for replication to students

Expected Deliverables:

<SUBJECT>65 -- In Vivo Electrochemical Immunoassay
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories, the lead research and development laboratory for the Department of Energy’s physical security needs, is seeking one or more business partners in the medical diagnostics field, including but not limited to glucose detection, to engage in the creation of a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) for the further development of Sandia’s ElectroNeedles technology for in vivo electrochemical immunoassays.  Commercial licensing of the technology described in this posting will also be considered.  Commercial licensees will have the opportunity to obtain, up to and including, an exclusive license to the intellectual properties in pre-negotiated, defined fields of use for reasonable compensation.  It is expected that the business partner (or partners) that works with Sandia to develop the ElectroNeedle technology will promptly incorporate it into a commercial analyte detection product.  

Sandia believes this technology may best be commercialized by medical diagnostics companies with experience in diagnostic systems and with successful product offerings.  Potential partners must provide Sandia information describing their ability to research, design, develop, manufacture, distribute, market, and service fully functional diagnostics systems.  

The subject technology is a platform of individually addressable microelectrodes, capable of painlessly passing into a patient’s skin and accessing interstitial fluid.  Various analytes are detected in vivo via electrochemical methods, allowing analytes possessing redox behaviors to be easily detected in real-time without pain to the patient.  To date, Sandia has demonstrated glucose detection with this technology.   

To express interest in this opportunity, please respond by mail or fax to Teresa Montoya by 06 July 2005 at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0115, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque New Mexico 87185-0115, Fax (505) 844-8011, E-mail: tmontoy@sandia.gov.  Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice.

Option Year I:  Oct 1, 2005 through Sep. 30, 2006

Option Year III:  Oct 1, 2007 through September 30, 2008

The contract awardee will perform horse farrier services according to the below Statement of Work for Naco Border Patrol Station.

The designated Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) at Naco Border Patrol Station is Sandi Goldhamer.

STATEMENT OF WORK: FARRIER SERVICES FOR THE NCO STATION


The Mounted Horse Patrol Unit of the Naco Station currently has twenty (20) horses assigned to it.  As such, caring for the horses, maintaining the facilities and having agents available for farrier services has become very expensive and taxing on the unit’s ability to maintain the maximum number of agents in the field to perform their official duties. 

The station does not currently have a designated or contracted farrier to provide shoeing for the horses.  Employing a contractor would eliminate the need for the unit supervisor to seek out a farrier every five to eight weeks to shoe the station’s horses.  A contract farrier would be held accountable for a guaranteed work product whereas a non-contract farrier limits his work to a very limited guaranty and would most likely charge a mileage fee to refit a shoe.  A disadvantage noted in soliciting a different farrier every shoeing cycle is that the farrier does not have the opportunity to “learn” each horse and become familiar with its shoeing needs.  This lends itself to many an animal becoming lame, thus being placed out of service until it heals.  Some injuries due to lameness can permanently disable an animal, costing the agency in veterinary services and ultimately having to replace the animal.

The advantages to having a contract farrier is that he/she would become familiar with each of the animals and have an understanding of each of their shoeing needs.  A contract farrier would be required to comply with standards established by the agency or risk losing the contract award.

A contractor would be responsible for providing all labor, supervision, equipment, supplies, training, and transportation in order to provide services at a specified site. 

The following are minimum requirements for farrier services:

Farrier:

·	Shoe horses every four to eight weeks by certified farrier. (Farrier should possess a certificate from a recognized Farrier Training Facility)

·	If a shoe is lost – replacement will be in a timely manner (within 24 hours)

·	The farrier shall perform his/her work, 7-days per week, between the hours of 7:00am – 5:00pm.

·	Shall correct any discrepancies noted, as directed by the COTR or HPU SBPA, within a three day period after receipt of services at no additional cost to the Government.

·	Shall maintain an approved Hoof Management and Maintenance Schedule (Final approval on any maintenance schedule shall be approved by the unit supervisor.)

·	Shall have a minimum of three years experience at a journeyman level and be in compliance with all applicable state and local regulations.

Note:
(1)	Vendor is responsible for any costs or damages suffered to the Government (i.e. veterinary costs, etc) that is a result of negligence within a three-day period after Farrier service. The COTR, Contracting Officer and HPU SBPA will determine negligence.

(2)	Shoeing locations may be changed, added or deleted throughout the contract period.

Mail 2 copies of Invoice:

<DESC>Ammendment to incorporate the: Notice for Filing Agency Protest.
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair 
and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was 
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and 
time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is 
empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General 
Accounting Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast 
Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest 
with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their 
concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or 
Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast 
Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to 
the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the 
concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for 
Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend 
contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time 
requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a 
timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the 
Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and 
solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency 
protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the 
contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are 
unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may 
file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, 
the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be 
suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in 
writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best 
interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 
calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at 
FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of 
the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing 
of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within 
the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program 
should be forwarded to the address below:

HSAR 3052.209–70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE 
                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 

 (a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002. 
    (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

A) REMOVE: FAR clause 52.225-1 Buy American Act â€“ Supplies (June 2003)
B) REMOVE: Requirement for contractor to provide particular sole codes.

Such orders may be issued from date of award through the last day of the contract. (b) All delivery orders or task orders are subject to the terms and conditions of this contract. In the event of conflict between a delivery order or task order and this contract, the contract shall control. (c) If mailed, a delivery order or task order is considered â€œissuedâ€ when the Government deposits the order in the mail. Orders may be issued orally, by facsimile, or by electronic commerce methods only if authorized in the Schedule. 52.216-19 -- Order Limitations (Oct 1995) (a) Minimum order. When the Government requires supplies or services covered by this contract in an amount of less than $100, the Government is not obligated to purchase, nor is the Contractor obligated to furnish, those supplies or services under the contract. (b) Maximum order. The Contractor is not obligated to honor --(1) Any order for a single item in excess of $30,000; (2) Any order for a combination of items in excess of $30,000; or (3) A series of orders from the same ordering office within 10 days that together call for quantities exceeding the limitation in subparagraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section. (c) If this is a requirements contract (i.e., includes the Requirements clause at subsection 52.216-21 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)), the Government is not required to order a part of any one requirement from the Contractor if that requirement exceeds the maximum-order limitations in paragraph (b) of this section. (d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Contractor shall honor any order exceeding the maximum order limitations in paragraph (b), unless that order (or orders) is returned to the ordering office within 10 days after issuance, with written notice stating the Contractorâ€™s intent not to ship the item (or items) called for and the reasons. Upon receiving this notice, the Government may acquire the supplies or services from another source. 52.216-21 â€“ Requirements (Oct 1995) (a) This is a requirements contract for the supplies or services specified and effective for the period stated, in the Schedule. The quantities of supplies or services specified in the Schedule are estimates only and are not purchased by this contract. Except as this contract may otherwise provide, if the Governmentâ€™s requirements do not result in orders in the quantities described as â€œestimatedâ€™â€™ or â€œmaximumâ€ in the Schedule, that fact shall not constitute the basis for an equitable price adjustment. (b) Delivery or performance shall be made only as authorized by orders issued in accordance with the Ordering clause. Subject to any limitations in the Order Limitations clause or elsewhere in this contract, the Contractor shall furnish to the Government all supplies or services specified in the Schedule and called for by orders issued in accordance with the Ordering clause. The Government may issue orders requiring delivery to multiple destinations or performance at multiple locations. (c) Except as this contract otherwise provides, the Government shall order from the Contractor all the supplies or services specified in the Schedule that are required to be purchased by the Government activity or activities specified in the Schedule. (d) The Government is not required to purchase from the Contractor requirements in excess of any limit on total orders under this contract. (e) If the Government urgently requires delivery of any quantity of an item before the earliest date that delivery may be specified under this contract, and if the Contractor will not accept an order providing for the accelerated delivery, the Government may acquire the urgently required goods or services from another source.(f) Any order issued during the effective period of this contract and not completed within that period shall be completed by the Contractor within the time specified in the order. The contract shall govern the Contractorâ€™s and Governmentâ€™s rights and obligations with respect to that order to the same extent as if the order were completed during the contractâ€™s effective period; provided, that the Contractor shall not be required to make any deliveries under this contract after contract expiration date. 52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract.

The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within the period specified in the Schedule. 52.217-9 -- Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000) (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days; provided, that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 5years.
INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE: FAR clause 52.247-34 F.o.b. Destination (November 1991)
RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS: 1) Does the Buy American Act Clause apply to this requirement? Answer: NO. FAR clause 52.225-1 Buy American Act â€“ Supplies (June 2003) has been removed from the requirement. FAR Clause 52.225-5 Trade Agreements (Jan. 2005) does apply to this requirement. 2) In whose catalog may I find the sole codes as described in the bid? Answer: Disregard sole codes. All shoes must meet OSHA requirements and ANSI Z41 standards www.astm.org. 3) Except in the case of the "professional" shoes, are the colors important? Answer: The color is not important but the contractor must offer two colors for each shoe. 4) The 3E size request is also difficult because most manufacturers have moved to two widths:  M and W. Will a "W" be acceptable if the boot has an oblique (i.e., extra wide) or other type of extra roomy toecap that fits like a 3E? Answer: The requirement states that shoes sizes must be available up to size 13 with a triple E width. If the manufacturerâ€™s shoe widths are different from what is in the requirement, the contractor must explain the difference in widths in their submitted quotes. The contractor must assure that the proposed widths will fit up to a triple E in width.
