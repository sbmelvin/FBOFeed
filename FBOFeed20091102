<DESC><p>INTRODUCTION: The Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) is a wing at the Space &amp; Missile Systems Center, Los Angeles Air Force Base. SBIRS missions are missile warning, missile defense, battlespace characterization and technical intelligence. This RFI concerns Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) work that is required by the Wing. The SE&amp;I work will be spread across the SBIRS Wing programs which include DSP On-Orbit Support and Sustainment (DOSSC), SBIRS Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) and SBIRS Follow-On Production (SFP). The prime contractors for the Wings programs are Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. <br />INDUSTRY DAY: The Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Program Office will hold an Industry Day on 29 May 2009 for parties interested in participating in the solicitation for a System Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) contract; both small and large business participation is highly encouraged. For this acquisition, the anticipated NAICS code is 541712. The Industry Day will be held at the Space &amp; Missile Systems Center, Los Angeles Air Force Base, Gordon Conference Center, Bldg 270, 483 N. Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245. In the morning, the wing will brief the program requirements, including the draft acquisition strategy, system and segment requirements, and the SE&amp;I contractor's required interactions within the program. In the afternoon, we will make ourselves available for brief one-on-one discussions with potential interested prime contractors in order to listen to your suggestions. One-on-one sessions will be made by appointment and last no more than 30 minutes. The intent of the sessions is for the Government to listen to suggestions regarding the RFP or qualifying criteria for the source selection. Any information provided by the Government will be only information that is equally available to all interested parties. <br />The purpose of this event is to exchange preliminary information with industry and to solicit feedback and suggestions regarding the Government's forthcoming acquisition documents for the SBIRS SE&amp;I effort. The contemplated schedule includes a first draft RFP is in June 2009, a final RFP in August 2009, source selection in September, and contract award in November. <br />Please send the names of no more than 5 representatives from any prospective prime contractor to colleen.trickey@losangeles.af.mil in an email that contains no other questions or information and is labeled "Industry Day attendees - Your company name." Please include the name, SSAN, DOB, POB, Citizenship of each attendee. All meetings will be held at the unclassified level. You will get a confirmation of the time the meetings begin on May 29 after that. <br />PROGRAM INFORMATION: SBIRS has an incumbent Advisory and Assistance (A&amp;AS) contractor that assists with a diverse range of activities that includes both A&amp;AS and system integration work. The incumbent's contract ends in December 2009. This RFI inquiry pertains to the follow-on to this effort which will primarily be for SE&amp;I work. A cost reimbursable contract is contemplated. Work under the follow-on contract will commence in January 2010 and continue for approximately 5 years.</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI is for market research purposes only. Respondents should note that the government will not return any information submitted in response to this notice. The Government is not responsible for any costs incurred by respondent's regarding any responses to this RFI.</p>
<p>CONTRACT OBJECTIVES: SE&amp;I and A&amp;AS tasks are shared by the Government Program Office, FFRDCs, the SE&amp;I Contractor, and the Segment Contractors. SE&amp;I tasks includes leading the coordination, guidance and execution of end-to-end systems engineering and integration activities at the systems level across all inter-Segment and external interfaces for requirements development, system testing, interface verification, system deployment, operations, and sustainment. It also includes oversight and insight of systems engineering and integration within system Segments as required to ensure system performance is met. It is expected that the SE&amp;I contractor must be capable of working intimately with all programs in the wing, and have expertise in the ground and space segments of those programs. However, the SE&amp;I contractor must also have the capability to act independently and objectively for the benefit of maintaining SBIRS programs on target with cost, schedule and performance objectives. There are three work locations that will need to be staffed- Sunnyvale, CA, Boulder, CO, and El Segundo, CA. The Program estimates that between 70 and 120 people are needed to provide services in all three locations. The Program also estimates that approx 50 percent of contractor staff will require a TS/SCI security clearance.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: To help develop an appropriate acquisition strategy and a clear and effective RFP for the SE&amp;I Follow-on contract, the SBIRS Program Office is soliciting industry inputs on the following topics: <br />1) System engineering/integration acquisition initiatives or creative, inventive solutions to reduce risk presented by the SBIRS missions; <br />2) Lessons learned and best practices; <br />3) suggestions for the eventual proposal documents, including the Statement of Objectives, contract type and incentive/award fee plan, contract deliverables, and Work Breakdown Structure, and Statement of Work instructions, and<br />4) Organizational Conflict of Interest issues, <br />5) Sections L and M suggestions. <br />Contractors must document and submit all input in writing, including recommended discussion questions by 0800 PDT 22 May 2009. Discussion questions will be addressed on Industry Day. All input shall be submitted to SMC/ISSW/PK (SBIRS), 483 N. Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245-2808, and Attn: Elizabeth Chirdon, Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>Explosion DynamicsContract Number DE-AP27-09RV15065Modification A003SynopsisThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of River Protection (ORP) planstocontract by means other than full and open competition.  DOE ORP plans toawarda sole source modification to Explosion Dynamics Consulting contract numberDE-AP27-09RV15065.  Explosion Dynamics Consulting will provide expertconsulting services for ORPs Nuclear Safety Division to evaluate theconservatism in Hydrogen in Piping and Ancillary Vessel (HPAV) designcriteriain the Waste Treatment Plant.DOE ORP requires consulting services for the Nuclear Safety Division. Thecontractor will provide documented risk perspectives for various WTP issuesincluding but not limited to, (1) addressing the potential re-evaluation oftheconservatism in Hydrogen in Piping and Ancillary Vessel (HPAV) designcriteria.    Because of concerns about the conservatism of the currentaccidentanalysis that provides the technical basis for the WTP design, additionalperspective is needed concerning the potential impacts of minimizing theconservatisms to a more reasonably bounding criteria. One Senior NuclearSafetyAnalyst will be provided to support this peer review.This modification for consulting and evaluation of the conservatism inHydrogenin Piping and Ancillary Vessel (HPAV) design criteria in the WasteTreatmentPlant is estimated at $30,000.  It is estimated that the total contractpricewill be increased from $22,500 to $52,500. The Contracting Officerconsidersthe estimated cost to be fair and reasonable.The statutory authority permitting this action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1),whichdetermines that only one responsible source exists and no other supplier orservices will satisfy agency requirements.This notice is not a request for proposals, and none will be accepted;however,DOE ORP will review any information submitted by interested parties todetermine if they could potentially fill similar requirements in thefuture.Any questions or comments regarding this action should be e-mailed to RobynBurt, Contract Specialist, DOE Office of River Protection, Richland, WA99354,at robyn_l_burt@rl.gov.

<DESC>This solicitation N10PS30009 was formerly numbered Solicitation 8010-01.  Solicitation 8010-01 is no longer a valid number for this DOI procurement.  Closing date of N10PS30009 is December 1, 2009.
Solicitation N10PS30009 seeks on call (OC) flight services consisting of small (not more than 7,000 pounds approved gross weight), turbine engine, minimum of three-passenger seat helicopters to support Department of the Interior, (DOI) bureaus and cutomers in their transport needs within the Conterminous 48 States.  Contractor services include provisions of small helicopters, pilot(s), fuel, aircraft maintenance support, and all other associated equipment, as prescribed in the government's solicitation.  Mission activities are for interagency fire management program and other related resource support and may include, but are not limited to, fire suppression, fire monitoring, initial attack, prescribed fire, aerial ignition, rehabilitation seeding, offshore vessel landings and extended over water flights and nd other administrative activities.   The Government reserves the right to negotiate pricing with those offering helitorch pricing and availability of seeding buckets in the event individual projects of 30 days or less are needed and are planned in advance by DOI bureaus and customers.  If you are interested in supporting fire management program aircraft activities for DOI bureaus and customers you should submit an offer in response to this solicitation.  DOI ARAs do not provide fire management support to DOI bureaus and customers. 
Contractor(s) must possess a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certificates issued under 14 CFR Part 135, 133 and 137.   Aircraft offered must also be carried on the Contractor's list required by 14 CFR Part 135.63 or Operations Specifications Part D, "Aircraft Listing," as appropriate.  
The contract period will be from the May 1, 2010 through April 30, 2011 for the first year with options to renew for two additional years.   This is the only DOI on call small helicopter solicitation that is planned for issuance for the next three years.   If you operate types of aircraft that meet the minimum aircraft requirements and are interested in supporting the DOI under DOI procurement systems, you will need to submit a proposal as provided herein and subsequently be awarded a contract from the solicitation. Multiple awards are expected to be made.  If an individual aviation vendor holds a DOI ARA and the same services can be provided via the on-call helicopter contract, the ARA may be cancelled.  We plan on eliminating duplicate procurements when possible.  
It is a requirement that any successful awardee must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award being made.  It is the offeror's responsibility to ensure registration is accurate and valid.  
Solicitation information will be available through the fedbizopps site (found under Department of the Interior, Office of the Secretary, NBC, Aviation Management Headquarters, Boise, ID) and at http://amd.nbc.gov.  This solicitation is set aside for small business concerns.  AFTER READING THE SOLICITATION, questions may be directed to Toni Musgrove, 208-433-5022, Toni_Musgrove@nbc.gov.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a modification to Contract N00019-09-C-0007 for a Life-of-Type parts buy of the obsolete Spansion ROM (Flash) Memory, Part Number AM29F010B-55EI and Spansion Fine Pitch Ball Grid Array, Part Number S29AL016D90BAI, which is to be integrated into the Tomahawk Block IV missile in order to sustain uninterupted, on-going unit production.  This Life-of-Type procurement will avoid expensive component redesign and requalification, and considers attrition, usage, and projected rebaselining.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Since 1994, RMS has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for the Tomahawk Weapons System (TWS).  RMS, as prime development contractor for the Tomhawk Block IV, funded approximately $175M of shared missile development effort.  With this cost share arrangement, RMS retained the technical data package for the Block IV missile and the unique skills required to integrate the Life-of-Type buy components into the missile.  Raytheon is the sole designer, developer and producer of the Tomahawk Block IV, and the only known source that possesses the engineering data, technical skills, and requisite knowledge of the design, fabrication, interfaces, performance, operation, maintenance and support characteristics of the Tomahawk Block IV missile.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tomahawk Block IV missile is required to conduct tasking under this contract, RMS is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Lockheed Martin, Simulation, Training & Support (LM STS) to manufacture six (6) Color Display Monitors P/N 2057AS311-02 and associated cable assemblies P/N 2056AS727-02 and P/N 2055AS547-01 for use with the Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS).  The CASS Color Display is a ruggedized, custom designed, shipboard qualified flat panel monitor used with CASS test stations.  The CASS Color Display presents both text and graphics from a Compaq (DEC) Alpha Server using the existing video and electrical interfaces and mounting hardware.  The brightness and contrast controls shall be placed on the front of the color display along with two emergency shutoff buttons.  One button is used to remove power from the Unit Under Test (UUT) and the other removes power from the test station.  The Government intends to procure the above items under the authority of Title 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Government does not own all the technical data necessary to conduct a competitive procurement for the exact CASS Display, and requalification and testing of a newly designed display would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government.  A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on the responses received to this synopsis is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This is not a request for competitive proposals; however all responses to this notice must be received within 15 days.

<DESC>The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for Survey Statistics Support. This requirement will support the EPA in its survey statistics analyses for research and regulation development to comply with various Executive Orders and to support the Agency?s initiatives.
The successful contractor will be required to provide survey statistics support to the Office of Water and any other EPA offices that require technical support within the scope of the PWS.  
This contract is primarily focused on obtaining survey statistics support for data collection planning and analysis. (Survey statistics are often applied to data from a statistically drawn sample to make inferences about a larger population.) To a lesser extent, the contract also supports survey instrument development (e.g., questionnaires) and web surveys.
Examples of potential survey statistical support under this contract may include the following:
Statistical sample designs for a survey of the steam electric industry;  Population estimates from a survey of coalbed methane extraction projects; Comparison of survey results from different studies related to biosolids at publicly owned treatment works; and Confidence intervals for national estimates based upon data from a survey of Superfund sites.
The RFP PR-CI-09-10584 will be solicited under full and open competition with the NAICS code designation for the acquisition being 541620.  It is anticipated that a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee/Level-of-Effort contract will result from the award of this solicitation. The base period is expected to begin on June 1, 2010. The base period and each available option period will consist of 1,500 direct labor hours with each period having the potential of an additional 4,500 direct labor hours. It is anticipated that the contract will have one (1) base period with four (4) option periods consisting of 12-months each for a total maximum potential performance period of five (5) years and a total of 30,000 direct labor hours. 
The following sources will be excluded from consideration for award: 
Firms that could potentially discharge wastewater from point sources (e.g., industrial facilities, service industries), and discharge deicing and/or anti-icing fluids, associated wastewater, and/or associated stormwater into a sanitary sewer system (?indirect dischargers?), stormwater or combined sewer system, or directly into a water of the US (?direct dischargers?); Firms that could potentially provide treatment of wastewater and/or stormwater or treatment of deicing and/or anti-icing fluids, associated wastewater, and/or
associated stormwater; Firms that manufacture or sell water treatment equipment and/or water treatment chemicals or this type of equipment and chemicals for removing deicing and anti-icing fluids from wastewater/stormwater.  This category would also include firms that manufacture and sell deicing and/or anti-icing fluids, not just the treatment chemical to remove them from wastewater/stormwater; Firms that provide consulting and/or technical services to wastewater and stormwater dischargers relating to waste minimization, water quality, and water quality for deicing/anti-icing operations; and Firms that act in consulting, advisory, or legal capacities with, or for, firms trying to overturn or circumvent regulations on wastewater, stormwater discharge, water quality and water quality for deicing/anti-icing operations.
In addition to the exclusion from consideration for award, the successful awardee will be subject to the limitation of future contracting, which will prohibit future contracting by the awardee with entitities providing these same types of excluded services.
All offerors will be required to disclose any business or financial relationships with firms excluded above and also the following firms, which may be directly or indirectly impacted by the work under the resulting contract: 
Firms engaged in Airport Deicing, Coalbed methane extraction, Construction and development issues, Steam electric generation, firms that specialize in Cooling water intake structures, Drinking water treatment, Health Services, and firms that are Publicly Owned Treatment Works.
The solicitation is expected to be issued approximately December 1, 2009 on EPA?s website: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  This office does not intend to mail hard copies of the solicitation.  It is the responsibility of the offerors to frequently check the EPA website for updates or changes.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

<RESPDATE>111709
<CONTACT>Chris M. Ganey, CONTRACTING OFFICER, Phone 301-443-4379, Email CHRISTOPHER.GANEY@PSC.HHS.GOV
<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER THE HHS PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER TASK ORDER CONTRACTS.


Purpose of the Task Order:  
The Head Start program is administered by the Office of Head Start (OHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  The Head Start program served over 908,000 children in FY2007. More than 62,000 of those children were served in 650 Early Head Start programs. 
The Early Head Start (EHS) program was started in 1995, thirty years after the first Head Start preschool programs were funded, to serve pregnant women, infants, and toddlers through the provision of early, continuous, intensive and comprehensive child development and family support services.  As a part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5) (ARRA), OHS received dollars for the sole purpose of serving additional pregnant women, infants and toddlers in its Early Head Start program. The purpose of this contract is to develop criteria, recruit, train,  and maintain a database of approximately 120 Infant and Toddler consultants who will serve as Start-Up Planners to many of the 600 newly awarded Early Head Start programs. Start-up planners are an allowable use of Head Start funds. A start-up planner is a consultant, hired by the program, to help facilitate the programs start-up team through the process of planning and preparing for the implementation of Early Head Start services.  The current ARRA-funded expansion of Early Head Start grantees, the first since 2002, will nearly double the number of EHS programs serving pregnant women, infants and toddlers. This task order will purchase services to train a new cadre of consultants to support the effective and rapid start up of most of the new programs.

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICEVendor Transformation Forum Challenges and Ideas Acquisition ProcessIAW FAR 15.202, the Government hereby issues this pre-solicitation notice in order to establish strategic partnerships with industry to conquer the challenges faced by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as it transforms into a high-performing organization that is better aligned with 21st century Veterans and our responsibilities to deliver our Veterans the best possible support and services.  Specifically, the VA is seeking ideas and solutions to help address the following 13 Greatest Challenges which have been identified by the Department:1.	  Eliminate Veteran Homelessness2.	Enable 21st Century Benefits Delivery and Services (e.g. backlog reduction)3.	Automate GI Bill Benefits4.	Implement Virtual Lifetime Electronic Records (VLER)5.	Improve Veterans Mental Health6.	Build Veterans Relationship Management (VRM) Capability to Enable Convenient, Seamless Interactions7.	Design a Veteran-Centric Healthcare Model and Right-Sized Infrastructure to Help Veterans Navigate the Healthcare Delivery System and Receive Coordinated Care8.	Expand Healthcare Access for Veterans, Including Women and Rural Populations9.	Ensure Preparedness to Meet Emergent National Needs (e.g. hurricanes, H1N1 virus)10.	Develop Capabilities and Enabling Systems to Drive Performance and Outcomes 11.	Establish Strong VA Management Infrastructure and Integrated Operating Model12.	Transform Human Capital Management13.	Perform Research and Development to Enhance the Long-Term Health and Well-Being of VeteransEach challenge is described in greater detail on the following web site:  http://www.va.gov/oamm/transformation/challenges.cfm	Industry is requested to submit their ideas as a "concept paper" which shall be a short, three to five page document describing the proposed solution.  The concept papers must present solutions to systemic challenges, not technologies or approaches that address a narrow problem.   The concept papers along with a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate to support the proposed solution shall be submitted electronically under the "Submit Your Ideas" selection at the web site:  http://www.va.gov/oamm/transformation/.Representatives from the VA and the Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) Massachusetts Institute of Technology Research (MITRE) Corporation, will conduct initial evaluations to determine which ideas/concepts have viability for further consideration.  Contractors who submit concept papers that warrant further consideration will be notified by e-mail and requested to provide additional technical information including briefing slides.  The contractor may also be invited to conduct an oral presentation of the solution to VA personnel.  The proposed solution will be further evaluated for viability by VA Subject Matter Experts (SME's).  Finally, the Government may enter into a third phase whereby they issue a Request for Proposal to conduct a best value source selection with those vendors whose ideas/concepts have merit.    Concept papers that are not recommended for further consideration will be archived and the contractor will be notified in writing that they are unlikely to be a viable competitor on any subsequent acquisition.   Concept paper evaluations will be conducted in accordance with the criteria identified on the web site at:  http://www.va.gov/oamm/transformation/process.cfm.  Bid and proposal costs will not be reimbursed by the Government.  In addition to the challenges identified herein, industry is also encouraged to submit ideas for the improvement of VA processes not specifically identified above.  These proposals shall be submitted electronically under the "Submit Your Ideas" selection at the web site:  http://www.va.gov/oamm/transformation/ on a continuous basis and will be reviewed and evaluated in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 15.6, Unsolicited Proposals.

<SUBJECT>Assessment, Analytical, Logistics and Other Assistance for Global HIV/AIDS Office
<SOLNBR>10-HAB-001
<RESPDATE>111609
<CONTACT>Dottie L Watson, Phone 301-443-2752, Fax 301-443-5462, Email dwatson@hrsa.gov
<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide supplemental expert assistance and support to the Health Resources & Services Administrations  (HRSA) HIV/AIDS Bureaus (HAB) Global HIV/AIDS Office (HRSA/HAB/Global Program). 

The most significant purpose of this proposed contract is to identify qualified consultants to assist with site and partner assessments in developing countries being funded under the Presidents Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR).  International travel and associated arrangements for consultants would also be an activity within the scope of this contract.  A second purpose is to identify qualified consultants to periodically assist with planning activities, periodically provide training and other development support to HRSA/HAB/Global Program staff, perform program evaluation, and occasionally review documents and provide feedback to HRSA/HAB/Global Program team.  This support would provide strategic direction to the Program overall as well as help staff learn individually and collectively to improve work processes, increase grantee/employee satisfaction, promote effective knowledge transfer and provide enhanced technical/programmatic support to HRSA/HAB/HRSA/HAB/Global Program grantees. A third purpose is to provide logistical support for a number of possible meetings some of which may occur in Africa or elsewhere internationally.    

The Global HIV/AIDS Program manages HIV care and treatment programs in Africa and the Caribbean. Over the next several years each country program is to be transitioned to the government or to local partners.  This transfer of US Government funding and responsibility to new partners requires assessments and other activities to assure that new partners have the capacity to appropriately manage these funds and appropriately care for patients.  HRSA creates teams which include staff from HRSA and CDC as well as consultants to assess new partners and the sites they propose to manage.  HRSA already has a set of consultants but needs a larger group of qualified consultants to provide sufficient availability for approximately eight assessments per year.  In addition, this contract involves making any travel arrangements for the consultants including obtaining visas, travel insurance, and immunizations as well as processing payments for all consultant activities.  

Consultants are also needed to assist the Global HIV/AIDS Program with a number of activities which may include staff development, strategic planning, program evaluation, training and document review.  The contract also requires travel and other arrangements for these consultants as well as processing of payments to consultants.  

The Global HIV/AIDS Program may host one or more meetings annually.  It is possible that such a meeting could be held in a developing country though no international meetings are anticipated at this time. More likely is a meeting to be held in the US, possibly in the Washington DC Metropolitan Area, involving grantees or other partners.  Any such meetings would require collaboration with the Global HIV/AIDS Program on event planning and logistics, and to help facilitate the event.  Such an event would likely involve approximately 125 participants.       

Contractors will be required to:   

1. Meet initially with the Project Officer and other(s) designated individuals; 
2. Prepare minutes from initial meeting; 
3. Create and refine work plan;
4. Provide monthly progress reports;
5. Provide monthly detailed financial reports;
6. Develop criteria and a recruitment plan and subsequently develop a roster of experts;
7. Provide summaries of all meetings with project officer; 
8. Provide draft policy and evaluation documents(s);
9. Provide recommendations/implementation plans; and 
10. Submit final plan or report.

Qualified contractors (in team or alone) must satisfy the following minimum requirements.  Provide a detailed description of your companys experience and demonstrated abilities to deliver each and every one (address each separately) of the following requirements:  
1. Identify consultants with appropriate experience to meet the various consulting needs of the program.
2. Make travel and other arrangements for travel to international locations.
3.Consistently, accurately and on a timely basis process payments to consultants for time worked and for expense reimbursement.
4.Manage all logistics associated with a meeting to be held in the U and involving approximately 125 participants.
5.Consistently meet reporting requirements.

In addition, contractor (in team or alone) must possess:    

1. Prior experience in contracts of the type;
2. History of adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance;
3. Sufficient information management and computer resources for contract implementation;
4. Reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and
5. Ability to address operational issues that impact survey performance. 

In addition, it is preferable that the Contractor has experience working with federal contracts meeting deadlines while maintaining flexibility in the work process.  

A cost reimbursement type contract is anticipated, for a base year and four option years.  This is a new requirement.   The NAICS Code is 541611, with a small business size standard of $7.0 m.

Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice.  However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents capacity and capability to perform specific work as required.  Responses must directly demonstrate companys capability, experience, and/or ability to marshal resources to effectively and efficiently perform each of the tasks described above at a sufficient level of detail to allow definitive numerical evaluation; and evidence that the contractor can satisfy the minimum requirements listed above while in compliance with FAR 52.219-14 (Limitations on Subcontracting).  Failure to definitively address each of these factors will result in a finding that respondent lacks capability to perform the work.

Responses to this notice shall not exceed 30 single-spaced pages, excluding attachments, and must include:
1. Company name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and FAX numbers, website address (if available), and the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives.
2. Name, title, telephone number, and e-mail addresses of individuals who can verify the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses.
3. Business size for NAICS 541611 (size standard $7m or number of employees) and status, if qualified as an 8 (a) firm (must be certified by SBA), Small Disadvantaged Business (must be certified by SBA), Woman-Owned Small Business, HUBZone firm (must be certified by SBA), and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (must be listed in the VetBiz Vendor Information Pages).
4. DUNS number, CAGE Code, Tax Identification Number, and company structure (Corporation, LLC, partnership, joint venture, etc.).  Companies also must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR, at www.ccr.gov) to be considered as potential sources.
5. Identification of the firm's GSA Schedule contract(s) by Schedule number and contract number and SINs that are applicable to this potential requirement are also requested.
6. If the company has a Government approved accounting system, please identify the agency that approved the system.

Please submit copies of any documentation such as letters or certificates to indicate the firms status (see item #3, above).

Teaming arrangements are acceptable, and the information required above on the company responding to this announcement, should also be provided for each entity expected to be teammates of the respondent for performance of this work.

To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information.  Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly protected from disclosure.

This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in this announcement. This request is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this announcement.

Responses to this notice must be received by the Contracting Officer not later than 3:00 pm eastern standard time on November 16, 2009 for consideration.  Please forward responses via e-mail to dwatson@hrsa.gov and forward by delivery, surface mail or fax to the following address:  5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, Fax 301-443-5295.

Responses to this announcement will not be returned, nor will there be any ensuing discussions or debriefings of any responses.  However, information obtained as a result of this announcement may be reflected in the subsequent solicitation, and HRSA may contact one or more respondents for clarifications and to enhance the Governments understanding.

The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland, Program Management Office (PMA-207) desires a solution to replace the propeller control system with a more reliable and maintainable system or components that will provide lower operating and support cost.  

The performance Work Statement (PWS) defines the work necessary for design and installation of an Electronic Propeller Control System (EPCS) for the United States Navy C-130T aircraft. The 54H60 propellers currently utilized on legacy C/KC-130s was developed in the late 1950s.  Each propeller has a control system contained in a mechanical valve housing assembly.  The mechanical valve housing implements propeller control functions such as speed governing and blade angle schedule, which provide desired thrust control.  The control logic is executed with cams, levers and linkages.  Its reliability and maintainability is limited by its complex design.  The 54H60 propeller system on the current legacy C/KC-130T aircraft is the highest system degrader of the weapon system, and the control system is the single greatest driver.  In addition each aircraft has one analog electronic Synchrophaser, which controls the rotational position of each propeller relative to another.  

This requirement, including installation in up to 30 aircraft, needs to be completed not later than March 2013. The period of performance includes a twelve (12) month base period with four option years. The Request for Proposal (RFP) number is: N00019-10-P7-ZD034.

Identified by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 336413, the Government intends to award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee Contract for these services.  

Contractors who believe they possess the demonstrated expertise and experience in functionality shall submit electronically a statement of their capabilities to: Naval Air Systems Command Point of Contacts (stephen.whittaker@navy.mil) and (teri.berrian@navy.mil ) no later than 16 November 2009.  With the Capability Statement, interested firms shall indicate whether or not they are a large business, small business, small disadvantage business, woman owned business, or other type and include their contact information.  Interested parties are encouraged to provide benefits and disadvantages of each methodology.

This sources sought is for informational and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bid or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. When submitting email, please include the following information:  company name, address, point of contact, email address, phone number and fax number.

Title-Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) System
Purpose
The Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC)- Keyport Division is hereby conducting a market survey of potential sources for an Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) System. The procured system will consist of all equipment, controls, safety features, software, manuals, and training required to operate the AOI equipment and shall meet or exceed the functional requirements as outlined henceforth. The equipment shall be used primarily for supporting the fleet by providing process control and quality production of printed circuit boards (PCB) on new and reverse engineered boards.
Description
PCB's with advanced surface mount packages are becoming more common as well as more complicated with smaller components and higher densities of components. There are several steps in the PCB assembly process. Any inconsistency that occurs during this process may result in a defective product, causing increased costs in both time and money. One way to ensure process control is to manually inspect the product for common defects, but visual inspection may vary between operators and even time of day. Operators can only concentrate well for limited amounts of time and often overlook errors. An AOI system ensures each and every component is checked and highlights only the small number of potential defects, allowing the operator to focus on a few components accurately in a short amount of time. By simplifying the inspection, there is an increase in process control and yields, and a reduction in cost and time for rework. Inspections should be done after each major step in the assembly process to ensure the process is done properly.Functional Requirements

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT Paul McCarty, (706) 787-2094, paul.mccarty1@us.army.mil or Mike Tierney, (706) 787-2093, Michael.tierney1@us.army.mil.  65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR>     The Southeast Region (Reg. 3 & 4), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in the countries of Honduras and Cuba, and the territory of Puerto Rico announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Monitoring Catheters.  The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to, Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Community Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS) and the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the Prime Vendor Program.  The RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is February 2010.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Southeast region, the government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. Points of Contact: Paul McCarty, (706) 787-2094, paul.mccarty1@us.army.mil or Mike Tierney, (706) 787-2093, Michael.tierney1@us.army.mil.  <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.<BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Monitoring Catheters, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $150,235.95.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.  At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to Paul McCarty, (706) 787-2094, paul.mccarty1@us.army.mil or Mike Tierney, (706) 787-2093, Michael.tierney1@us.army.mil.   Submissions must be received by COB 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process. <BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified in Phase I or Phase II will be notified in writing (via email) at the conclusion of the evaluation process which is DSCP approval and the signing of the agreement by the final authority.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions / quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to Paul McCarty, paul.mccarty1@us.army.mil or Mike Tierney, Michael.tierney1@us.army.mil. by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified / invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  <BR>In general, acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and /or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE:  Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:    <BR>  <BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Monitoring Catheter products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.

Vendor MUST provide prime vendor conversion number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the Southeast Region PV (Owens & Minor) will be disqualified in Phase I.)  <BR>6.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Note vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.<BR>7.	Vendors MUST provide Monitoring Catheters that are Latex free/ Latex safe. Vendors who do not provide Latex Free/ Latex Safe products will be disqualified in Phase I.    <BR><BR>Phase II Plan  Clinical/Performance Evaluations and Pricing Analysis Process:<BR>Clinical/Performance Evaluations<BR>Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent directly to the TRBO point of contact and will be allowed fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the TRBO location by COB, 5:00 PM EST, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  Note: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and final delivery date of the product sample sets.<BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable.<BR>All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for seven (7) calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP final approval).   Vendor will provide no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation.  Vendors will ONLY provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  (Unused samples will not be returned).  Vendors WILL NOT be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.  Vendors WILL NOT be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products OR THEIR COMPETITORS PRODUCTS. To determine acceptability, the CPT, comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines from the Southeast Region will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting. <BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR><BR>1.	(NPSG.07.04.01) Implement best practices or evidence-based guidelines to prevent central lineassociated bloodstream infections. The Monitoring Catheter kit opens smoothly by peeling the cover back so the contents remain sterile.<BR>a.	It is important that the Monitoring Catheter kit maintains the sterile condition of the package contents. <BR>b.	The evaluator will examine the package contents, when opening, to assess for disruption of the sterile contents.<BR>2.	(NPSG.07.04.01) Implement best practices or evidence-based guidelines to prevent central lineassociated bloodstream infections. When advancing the Monitoring Catheter over the guide wire it glides smoothly without shearing the catheter. <BR>a.	A Monitoring Catheter that smoothly glides over the guide wire will not shear off and enter the bloodstream.<BR>b.	The evaluator will observe the Monitoring Catheter, while advancing it over the guide wire, to assess for smooth gliding action.<BR>3.	(NPSG.07.04.01) Implement best practices or evidence-based guidelines to prevent central lineassociated bloodstream infections. After connecting the Monitoring Catheter to the tubing, the Monitoring Catheter remains securely attached.<BR>a.	Monitoring Catheter tubing connectors must remain securely attached to the tubing to avoid patient blood loss.<BR>b.	The evaluator will attach any/ all connections and assess that the connectors in the kit remain tight when tugged.<BR>Pricing Analysis Process.  Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are found technical acceptable will be qualified/ invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Southeast Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by COB 5:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). <BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.	  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) period from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in descending order of importance:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Southeast Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This is the most important pricing element.  (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  (3) Potential Cost Avoidance and (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 24 NOVEMBER 2009 5:00 PM EST.<BR><BR>

This is a preliminary notice that on or about 30 November 2009 the Marine Corps Systems Command will release a Request for Information (RFI) via a Sources Sought Synopsis related to the Marine Corps Amphibious Assault Vehicle Systems (AAVS) upgrades.  This is not a pre-solicitation notice but advance notice of market research the Government is conducting.  The Government is not developing an RFP at this time and therefore none will be available.
Marine Corps System Command intends to solicit information from responsible sources for the purpose of performing Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV) Survivability, C4I, Environmental (SCE) and Improved Up-gun Weapons Station (I-UGWS) upgrades.  The purpose of the forthcoming RFI is to conduct market research that will identify potential sources, capabilities and interest in the program, and assist in developing the potential acquisition strategy to meet the Government's requirements.  The scope of work that is the focus of the RFI is for system integration services and SCE/I-UGWS upgrades for the AAV program.  The Government will provide further information via the RFI.  This notice is for market research purposes only and the Government will NOT provide any type of compensation for responses to the RFI.

This is a notice of intent to go Sol Source in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 for the following position:
Regional Environmental Compliance Coordinator for up to 120 days.
Vendor:
Dan Forney256-B Sylvia WayBowling Green, KY 42104-0390
Mr. Forney was the Region 1 and Region 8 Regional Environmental Compliance Coordinator (RECC) for 9 years and retired March 2009.  For anyone else to learn these duties would involve a steep learning curve and they would have limited productivity for several months.  We need a journeyman experienced with the requirements of the USFWS and familiar with current issues.  The demands of and for environmental compliance services are extensive and cannot be handled as a collateral duty.  Mr Forney knows the issues and the process and will fill this void admirably for the limited period of time.

<DESC>The Spring Mountains National Recreation Area has three upcoming construction projects.  At this time, there are no solicitations, plans or specifications available.  We expect each of these projects to have their own solicitations in the upcoming next couple of months.  Because it is expected that the solicitations will be coming out during the winter, the weather will make it impossible to conduct site visits during the time period for the solicitations, wo we are having a combined site visit of the three areas now before the snow sets in.  The "Show-me trips" are for 

Cathedral Rock Picnic Area Reconstruction, Desert View Overlook Reconstruction, and Lee Meadows Rehab projects planned for advertising in 2010.

Please meet the contracting officer and his representative at Lower Cathedral Rock Trailhead parking area on November 9, 2009.

We will look at the sites, and take questions from the attendees, which will be helpful in preparing the requests for proposals, as well as helping us identify potential contractors.

Brief description of projects: 

Cathedral Rock Picnic Area:  Project is located on Nevada highway 157 at milepost 0.1.  Work includes but is not limited to demolition of existing trailhead parking area; reconstruction of picnic area roads, buildings, picnic sites and paths, water and waste water systems; and installing electrical lines for buildings and host sites.

Desert View Overlook:  Project is located on highway 158 at milepost 7.3.  Work includes but is not limited to reconstruction of existing parking area, overlook and access trail; construction of new overlook and access trail; and roadside slope work.

Lee Meadows Rehab:  Project is located on highway 156 at milepost 1.1.  Work includes but is not limited to construction of trail bridges crossing the channel near the Lee Meadows parking area and construction of erosion control structures within the drainages entering Lee Meadows.  

We would appreciate if interested companies RSVP during the week to give us an idea of attendance.  You may send an e-mail regarding your interest to Steve Roehr at sroehr@fs.fed.us.

If there are any technical questions regarding the likely work to be performed, please e-mail to Alvin Yoshida at ayoshida@fs.fed.us.

Thank you for your interest in contracting with the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area.

This is NOT a pre-solicitation notice, and there is no promise of a solicitation implied.  It is our hope and intent only.  Set-aside and sourcing decisions have not yet been made.  All interested companies are invited to view these sites.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IF PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER: W91278-09-C-0020, R & D Maintenance Service, Inc., 409 N Main St., Hennessey, OK   73742-1017.  Using Recovery Act funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-09-C-0020, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway, Alabama and Mississippi, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815, Hennessey, Oklahoma. North American Industry Classification Systems Code (NAICS) 561210 applies to this contract award.  The contractor will:  perform Electrical Upgrades in Pickensville Campground, Blue Bluff Campground and Piney Grove Campground.  Contract clauses required for project involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated in the existing contract.  This existing contract must be used because:  1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources required can not be fully determined prior to removal of existing transformers, breakers and panels.  2) This contract enables work to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on the visiting public and the economy.   The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using Recovery Act funds, including compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation , and, to the maximum extent practicable, making fixed-price (FP) contract awards using competitive procedures.  However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although Mobile District's contract was not awarded as a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside, and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  The existing Operation and Maintenance contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk.  In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing Operation and Maintenance contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles for the work anticipated under this modification.

<SUBJECT>Synopsis - M67854-10-R-1011:Squad Integration Capabilities
<SOLNBR>M6785410R1011
<CONTACT>
<DESC>Pursuant to contract M67854-08-C-1118, previously awarded by the Government, it is the intention of the United States Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Infantry Weapons Systems to continue these services by extending the period of performance on the previously awarded contract.  Due to recent programmatic changes attempting to relocate the Squad Integration Capability to a government facility, a facility capable of housing the equipment and structures is necessary until the move to the government facility.  It is currently built-in and operated at a Stafford Va location with the incumbant contractor Raytheon Network Centric Systems, 2501 West Universtiy Drive. McKinney, Texas 75070.  The government intends to sole source to Raytheon due to the significant duplication of costs associated with moving the equipment and structures out of the current location to another facility temporarily and then moving it again to the government facility located in MCB Quantico.

APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES:  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation: (1) FAR 52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (FEB 1998).  This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.  Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available.  The offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the offeror and submitted with its offer.  In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its offer.

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses in their latest editions apply to this solicitation:   52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (Jun 2008).  The following terms and conditions are added as an addendum to this clause:

Note 1:  The Government will evaluate proposals and may award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  
(End of addendum)

BASIS FOR AWARD:  In accordance with FAR 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999):  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.   The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers in descending order of importance:

1)  FACTOR 1:  Technical Capability - The offeror shall submit the following information for technical evaluation:

a) Describe your technical approach for satisfying the requirements of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) for Seminars A and B, including any topics that you intend to address in each seminar that are in addition to those required by the PWS. 

b) Describe how you will recruit and hire qualified seminar instructors.  Resumes shall be submitted for project manager, alternate project manager, seminar instructors and any proposed alternates.

2)  FACTOR 2:  Relevant Past Performance - past performance information shall include at least three references to support the proposal to include contract number, type, value, description, contracting officer and technical points of contact, email address, telephone and fax numbers.  Past performance will be evaluated for relevance and extent of previous contracts, quality and conformance of supplies/services to contract requirements, timely delivery/performance, customer satisfaction, and cost control.  Past performance information (PPI) utilized in the evaluation will be obtained from contractor references, as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  Contractor references that cannot be contacted will not be considered.  Greater weight (both positive and/or negative) will be given for performance under previous contracts that are more similar in scope, size and complexity to this procurement.  Those offerors with no relevant past performance information will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably, however, an offer with no relevant past performance history may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.

3) Price:  The offerors proposed price will be evaluated but not rated.

Technical and past performance, when combined, are more important than price.  As technical scores converge, the price grows more important in making the award selection.  The Government may award to other than the lowest priced offeror.  

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

U.S. COAST GUARD

Washington, DC 20593-7112

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should submitted to:

Department of Homeland Security
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602

<DESC>MODIFICATION 03 provides answers to questions received as listed below.  The due date for receipt of proposals is unchanged.

SOLICITATIONO. 09-223-SOL-00191 FOR ANIMAL HUSBANDRY SERVICES

QUESTIONS (Q) & ANSWERS (A)

Q1) Section C, Page 62 item 5 states the technical proposal must contain a discussion of present or proposed facilities and equipment which will be used in the performance of this contract.. and;  Section C, page 64, number (4) states ..describe the facilities and equipment available for the conduct of the proposed research.   If helpful, submit a floor plan to show relationship of rooms to each other and to those used in other but similar programs.  Is there a requirement for an additional facility beyond those identified in the solicitation (MOD 1, White Oaks, Bldg 29B and Nicholson Lane)?

A1) Task Order 1 and Task Order 3  During option year 2013 of the contract, it is anticipated that CBER will relocate to the White Oak Facility.  In that event, a modification to the contract would be required to accommodate the change. The animal numbers should remain the same and the overall husbandry required should remain close but additional staff may be required.   TO2: Animal research involving poultry may occur at the MOD-2/CVM site but no additional costs are anticipated. 

Q2) Section C, Page 64 number (5) states Describe previous or current related grants or contracts from which the investigators proposed for this project have drawn or are now drawing support.  Does the government require a staffing plan that includes an Investigator? 

A2)  The Government does not require a staffing plan that includes and Investigator.

Q3) Would the government consider extending the proposal due date?

A3) The due date for receipt of proposals remains November 4th.

Q4) Would the government please provide current contractor staffing numbers and positions for each of the work sites?  

A4) The solicitation was issued as a Performance Work Statement.  Prospective contractors should propose a staffing plan to include the positions and numbers for each of the task orders. 

Q5) Part B of the main solicitation document, page 3, under the section B.2 Compensation Fixed Price Schedule, states that the government shall pay the Contractor the fixed price of negotiated task orders under  this contract based on the fixed rates specified below. Part B continues, under B.4 Schedule of Charges (Unit Prices) to provide a chart that includes the CLIN, Labor Category, Unit (HR) and columns for hourly rates by labor category for the base and option years. These sections suggest that the contractor, under the Business Proposal response, only provide in his response only fixed price hourly rates for each labor category proposed.  Additionally, Section B B-2 Compensation Fixed Price Schedule, item C., for Attachments 1-3, also suggests that the only pricing to be provided for the Task Orders will be fixed hourly rates.   However, under L-1 General Proposal Instructions, B. Business Proposal Instructions, page 58 of the main solicitation document, it is suggested that all direct costs, including ODC, be included with the cost proposal. Please advise on what should be included in the cost proposal as it pertains to specific cost elements to be included with the pricing for each task order, and whether a separate summary chart, outlining just the fixed hourly bill rates for each proposed labor category, for the base and option years,  also be included in our business proposal response.  

A5) A fixed priced for each task order should be proposed. However, the breakout of cost elements is requested to see what is included on top of the actual hourly rates to comprise the loaded hourly rates. 

Q6) Please advise if both the SF 1449 and any associated signed amendments (SF30) to the solicitation can be placed in the Business Proposal.  

A6) The SF 1449 and SF 30 have not been used with this solicitation.

QUESTIONS SPECIFIC TO TASK ORDER 1

Q7) Who supplies the animals?  

A7) FDA acquires animals from several approved vendors.

Q8) How do the metabolism cages work?  

A8) The metabolism cages are cages specific for technical procedures such that animals are placed into them for a period specified by the protocol/PI in order to collect urine and/or feces.  The TO SOW clearly indicates in the percentage of studies requiring metabolism cages plus as noted in that section, a second metabolism chiller will be received at a later date.  

Q9) What type of studies are being done?   

A9) Studies include but are not limited to: Toxicology, tissue donation, organ injury, nanoparticle distribution with rats, mice and rabbits.

Q10) What type of ophthalmologist are used in studies?   

A10) It is not required that the Contractor provide Ophthalmologists, and therefore not a contract requirement.

Q11) Where are the control drugs kept?  

A11) Principal Investigators have their own research license for controlled substance and are not kept onsite. There is a controlled substance wall locker available to house euthanasia agents. 

Q12) How are the transporters washed? 

A12) In the cage/rack washer.

Q13) Who is responsible for pest control in the lab?  

A13) Pest control is a service acquired under a separate contract.

A14) The Animal Program Manager order supplies, but only as requested and submitted by AHU. AHU is responsible for tracking the inventory as indicated in the SOW. 

Q15) Where are the surgical instruments kept?  

A15) The Principal Investigators provide whatever surgical instruments they use. 

Q16) How often is training done in common use rooms?  

A16) As often as the schedule allows, training animals are available and training is needed. Hands-on training is also provided to the Principal Investigators as requested. 

Q17) Where are the busiest times of the year in the lab?  

A17) It varies and cannot be predetermined.

Q18) What positions are on the current contract?  

A18) There are three positions on the current contract:  Contract Manager, Technician/Support Services Supervisor, and Animal Caretaker. 

Q19) What types of certifications are required?  

A19) The required certifications are indicated in the base SOW.

Q20) In attachment one, White Oak task 1 on page 6 the numbering skips from 2.11 to 2.13. Please advise if any sections were omitted in the solicitation.   

A20) Number 2.12 was skipped and the "automatic" numbering did not renumber, therefore no sections were omitted.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC><p>RFI/TARGETED MARKET RESEARCH AND<br />ANSWERS TO INDUSTRY QUESTIONS
<p><br />The ISSW SE&amp;I source selection team is seeking to maximize communication and request input from industry throughout the entire process before final RFP release. Our approach is to incrementally solicit your input on our draft solicitation documents in advance of a complete draft/final package. We have chosen to accomplish this in two ways: 1) to release the draft documents with a set of questions on which we are requesting your input, and 2) to respond on a regular basis to specific contractor questions that have been generalized for the entire community. We look forward to your candid input to ensure that we are delivering the clearest solicitation package to meet the ISSW Enterprise's requirements. This week we are publishing our draft Performance Work Statement and seek your comments and feedback on it. We also have the following questions:<br /><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FROM ISSW/TARGETED MARKET RESEARCH</p>
<p>1) Is the PWS an adequate description of the ISSW enterprise's SE&amp;I requirements? If not, what else do you need?</p>
<p>2) What questions would you like our Space, Ground, or EN groups to answer at the next Industry Day?</p>
<p>3) Would you prefer to bid to organizational structure or to bid a "proposed structure?"</p>
<p>4) We plan to have an objective incentive plan. What do you think the milestones/objectives for payment should be?</p>
<p>5) Our intention is to require a demonstration or fulfillment of some requirement as a key discriminator in the source selection. What do you think that the wing should select to request for a demonstration?</p>
<p>6) If you intend to bid as a prime contractor on this effort, we are requesting OCI mitigation plans be sent to us as soon as possible, ideally by July 24, but not later than July 31.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QUESTIONS FROM INDUSTRY AND ANSWERS FROM ISSW - What follows are answers to questions we have received from industry.</p>
<p>Q: What kind of processes will be changed? Stated otherwise, are there NEW processes that need to be created? If so, what?</p>
<p>A. The SBIRS Wing does not have a current SE&amp;I capability and relies on non optimized processes. Therefore the SE&amp;I contractor will have to document and manage SE&amp;I classic processes e.g. DM and CM in order to meet or provide baseline architecture information and documents.</p>
<p><br />Q: What is the work structure breakdown for the new SE&amp;I contract? (i.e. who is doing which tasks?)</p>
<p>A. The PWS will define and contain these functions for the SE&amp;I contract. Broadly stated, the current prime System Contractors will maintain their product engineering role. The Aerospace Corporation will continue to provide specialized technical expertise and assessment along with mission assurance oversight. The <br />Government will retain decision authority for all Enterprise engineering actions.</p>
<p>Q: Who will chair the review boards under the SE&amp;I contract? Is it the Wing Commander or the SE&amp;I? What level of authority will the new SE&amp;I contractor have?</p>
<p>A. The Engineering Review Boards will be chaired by the EN functional staff with cross functional input from the Government segment leads based on SE&amp;I and Aerospace assessment of the Prime Contractors' proposed changes. As stated in the PWS, the new SE&amp;I contractor, will document, manage, and assess the current Enterprise Architecture and provide to the government appropriate input for future system planning.</p>
<p>Q. How is accountability going to be measured on the SE&amp;I contract?</p>
<p>A. The PWS will require the contractor to meet objectives of all deliverable documents; quality, schedule, customer relations, internal and external interface and communications and personnel staffing/retention and cost control.</p>
<p>Q. Can we have one-on-one sessions with Program Office and Center Leadership? <br /><br />A. . Unfortunately, no, the Leadership elements do not believe it would be fair to meet with some potential SE&amp;I contractors individually, but not all. While Program Office personnel routinely meet with contractors who do business with the Wing on program matters, we recognize that some of them may be potential offerors on the SE&amp;I solicitation. In all such cases, Program Office and Center Leadership will not discuss the SE&amp;I source selection or the desired SE&amp;I contractor capabilities. In addition, during our next Industry Day, there will be another opportunity for contractors to meet one on one with members of the government team.</p>
<p><br />Q. When will the contract be awarded? Is there a time limit?</p>
<p>A. The ISSW needs SE&amp;I capabilities that only a qualified contractor can provide as soon as possible. There is some overlap between the work currently provided by the SETA contractor on a labor hours basis and the work that will be done by the SE&amp;I contractor, so a transition period is anticipated. The current SETA contract expires on December 31, 2009.</p>
<p><br />_______________________________________________________________________________<br />Please email your responses within 2 weeks if possible to Elizabeth Chirdon in a word document. (elizabeth.chirdon@losangeles.af.mil)</p>
<p>Also feel free to email questions at any time before the source selection begins and the government will answer questions to the greatest degree possible on FedBizOps.</p>

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service, Gifford Pinchot National Forest, intends to acquire by contract the replacement of carpet at the Johnston Ridge Observatory.  The work consists of replacing approximately 1220 square yards of carpet with carpet tiles of the same color scheme as that which is currently in place.

The project site can be located by traveling on Interstate 5 to exit 49 at Castle Rock, WA, and then east on SR 504 approximately 54 miles to the project location at the Johnston Ridge Observatory.  The Johnston Ridge Observatory is frequently snowed out by November 10 and as such it is highly recommended that those contractors interested in visiting the project site prior to submitting a proposal do so before that date.  Through November 1, 2009 the visitor center will be open and no appointment is necessary.  After November 1, interested parties must contact Duane Chatham, Maintenance Program Manager, to arrange access to the project site.  Mr. Chatham can be reached at 360-274-2132.

The period for performance will be 30 days from issuance of a Notice to Proceed, which is anticipated to be issued on or about April 16, 2010.  The government will proceed to issue a solicitation utilizing FAR Part 13 procedures for Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This acquisition is 100 percent set-aside for certified HUBZone concerns.  Offerors will be evaluated on price, experience, past performance and other factors. A single contract will be awarded to the offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is the best value to the government.  

The estimated cost of construction for this project is between $25,000 and $100,000. Payment protection will be required for this project and Davis-Bacon wage rates will apply to any resulting contract.  The proposed contract-type is firm-fixed price.  This solicitation will be available on or about November 13, 2009.  

All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the government.  In accordance with FAR 4.1102(a), prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract.  Lack of registration in the CCR on the part of the offeror will render an offeror ineligible for award.  Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov//.

o	The two directions of traffic are separated by a physical barrier or traffic indicator which does not permit access from either direction within one block;
o	The location access is directly from a highway, unless there is a traffic control device within two blocks or equivalent from the proposed office space.
	To allow for visibility to the public, this governments office space shall be located not more than the equivalent of two city locks from a primary or secondary street serving the office.  The lessor shall provide acceptable signage from the primary or secondary street at no separate cost.  The route from the primary or secondary street shall be direct.

<a href="mailto:sandra.oconnell@us.army.mil">US Army Space and Missile Defense Command, Deputy Commander</a>
<DESC><BR>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) is providing notice that a Request for Proposal (RFP), W9113M-09-R-0008, for the Development of Medical Countermeasures (therapeutics) for the Treatment of Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses (HFV) will be issued on or about 20 November 2009 with an anticipated contract award on or about 30 May 2010.  This requirement is a total set aside for small businesses.  In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, all interested offerors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  CCR registration can be accomplished at the following website: http://www.ccr.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541711 with a size standard of 500 employees.  The Government does not intend to use FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.  In accordance with FAR 16.301-3, for an anticipated cost plus incentive type to be awarded, potential offerors must ensure that they have an adequate accounting system, as determined by their cognizant Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) office.  If you are a small business prime you would be required to comply with FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting and 13 CFR 125.6 (known as the 50% rule).  Under the 50% rule in the case of a contract for supplies (other than procurement from a non-manufacturer of such supplies), the concern shall perform work for at least 50% of the cost of manufacturing the supplies, not including the cost of materials.  The small business prime contractor must meet this requirement (1) individually, or (2) together with other small business members of a formal joint venture, or (3) together with a small number of small business subcontractors forming an informal joint venture, in which those subcontractors meet the definition of ostensible subcontractor as set forth in 13 CFR 121.103(h)(4).  Team members in such formal and informal joint ventures are exempt from affiliation rules under the conditions set forth in 13 CFR 121.103(h)(3).  Rules on affiliation and joint ventures are at FAR 19.101, 13 CFR 121.103, 13 CFR 124.513 and 13 CFR 125.6.  There is no limit to the number of other team subcontractors or size status of subcontractors.<BR><BR>The Transformational Medical Technical Initiative (TMTI) mission is to protect the Warfighter from bioengineered or newly emergent biological threats by providing a response capability from identification of pathogens through the delivery of medical countermeasures.  To support this effort, TMTI anticipates multiple awards for development of therapeutics for the treatment of HFV.  Only therapeutics that have reached the HFV Class entry criteria are eligible to be considered for these contracts.  Any drug or biologic that can be used as a treatment for HFV at a minimum may participate in the RFP, additionally, if the drug or biologic can be used as a prophylaxis in addition to treatment, it would be considered for this Solicitation.   Excluded from this solicitation are drugs or biologics intended solely for use prior to exposure  (i.e., prophylaxis).<BR><BR>The HFV Class threshold entry criterion is: <BR><BR>Compound has demonstrated and achieved Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 4 (as defined by the Integrated Medical TRLs https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=f6246b5fa678b0b327ab299902ed2015&tab=core&_cview=0) <BR><BR>Achievement of a TRL is predicated on successful completion of all activities listed for that TRL, as well as all previous TRLs.  For instance, achieving TRL 4 status indicates that a therapeutic has successfully demonstrated all activities as defined by the Integrated Medical TRL for TRL 1, 2, 3 and 4.  <BR><BR>The focus of these contracts is the advanced development and delivery of therapeutics that ideally are broad spectrum and flexible.  The base contract effort requires therapeutics meeting or exceeding the HFV Class threshold entry criterion.  Ultimately, the proposed therapeutic shall, assuming exercise of all options, undergo the New Drug Application/Biologic License Application (NDA/BLA) process and be delivered as a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved and licensed therapeutic.  TMTI intends to award up to six (6) HFV therapeutic development contracts.  The base award for each of these contracts is intended to be cost plus incentive fee.  <BR><BR>The base contract will include all activities required to proceed with development of a HFV therapeutic to complete Phase I Clinical Trials exclusive of those activities required to achieve TRL 4.  The specific activities to be conducted will depend on the FDA licensure status of the proposed HFV therapeutic.  Offerors proposing a HFV therapeutic meeting the HFV Class threshold entry criterion but that have not been granted FDA permission to continue into Phase I Clinical Trials will conduct activities to support the submission of their IND, any subsequent tests required by the FDA, and Phase I Clinical Trials.  Offerors proposing a HFV therapeutic meeting HFV Class threshold entry criterion that have been granted permission to continue into Phase I Clinical Trials will conduct activities associated with Phase I Clinical Trials.  <BR>The Government will consider the exercise of options if the MDA approves entry of the HFV Class into the EMD phase.  Except as otherwise provided in the RFP, options will be exercised for the awarded contracts based on the Governments decision to proceed with the contracted effort.  Contractors with products that fail in development or in default of contract requirements will not be continued by option exercise. All other performing contractors will not be denied the opportunity to continue performance under an option clause by the Governments decision to exercise (or not exercise) an option absent a best value comparative evaluation using established RFP evaluation criteria which shall include, but not be limited to, post-award performance, the Governments preference to avoid therapeutics addressing duplicative indications and the Anti-Viral Therapeutic Target Product Profile (TPP) Guidelines, dated February 24, 2009.  However, the Governments right to unilaterally decide not to exercise all options and to discontinue the development of all HFV therapeutics is paramount .TMTI intends to pursue schedule incentives for the base CPIF and each of the options exercised.<BR><BR>A TMTI regulatory compliance team may conduct a facility compliance review to verify the accuracy of the offerors affirmations.  The regulatory compliance team will provide advance notice of its visit to the offerors facilities.  The team shall provide its findings and recommendations to the HFV Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) technical team.  The offeror is solely responsible for furnishing the regulatory compliance team the necessary information to demonstrate meeting the qualifications.<BR><BR>Subcontractors may be used.  If an offerors approach includes subcontract performance, the offeror shall provide the same qualification information for the subcontractor(s).  The government regulatory compliance team may similarly conduct a site visit of the subcontractor(s).  <BR><BR>This acquisition is open to participation by foreign firms at both the prime contract and subcontract level, subject to FAR/DFARS Part 25 limitations.  <BR><BR>Proposals will be evaluated based on Factors, Subfactors, and Elements representing the Best Value to the Government.  Delivery schedules reflecting each phase of the end items development, to include the ultimate delivery of an FDA licensed product, will be proposed by the offerors and will be evaluated under the evaluation criteria associated with a Best Value evaluation.   TMTI anticipates delivery of an FDA licensed therapeutic product within 4 to 6 years from an offerors receipt of an FDA IND acceptance, but all proposed delivery schedules will be evaluated.  All interested parties can view, download, and print a copy of the solicitation and any resulting amendments when released on or about 20 November 2009, at the following website: http://www.tmti-cbdefense.org/ .  No paper copies of the RFP will be provided and no mailing list will be maintained because the acquisition will be posted on the above website.  Questions or correspondence should be directed by e-mail only to sandra.oconnell@us.army.mil and please reference the RFP number W9113M-09-R-0008.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  Only questions received within 14 days of issuance of the RFP will be entertained by the Government.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This notice is for the award of a firm fixed price change order under firm fixed price task order W52H09-08-D-5005/0045 which was awarded to Russell Construction Co. Inc. of Davenport, IA on October 15 2009. The change order is to remove the 6 existing rows of stringers (supporting steel members) and replace them with 4 rows, two centered under each rail in order to carry the required train loads.  During construction, the ballast material was removed on the railroad deck revealing the bridge stringers.  The stringers are so corroded and in such bad shape it was determined that they will not carry the required loads that are necessary to support a train.  The overall project is for the design of a deck, removal of the ballast and timber deck, inspection of the hidden portions of the floor beams, and construction of a new deck. This firm fixed price task order was awa  rded under Contract W52H09-08-D-5005 which was awarded under full and open competition using best value source selection procedures to Russell Construction Co. Inc. of Davenport, Iowa on August 21, 2008.  The design build and construction services  awarded under this contract include the type of work designated in this synopsis.

<AWARDEE>Pratt and Whitney Rocketdyne, Inc.,  6633 Canoga Avenue,  Post Office Box 7922,Canoga Park, CA  91309-7922
<DESC>&lt;P&gt;NASA/MSFC has applied funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of2009 in support of the Ares I Upper Stage Engine (USE) J-2X Project.  The total amount ofARRA funding applied to this contract is $48.9 million.  This is a modification to anexisting contract with Pratt and Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) of Canoga Park, California.  &lt;P&gt;ARRA funds supporting six technical tasks will be used to manufacture engine componentsand subcomponents for development engines: 10001, 10002, 10003, as well as Powerpack 2 tobe used for testing.  Five of the six technical tasks are related to manufacturing andassembly of development engine components, including the: Oxidizer Turbopump (OTP), FuelTurbopump (FTP), Main Injector and Ignition System, Main Combustion Chamber (MCC), andExhaust Nozzle.  The sixth technical task supports Gas Generator (GG) and Ignition SystemDevelopment Testing.  The contract modification for this effort covers a period ofperformance from October 2009 through September 2010.  &lt;P&gt;The Ares I USE contract was awarded on a sole-source basis.  Due to the scope of theeffort being performed using these ARRA funds, the existing ARES I USE contract is themost appropriate contractual vehicle for the effort required.  This contract modificationwas issued using the same cost-type contract arrangement that was established in the baseARES I USE contract award.  A cost-type arrangement is appropriate due to uncertaintiesinvolved in contract performance that do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficientaccuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract in support of this effort.  &lt;P&gt;

<DESC>RECOVERYTHIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.   THIS NOTICE IS NOT A NOTICE FOR SOLICITATION OF OFFERS.  THE ACTION DESCRIBED HEREIN IS A MODIFICATION TO AN EXISTING CONTRACT, DOLJ09RA00025.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR IDENTIFIED BELOW.

This opportunity was available only to MINACT, Inc. under contract number DOLJ09RA00025.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps has awarded a modification in the amount of $10,595 to the Gerald R. Ford Job Corps Centers, operated by MINACT, Inc.  These funds are provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  The funding is within the not-to-exceed ceiling for CTST on this contract.

It would have been impracticable to use a fixed price contract to secure services of the kind or quality required for this modification, since the modification was to an existing Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract (Cost Reimbursement Contract).

The funding is intended to address the following career technical skills training (CTST) project to support green training and practices applicable to all Job Corps Centers as detailed in Job Corps Information Notice No. 09-09:  Carpentry Exterior Rehab and Female Showerhead Conversion.  The operator of the Gerald R. Ford center will utilize these funds to support additional career technical skills training opportunities to the students of the Gerald R. Ford Job Corps Center.  The operator of the Gerald R. Ford Job Corps Center will not procure the services through subcontracting opportunities.

This modification has been awarded on October 30, 2009.

<DESC><br />Identification Number: Environmental Management's Nationwide Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Contracts, consisting of 22 contracts with the following numbers: DE-AM09-05SR22407, DE-AM09-05SR22403, DE-AM09-05SR22405, DE-AM09-05SR22406, DE-AM09-05SR22404, DE-AM09-05SR22402, DE-AM09-05SR22419, DE-AM09-05SR22401, DE-AM09-05SR22399, DE-AM09-05SR22400, DE-AM09-05SR22408, DE-AM09-05SR22411, DE-AM09-05SR22414, DE-AM09-05SR22413, DE-AM09-05SR22412, DE-AM09-05SR22410, DE-AM09-05SR22409, DE-AM09-05SR22420, DE-AM09-05SR22416, DE-AM09-05SR22422, DE-AM09-05SR22417, and DE-AM09-05SR22415.
<p>1. Agency and Contracting Activity: The United States Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Environmental Management (EM), Consolidated Business Center (CBC) proposes to modify EM's Nationwide IDIQ Multiple Award Contracts by extending the period of performance on the basis of other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved: The action being approved is a six month extension to EM's Nationwide IDIQ Multiple Award Contracts. On October 7, 2004, DOE awarded EM's Nationwide IDIQ contracts to 22 contractors (consisting of a mix of large, small, and 8(a) businesses) for either one or more of the following: Environmental Remediation (ER)/Waste Management (WM) Services; Deactivation, Demolition, and Removal (DD&amp;R) for Contaminated Facilities; and/or DD&amp;R of Buildings (Non-contaminated) across the DOE complex. The combined maximum order quantity for the contracts was $800M. The contracts have five year ordering periods that expire on October 7, 2009. The completion date for Task Orders placed during the effective period of the contracts will be for up to two years. The six month extension would extend the ordering period from October 7, 2009 to April 6, 2010, and combined maximum order quantity for all the contracts would remain at $800M.</p>
<p>The acquisition planning for the follow-on ID/IQ contracts began in May 2008 and continued through September 2009. The six month extension is for the purpose of ensuring that Nationwide IDIQ Multiple Award Contracts are in place, so that DOE has a means for continuing to accomplish needed ER, WM, and DD&amp;R work in the interim between the expiration of the current ID/IQ contracts and the follow-on ID/IQ contracts, in accordance with all the applicable laws, regulations, DOE Directives, permits, and Agreements and Orders. The six-month extensions will also support American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) objectives, as ARRA funded task orders are anticipated. <br /><br />3. Description of Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs, Including the Estimated Value: EM was created by Congressional mandate in 1989 and is responsible for cleanup and legacy waste management activities at DOE sites. The objective of the DOE EM program is to restore contaminated sites to a state protective of human health and the environment. To assist EM in meeting its objectives and support the needs of DOE, particularly when it is difficult to identify a specific quantity during a fixed period, EM awarded the subject IDIQ contracts to provide ordering flexibility, and promote small business utilization and competition. The purpose of this extension is to maintain the IDIQ contractual instruments while the award multiple contracts is made in two follow-on procurements so that DOE sites can continue to place timely, cost-effective, legally-sound task orders for ER, WM, and DD&amp;R services that are required nationwide to support EM's mission, as well as some non-EM sites. <br /><br />The maximum order quantity for the contracts combined for the entire 5-year, 6-month period of the extended contracts will remain at the original ceiling of $800M. No increase in the ceiling will be made. The maximum value of the work that may be ordered during the extension period is approximately $218M. (To date, seventeen task orders have been placed at a total value of $386M and three additional task orders with an approximate total value of $150M are in the process of award as well as $68M for a pending ARRA modification). Therefore, in order to ensure continuity of services for cleanup work across the EM complex, the current contract vehicle must be extended until the follow-on contracts are awarded.</p>
<p>4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: The Competition in Contracting Act, 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a), authorizes other than full and open competition when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The existing IDIQ contracts are currently being used for award of competitive task orders at a time that the contracts are nearing expiration, requiring extensions in order to permit the agency to complete these competitive acquisitions. Extension of these contracts will ensure continued availability of this critical contract vehicle and will avoid having potential offerors incur additional costs in preparing proposals for the relatively short period of time between the expiration of the current IDIQ contracts and the awards in the follow-on procurements.</p>
<p>5. Nature of the Action Requiring Extension: The extension of the Nationwide IDIQ Multiple Award Contracts is for the purpose of providing contracts to bridge the time period from when their original ordering period ends (October 7, 2009), until the follow-on Nationwide IDIQ contracts are awarded. Award of the follow-on contracts is anticipated to occur by April 2010. The acquisition planning process for the follow-on IDIQ acquisitions took longer than originally anticipated as a result of efforts to ensure competition was not unduly restricted. Extension for this six-month period will also ensure that competition is maximized under the follow-on acquisition. The existing IDIQ contracts also continue the availability of small business and 8(a) firms, and the use of competitive techniques between the existing awardees. <br /><br />6. Efforts to Solicit Offers from as many Potential Sources as Practicable: As the existing Nationwide IDIQ Multiple Award contractors are the only currently evaluated sources possessing the capabilities to perform the anticipated scopes of work for the bridge period, and award of task orders will continue to occur using competitive techniques among the awardees, no additional sources will be solicited for this extension. DOE published a synopsis stating the intent to issue a sole source modifications to extend the period of performance under the existing Nationwide IDIQ Multiple Award contracts. Although the synopsis is not a formal request for proposals or an invitation for bids, the synopsis did afford interested parties the opportunity to submit capability statements. After the 15-day response period, no capability statements submitted.</p>
<p>7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Anticipated Cost: This action will extend the Nationwide IDIQ contract on a no-cost basis; therefore, the current $800 million ceiling will remain unchanged, as will the rate and fee ceilings in the contracts. The $800 million ceiling and the rate and fee ceilings in the contracts were determined to be fair and reasonable at the time of award of the initial contracts. Additionally, a determination for fair and reasonable pricing will take place as competitive task orders are awarded.</p>
<p>8. Market Research: Formal market research has not been conducted to support this sole source extension request. Given the short time period for solicitation and evaluation of offers under a new procurement, the existing Nationwide IDIQ Multiple Award contracts are the only practical vehicles for accomplishing the work, as discussed in paragraph 5 above. A synopsis stating the intent to issue a sole source modification to extend the period of performance for the Nationwide IDIQ multiple Award contracts by six months was issued on July 27, 2009. The notice provided potential offerors a reasonable opportunity to submit capability statements to assist the Department in determining the existence of potential sources. At the end of the 15-day response period, no capability statements were received. <br />9. Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: EMCBC Office of Contracting is currently in the process of conducting two procurements for award of multiple IDIQ contracts similar to the current Nationwide IDIQ Multiple Award Contracts. DOE plans to competitively award multiple IDIQ contracts pursuant to FAR 15, FAR 19, DOE Acquisition Regulation (DEAR) 915, and DEAR 919. The services to be procured include Environmental Remediation Services, Deactivation, Decommissioning, Demolition, and Removal (DD&amp;R) Services of Facilities, Waste Management Services, and Regulatory Services at various locations throughout the United States in support of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) including National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). The EM Nationwide IDIQ follow-on acquisition will utilize two solicitations, one set-aside for small businesses and one unrestricted acquisition for work scope that encompasses complex and/or larger scopes of work. The estimated contract ceiling for the set-aside for small business solicitation is $926M; the estimated contract ceiling for the unrestricted solicitation is $907M. Any resulting contracts will be awarded with a five-year ordering period. The completion date for Task Orders placed during the effective period of the contracts will be for up to five years. Facilities classified as HazCat III, II, and I, including associated safety systems and/or associated or surrounding structures and land and associated utilities and distribution systems; reactor facilities, whether fueled or defueled; and complex facilities which have multiple hazards such as those containing a combination of radioactivity, elemental sodium, and/or mercury will not be included in the small business set-aside procurement. The procurements are at varying degrees of completeness; the small business set aside solicitation was issued to industry in August 2009 and the unrestricted solicitation is projected to be issued in September 2009. The projected award dates for the small business set aside and the unrestricted is March 2010 and May 2010 respectively. <br />EM began advance planning for these increasingly complex, follow-on procurements in May 2008 and it was not until June 2009 that EM received final approval of the Acquisition Plan. There were a series of unforeseen circumstances that delayed the follow-on procurements. They are listed as follows: <br />a) EM engaged the DOE complex in estimating usage of the IDIQ contracts from around the DOE complex. A complicating factor was the term of the proposed contracts and the significant amount of work that was being estimated for these two follow-on contracts. <br />b) Various strategies for improving task order competition and increasing utility of the multiple award contracts were thoroughly discussed and reviewed. DOE was also ensuring that any strategy developed included compliance with the requirement for the agency to maintain competition throughout the performance periods of multiple award IDIQ contracts.<br />c) In October 2008, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in Delex Systems, Inc., B-400403, October 8, 2008, determined the set-aside provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 19.502-2(b) apply to competitions for task and delivery orders issued under Multiple Award unrestricted IDIQ contracts. The GAO decision caused a delay in finalizing the Acquisition Plan because the Delex Systems case changed the way ordering will occur under multiple award contracts. <br />In sum, there were a series of delays due to the complexity of the two follow-on procurements and the unforeseen impact of the GAO Delex Systems case. However, the Department exercised due diligence in identifying appropriate follow-on strategies that provides maximum flexibility to the government in procuring its requirements in a relatively short time frame while increasing opportunities for small business participation. Additionally, through the steps taken in the acquisition planning phase, the agency has demonstrated the following: (1) that the use of multiple awards of indefinite-quantity contracts is a viable option for these follow-on procurements, (2) the agency has avoided situations in which awardees specialize exclusively in one or a few areas within the statement of work, thus creating the likelihood that orders in those areas will be awarded on a sole-source basis, and (3) the agency has maintained the ability to maintain competition among the awardees throughout the contracts' period of performance.</p>
<p>10. Listing of Interested Sources: In accordance with FAR 5.203(a), the EMCBC Office of Contracting transmitted a synopsis (attached hereto) of the proposed contract action to FedBizOpps.gov. The synopsis was posted on July 27, 2009 and described in detail the government's intent to extend the current IDIQ contracts by a period of six months. As required, the notice was published for 15 days. During this period, no capability statements received.</p>
<p>11. Actions to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition Before any Subsequent Acquisition for the Services Required: EMCBC Office of Contracting is currently in the process of conducting two acquisitions for the award of multiple IDIQ contracts, one set aside for small business and another using full and open competition, as described in paragraph 9 above. Awards are anticipated to be made in March 2010 and May 2010 respectively.</p>
