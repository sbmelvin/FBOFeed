<DESC>NA A sole source procurement is contemplated with AT&T Wireless, 4393 South Riverboat Road, Taylorsville, UT 84123 for non-personal service to provide airtime service for cellular phone service at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah (period of performance: From 1 Feb ruary 2003 to 30 September 2003).  Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. (C)(1), and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, supplies, services, and/or equipment required are available from one responsible source and no other type of supplies, services, and/or equipment w ill satisfy agency requirements.  Dugway Proving Ground purchased the cell tower equipment, installed the equipment on two cellular sites that gave the installation the most coverage, and entered into a lease agreement with AT&T for that equipment in excha nge for AT&T providing cell service at the installation.  Since this initial investment was made, there is no intent nor do resources exist to install other equipment that would allow another source to provide cell service.  Cellular service is particular to each manufacture/carrier; and one companys devices will not work on another carriers transmission equipment.  Therefore, to award cell service to any other carrier would require reinvestment in new cell towers, new phones, and duplicate the cost the g overnment has already spent to get existing cellular service on the installation.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES; however, all responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Supporting evidence must be fu rnished to demonstrate the ability to comply with the Government's requirements. If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with sole source negotiation with AT&T. The solicitation (DABJ19-03-T-0019) will be available on or around 22 January  2003 through the Armys Single Face to Industry at http://acquisition.army.mil and through the U.S. Army Contracting Agency  Dugway Proving Ground site at https://www.dugway.army.mil/10-3_ContractingDivision.htm.  Responses are due 27 January 2003, 1600 (MST).  In the event either site is not accessible, responses may be faxed at this number (435) 831-2103.  The point of contract concerning this sources sought action is Ms. Maxine Asay, Purchasing Agent at (435) 831-3362, or email asay@dpg.army.mil.

Amtec Corporation, as the integrated project engineering team for the development of a Munitions Recycling Capability (MRC) for the Anniston Munitions Center (ANMC) and for the AMCOM Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC), has developed a safe and environmentally friendly process for recycling of  obsolete tactical munitions. Amtec developed and integrated a Pilot-Scale missile disposal and recovery system and successfully demonstrated and validated the recycling of over 1,000 TOW and other Hazard Class 1.1 and 1.3 missiles. Amtec transitioned the AMRDEC pilot-scale technology to a full-scale, prototype production capability which allows for the disassembly of TOW missiles into their major subcomponents and the subsequent separation of all hardware components from the energetic propellant and warhea d materials. Amtec recently initiated low rate initial production (LRIP) of recycling of obsolete TOW missiles. Amtec will continue operation of the MRC which includes munitions disassembly, hardware and rocket motor denozzling, propellant removal, warhead  ingredient recovery, slurry explosive manufacturing, hardware decontamination, material handling, etc. Amtec will also provide system engineering support for new and emerging Resource Recovery and Recycling technologies, pollution prevention analysis and studies, disposition of recovered hardware and energetic materials for reuse and recycling, hazards/risk assessments, etc. A SECRET facility clearance is required. This is not a request for proposals/offers.

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. "F" - This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application.  The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Cherokee Technical Specialists LLC (CTS), Inc., 129 Bluebell Circle, Santa Rosa Beach, FL  32459, to perform the following requirement:

1.  Develop final machine shop drawings based upon a review of AFRL-generated conceptual drawings, review the manufacturing plan for producing a strengthened MK-84 Bomb Casing (SMACK-84) fabricated from ES-1b steel (a high-strength steel jointly developed by AFRL/MN and National Forge, Co.), develop plans and procedures for sub-component, i.e., lug inserts, etc., integration, and provide qualification test support for subsequent testing of the warhead case.   
 
2. Conduct a study to determine the most effective manufacturing process for fabricating the SMACK-84.  The study will compare the feasibility of using centrifugal cast tubes, extruded tubes, or seamless tubing and subsequent forging processes instead of making the warhead cases from solid billets of steel.

CTS is the only company capable of performing the tasks described above without substantial duplication of efforts and costs.  To perform this effort a company must have experience with ES-1b steel and knowledge of the steel's chemistry, the alloying process used to make the steel, and the manufacturing and heat treatment processes and procedures used for making warhead cases out of the steel.  Personnel with CTS were involved with the development of the ES-1b steel and have the required experience and knowledge making CTS uniquely qualified to perform this effort for the Air Force.

CTS is the only known contractor source of expertise available with the required knowledge and experience.  The output from this contract is critical in support of Thermobaric Weapon research.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with CTS sole source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  However, all responsible sources may submit a qualification package, which shall be considered by the agency.  Due date for responses (original and 1 copy) is 7 Feb 03, 3:00 p.m. CST.  No electronic responses will be accepted.  See Numbered Note 22.

<ARCHDATE>02012003
<CONTACT>David Tychman 301-227-5824
<DESC>The Carderock Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center intends to enter into a sole source procurement with PyroGenesis, Inc.  The Navy has been investigating plasma arc technology for the destruction of shipboard combustible solid waste for nearly a decade.  This effort included work in a 6.2 Exploratory Development Program on plasma torch and waste interaction, development of several conceptual designs by leading companies in the plasma field, and a recently completed 6.3 Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD).  The ATD defined the components of a Plasma Arc Waste Destruction System (PAWDS), tested a prototype system in full scale and successfully demonstrated that the technology was viable for shipboard application. The developer of the ATD PAWDS, PyroGenesis Inc. (PGI), has an exclusive licensing agreement with NSWCCD-Carderock to market the PAWDS commercially and is partne rs with NSWCCD-Carderock on a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) that allows the Navy access to all data from the commercial development of the patent.  Since the completion of the ATD, the contractor has been actively marketing the PAWDS and recently finalized the sale of a system to a commercial cruise line company.   PGI, under a previous Navy contract, also recently supported the Navy's assessment of the technical status of the commercial PAWDS.    This follow-on contract will task PGI to provide engineering services, facilities, materials, manufacturing equipment and personnel needed to support the Navy's continued refinement and assessment of the contractor's commercial PAWDS.  This includes the implementation and evaluation of several system refinements identified and designed during previous contracts to make the system suitable for shipboard appl ication.  The contract will consist of a one-year base contract and a single one-year option.  In the first year under the base contract, the Navy ATD system will be reconfigured and upgraded with new equipment components to produce a land-based prototype system representative of the contractor's shipboard design.  If the Navy chooses to exercise the option , the system will be thoroughly tested and evaluated in the second year of the contract to determine it's operability, reliability, maintainability and process rate and ensure it meets shipboard requirements for safety, shock, vibration, EMI and noise.  These efforts will be used to provide PMS 378, the program sponsor, with data and a validated design to support forward fit of the technology aboard CVN 21.   See Note 22.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, intends to award a sole-source, firm-fixed price contract to FN Herstal, Belgium for the procurement of 80 M3M .50 Caliber crew-served defensive weapon systems common to U.S. Navy and Marine Corps assault support rotary-wing aircraft.  The M3M .50 caliber weapon system includes the following:  a pintle mounted .50 Caliber Machine Gun with an open bolt design to eliminate cook-off risk, a rate of fire greater than 1000 rounds per minute, a barrel life of 10,000 rounds, weapon depot level maintenance required at no earlier than 40,000 rounds, the capability to use 100, 300 or 600 round ammunition cans, the capability to fire all standard NATO .50 Caliber ammunition to include SABOT ammunition, a total system weight similar to the XM-218 system with no greater than a thirty percent increase in weight, the ability to maintain or increase the available fields of fire for each airframe, and the capability for dismounted operation by 1 person within 2 minutes.  In addition, the weapon system is capable of being mounted on each of the following platforms: CH-46, CH-53, H-60 aircraft to include left and right door mounts for all platforms, a ramp mount for the CH-53, and integration on to the Improved Defensive Armament System (IDAS) for the UH-1 aircraft. The weapon system includes compatibility with Night Vision Device (NVD) capable targeting, pointing and illuminating laser systems.  A soft pintle mount for airframe stress reduction, improved targeting, and improved accuracy is also included.  The operation of the weapon, along with the ammunition handling, feed, and storage system does not require electrical power from the aircraft or any other source.  The scope of the Common Defensive Weapon System (CDWS) contract shall include all of the efforts necessary to manufacture and deliver the 80 systems, to include initial sparing and training of personnel.  In addition, FN Herstal will design and develop the actual interface between airframe and weapon system.  This contract will be issued on a sole source basis to FN Herstal, the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the M3M .50 Caliber weapon system.  FN Herstal was the only respondent to the RFI issued 6 December 2002 whose product successfully met or is capable of meeting the stated requirements.  To award the contract to another vendor would result in excessive duplication of effort and costs to the government.  FN Herstal is also sufficiently poised to respond to a rapid deployment capability should the need arise.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service intends to issue an IDIQ contract for off-site security storage of back-up mission critical information on magnetic media files for the IRS Martinsburg Computing Center (MCC), 250 Murall Drive, Kearneysville, WV.  This is not a request for proposals.  No solicitation is available.  However, the IRS anticipates the release of the solicitation on or about January 28, 2003.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code Number is 493190 (Other Warehousing and Storage).  The Small Business Size Standard is $21.5 million.  The anticipated contract services require a Contractor to provide a secure, remote, off-site storage facility/vault to retain media and to return the media to the designated area at the MCC.  The Government anticipates between 16,000 (Base Period) to 20,000 (Option Period 4) magnetic cartridges (hanging)and approximately 50 storage containers, per month, of paper documents, CDs, DLT tapes, and cassette tapes.  The Contractor shall provide weekly pick-up and transportation services between the MCC location and the Contractor's secure storage facility/vault location of the identified media in the Contractor?s environmentally controlled vehicle.  Unscheduled and emergency deliveries shall also be provided by the Contractor, specifics shall be identified in the solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THE BIDDERS CONFERENCE TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED FOR FEBRUARY 3, 2003, HAS BEEN CANCELED, AND WILL BE RESCHEDULED AT A LATER DATE. PLEASE 
REVIEW OUR WEB SITE FOR FURTHER UPDATES: http://bus.lanl.gov/bus5/


The point of contact for this requirement is Bill Bryant, Senior Contract Administrator.  Address questions via e-mail to bbryant@lanl.gov or phone (505) 667- 7975, fax (505) 665-8841.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), operated by the University of California for the Department of Energy (DOE), is preparing a solicitation to provide design-build services for a light laboratory-office building and general support structure(s). 
The Chemistry & Metallurgy Research Building at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is 50 years old and is scheduled to be inoperative as a nuclear facility in 2010. A replacement facility is proposed to be constructed at Technical Area-55 (TA-55).  The replacement facility is envisioned to consist of a Light Laboratory/Office Building (LLOB), a Security Category I building, a Security Category II building, and support structures to house utilities. A Personnel Intrusion Detection Alarm System (PIDAS) will separate the Security Category I & II buildings from the LLOB and the utility building(s) in the overall project. 
This project is for facilities outside the PIDAS and is identified as the Chemistry & Metallurgy Research Building Replacement Project (CMRR) Light Laboratory/Office Building (LLOB) and the utility structure(s) to support all of CMRR. The project is referred to as LLOB. The LLOB will provide laboratory and office space for approximately 500 personnel. Approximately seventy thousand (70,000) net square feet of office space and twenty thousand (20,000) net square feet of laboratory space will be required in a single building. There are security height restrictions on structures in the vicinity of a PIDAS. Building horizontal dimensions are also restricted. The support structure(s) will house hot water heating, sanitary sewer, and chilled water for the entire CMRR project, not just LLOB. The LLOB main building will include a multi-purpose entrance atrium, separate office areas for un-cleared and "Q"/"L" cleared personnel, chemical laboratories, a food service area, a loading/unloading dock, and areas for expansion of office space. Approximately one-third of the office space will be for un-cleared personnel and two- thirds for "Q"/"L" cleared personnel. Provision for expansion in the support structure(s) is required.
The award of this contract is contingent upon the receipt of funding from the Department of Energy.  Capital funding for this project is expected to become available by September 30, 2003. The University intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract to the successful design-build firm that best meets the Laboratory's goals and objectives contingent upon availability and approval of these funds.
The project will be designed and constructed under a Design-Build contract with an estimated cost of approximately $45M.  Design is scheduled to start November 2003 and be completed by December 2004.  Construction will be completed in December 2005. Department of Energy "Q" or "L" security clearance is not required for work on this project. A LANL-issued badge or authorized escort is required for all personnel on site. The Laboratory's Associate Directorate for Operations will oversee the design and construction of the LL/OB.

Solicitation

If you are interested in participating in this solicitation submit your company name, contact, and phone number by January 24, 2003.  Do not transmit information at this time for the RFQ or RFP.   It will be requested at a later date which will be announced on our Business Web Site: http://bus.lanl.gov/bus5/default.htm approximately January 27, 2003.  We also plan on holding a bidder conference approximately February 3, 2003 to go over this solicitation in more detail.

Selection of the successful offeror for award will be based on a best-value source selection process using a two-phased approach: Phase 1, the Request for Qualifications (RFQ); and Phase 2, the Request for Proposal (RFP).
	
Phase 1, Request for Qualifications. 
To be qualified, each offeror must demonstrate: 
 ?   Prior Experience on similar design-build projects, identifying owner,    point of contact, telephone number. 
? Proposed project team organization
?    Resumes of Key Personnel with applicable experience, availability,    and commitment to this project.
?   Quality compliance capability to 10 CFR 830.120
?   A notable safety record compared to National Safety Council statistics
?   Evidence of financial stability, including Dunn & Bradstreet rating
?   Corporate, Key Personnel and Subcontractor Teaming Experience
? Capability to perform construction utilizing local labor and materials
 
Qualifications Statements will be due approximately February 19, 2003.  


Phase 2, Request for Proposals

This will be a best value competition for the design and construction.  The RFP is scheduled to be issued approximately April 7, 2003 to about 3 short listed finalists from the RFQ process. Firms receiving the RFP will receive performance specifications upon which to base a Conceptual Design. Firms will have over two months to prepare design sketches, outline facility functions/adjacencies, and to demonstrate hardware and software capabilities.

<DESC>Notice of Contract Action (NOCA). A Sources Sought Synopsis was released on 19 November 2002, with no amendments, under the project title Air Force Nuclear Weapons and Counterproliferation Agency (NWCA), Kirtland AFB NM. This announcement is to notify all interested parties that Det 8 Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at Kirtland AFB, NM is seeking to award a small business set-aside contract for the upcoming NWCA effort and anticipates releasing a solicitation F29601-03-R-0001 on or about 9 January 2003 entitled Air Force Nuclear Weapons and Counterproliferation Agency (NWCA) Support. NWCA has primary technical and programmatic Air Force responsibility for Department of Defense (DoD) and National Nuclear Security Agency-Department of Energy (NNSA-DOE) nuclear weapon and counterproliferation activities. Activities include: (1) weapon effectiveness analysis, systems design and evaluations, and operational studies for counterforce strikes against chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE) and other asymmetric threats; (2) CBRNE target and intelligence assessments; (3) nuclear weapon modifications assessments, life extension assessments, system and component analysis, and management from operational deployment through retirement; (4) technical and programmatic oversight, technical interchange participation and documentation including summary reports of Nuclear Weapons Project Officers Groups (POGs). Nuclear weapon and counterproliferation solution concepts are developed and fielded through the USAF, DoD, and DOE acquisition processes to meet user requirements and ensure continued mission readiness, operation, and reliability certification throughout their lifetime.  Interaction between the USAF, DoD, and DOE agencies occurs through integrated product teams led by AF NWCA. To support this objective, NWCA is interested in augmenting their technical and engineering expertise in the following major areas, to be performed at the contractors facility and on-site at NWCA, Kirtland AFB, NM: (A) program management, (B) engineering, (C) scientific, (D) computational, (E) analysis, (F) testing, (G) technical reporting/documentation, (H) targeting/intelligence, (I) office administration and (J) network administration.  The primary objective of the overall effort is the integration of all these areas to support NWCA programs such as nuclear stockpile sustainment and life extension; agent defeat weapons concept development; and targeting and collateral effects tools development and application. Due to possible office space constraints at NWCA, the effort may have to be performed off-base at the contractors facility. Therefore, the contractor facility must be located within a 50-mile radius of NWCA, Kirtland AFB, NM. A draft RFP will not be issued for the acquisition; however, RFP attachments will be made available for viewing at the FedBizOpps website http://www.fedbizopps.gov prior to release of the RFP.  Offerors responding to this announcement are encouraged to monitor closely the website for potential changes to the acquisition. Offerors are also encouraged to register under the FedBizOpps Interested Vendors List (IVL). The list will allow vendors to register their interest in the solicitation and will be monitored and accessed by AFRL/PKVE personnel. Amendments and questions and answers concerning the announcement will be posted exclusively at the FedBizOpps website. All posted information will clearly display its date of posting. Offerors are reminded of the requirement to acknowledge all amendments (if any) in their proposal. This acquisition will be solicited as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. Small business offerors submitting proposals should indicate whether they are a small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned small business or an HBCU/MI. Any resulting efforts will fall under NAICS Code 541710, with a size standard of 1,000 employees. A cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) completion type contract is contemplated. It is anticipated that the contractual effort will consist of one (1) award and will be a two (2) year basic effort with three (3) one-year priced option periods. The anticipated funds available for this effort are not anticipated to exceed $16.2M. Proposals will be due thirty days after the RFP release date. An organizational conflict of interest clause is anticipated in any resultant contract. Reference AFMC FAR Clause 5352.209-9002, Organizational Conflict of Interest (Jul 1997). The security classification of the contract is anticipated to be TOP SECRET/SCI. Foreign-owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or program manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award. Only offerors certified by the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) may submit offers. Contact US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS, Federal Center, 74 Washington Avenue, North, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084, (1-888) 352-9333, http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/, for further information on certification and the approval process. Offerors are required to either submit a copy of the DLIS approved DD Form 2345 with their proposal or to the Contracting Officer, if access to unclassified, limited distribution data is required to prepare the proposal. All offerors must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration (CCR) to be eligible to receive a contract award. All offerors must register on a one-time basis and annually confirm accuracy and completeness of registration information. Instructions for CCR can be accessed at http://www.ccr.dlsc.dla.mil.

<DESC>Training Transformation, mandated OSD, will require the integration of training, not only across training systems, but also as an inseparable element in DoDs new system of systems environment.  As such, the Department must identify interfaces between training systems and acquisition, logistics, personnel, military education, and command and control processes, and ensure training is integrated into these processes.  Interoperable net-centric training capabilities, such as embedded simulations, job-performance aids, and integrated simulators and training devices, will be elevated as priorities within the acquisition process.  Acquisition processes will be modified to include training requirements as a key performance parameter or a similar forcing function construct to ensure cost-benefit trade offs inherent to the design of new military systems and equipment explicitly considering interoperable, net-centric training systems and testing.  Training will be tracked in a manner similar to that of key performance parameters throughout the acquisition process.  

NAVAIRSYSCOM has a requirement for development and revision of guiding documents and training support in their use to inform DoD training system acquisition managers and developers in the improvement of acquisition process and training system effectiveness to meet the strategic OSD goal cited above.

The products will include analysis of education and training technology and processes,  incorporation of human performance factors across the processes, insertion of technology, and streamlining of the Instructional Systems Development (ISD)/Systems Approach to Training (SAT) process.  The effort will include the development of training system acquisition and development guidance products that include DoD training Military Standards, Specifications, and Handbooks, electronic performance support systems, and other aids for training managers and developers.  This effort will also include market research of best ISD business practices related to the ISD/SAT, interactive multimedia instruction, advanced distributed learning, distributed mission training, and trainer acquisition processes.  It will include independent verification and validation of computer-based training and education courses and products, analysis of industry training processes and potential application for DoD training and education.  It will also include guidance for identification of required human performance measures and opportunities for embedded training early in the acquisition process. 

The joint services ISD/SAT and training acquisition policies emerged out of long-term debates within the Defense Training System Working Group (DTSWG) to arrive at consensus on best practices. The Contractor must have been actively involved in that deliberative process to ensure a seamless transition to emerging acquisition and development initiatives. The Contractor must additionally have experience in the authoring and revision of the current guiding documents.  Successful performance of this contract will require extensive knowledge of and experience with MIL-PRF-29612, MIL-HDBK-29612, related DIDs, MIL-PRF-XXXX and MIL-HDBK-XXXX for trainers and job-aids for enhancing their usefulness.  In addition to the above the contractor must have knowledge of and experience in documenting process and products related to the following:

1)	Researching emerging training technology
2)	Applying innovative processes for evaluating these technologies for applicability for implementation across the Joint Services
3)	Synthesizing these processes into performance specifications and guidance documentation suitable for use in Government procurements is essential. 
4)	Datamining
5)	Section 505 Compliance
6)	Measurement and evaluation of training effectiveness
7)	Weapons Systems and Training Systems Acquisition
8)	Systems Engineering
9)	Human Systems Integration
10)	Human Systems Engineering
11)	IMI/ADL SCORM production procquisition policies emerged out of long-term debates within the Defense Training Standard Working Group (DTSWG) to arrive at consensus on best practices. Accordingly, participation with the DTSWG in that deliberative process and development/revision of the documents will be weighted factors for source selection.

<DESC>DISREGARD PREVIOUS REVISION AS THE SUMMARY REVERTED TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS -----              

REF A: Strategic Plan for Transforming DOD Training, March 1, 2002, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Director, Readiness and Training Policy and Programs
REF B: MIL-PRF-29612B Performance Specification, Training Data Products
REF C: DI-SESS-81517B through DI-SESS-81527B Data Item Descriptions (DIDs)
REF D: MIL-HDBK-29612-1A through 5A Guidance for the acquisition and fielding of training systems
I. BACKGROUND: Training Transformation, mandated by OSD in REF A, will require the integration of training, not only across training systems, but also as an inseparable element in DODs new ?system of systems? environment. As such, the Department must identify interfaces between training systems and acquisition, logistics, personnel, military education, and command and control processes, and ensure training is integrated into these processes. Interoperable net-centric training capabilities, such as embedded simulations, job-performance aids, and integrated simulators and training devices, will be elevated as priorities within the acquisition process. Acquisition processes will be modified to include training requirements as a key performance parameter or a similar forcing function construct to ensure cost-benefit trade offs inherent to the design of new military systems and equipment explicitly considering interoperable, net-centric training systems and testing. Training will be tracked in a manner similar to that of key performance parameters throughout the acquisition process.        
II. PROBLEM: The Performance Specification (REF B) and associate DIDs (REF C) do not address Human Systems Integration (HSI) and are inadequate in their treatment of human capability and performance. The guidance for acquiring and developing/providing training products/services in REF D is similarly deficient. Moreover, REFs B, C and D need to be updated to reflect best business practices, latest technology and standard industry terminology related to fielding effective human performance-oriented training. III. ANTICIPATED CONTRACT: NAVAIRSYSCOM has a requirement for revision of REFs B, C, and D, (and additional volumes if required) and training support in their use. NAVAIR Orlando anticipates awarding an indefinite quantity/delivery type contract to the selected Contractor. A single source will be selected to ensure seamless integration of best practices across the volumes. The Government anticipates a Not-to-Exceed $5M contract over a 60-month period. Detailed requirements for specific tasks will be issued as firm-fixed price/cost plus fixed fee delivery orders for a task or combination of tasks under the contract.  IV. RESEARCH REQUIRED: Prior to product development, market research must be conducted of best business practices concerning relevant research and emerging processes related to Instructional Systems Development (ISD)/Systems Approach to Training (SAT); incorporation of HSI factors across those processes; insertion of technology; and acquisition of effective human performance-oriented training. Of special interest is embedded training; interactive multimedia instruction; advanced distributed learning; distributed mission training; media analysis and analysis of alternative training systems (including cost-benefit); human performance measures; and verification and validation of computer-based courseware. Analysis must be conducted to evaluate the potential for application of the identified best practices within REFs B, C, and D. V. CAPABILITIES REQUIRED: Successful performance of this contract will require extensive knowledge of and experience with REFs B, C, and D. The ability to synthesize identified best business practices into performance specifications and guidance documentation suitable for use in Government procurements will be essential.  The joint services ISD/SAT and training acess

<DESC>Here are the answers to the questions we've been asked about this notice.  No changes have been made to this notice by this modification.  This modification is simply to provide more information.>>>>>>>>>>>> Question 1. Is reduction of cost the primary goal of the automation effort. Is the existing live agent service satisfactory? Answer - Reduction in cost and manpower are contributing factors, as well as the idea of optimizing what our operators are doing now.  The existing live operator service is satisfactory but boring.  Question 2. Are these calls primarily originated externally or are a signicicant number originated internally? Answer - Calls to the operator originate both externally and internally.  Any automated system must be able to handle each equally well.  Question 3. The vocabulary specification of 5,000 words/phrases is not definitive. It is 
assumed that the vocabulary relates to the number of directory entries which in turn relates to the number personel that are attempted to be located. How many is this and what sort of information is provided for each entry? Answer - The sum of 5,000 is an estimate only.  The primary purpose of an automated system will be to connect callers to a functional office or service, not a person.  For example, a caller may want the number for the BX, PX, Base Exchange.  All three terms are for the same place.  Or, the caller may want pediatrics, or peds.  Both should send the caller to the child care clinic.  If the caller asks for the commander it must ask the caller to differentiate.  Question 4. An existing "base locator function" is identified. It is assumed that the system would be required to interface with it. Is this so? Answer - No.  Due to security issues with interfacing legacy systems all that's needed is for the system to be able to import a "text" file and provide text to speech service.  Question 5. Does this project require Speech Recognition technology? Answer - Yes.  The only other alternative would be to use "touch tone" signaling.  That causes us to have to develop menuing options for a caller to navigate through.  I want to minimize the number of levels and options for the caller to have to choose from.  Question 6. The Synopsis states, "There are six telephone operators working during the busiest hours of the day." Will the Government accept a 12 Virtual Operator capacity (which is less than 24) but with the expandability to 24 ports. Please consider that the 24 channels of one T-1 carrier can be used for both Inbound and Outbound calls (if needed).  Answer - I will consider 12 virtual operators.  That is a significant improvement over the number of operators working at busy hour now.  The initiative to specify a T-1 ensures the system has significantly more capacity and minimizes the number of circuits connected between the CO and the voice automation system.  Individual circuits would require an analog "dialogic" card per channel and would be limited to the services of an analog channel.  A T-1, specifically a Primary Rate ISDN circuit, opens up features and functions not available to an analog circuit.  Question 7. Requirement 3, "Base Locator function". Please provide the approximate number of Base Sites and personnel telephone numbers to be included. Answer - I'm not sure of the exact number.  The sources sought is intended to help me understand what is possible and what it costs.  The number 5,000 is an estimate but is pretty close.  Question 8. Will the Government allow access for Automated Voice Processing Systems
to access the Government Database that contains the Base Locator Information? Answer - No.  The system must import a "Text" file and provide text to speech service.  Question 9. Will the operators need to provide Nationwide Directory Assistance
service, similar to those available through a commercial 411 telephone service? Answer - No.  Question - 10. Will the system need to provide fully automated voice recognition of (a) base personnel names and (b) nationwide population names? Answer - Base Personnel only.  This system will not need nationwide.  Question 11. In the absence of voice recognition, can a successful system provide the requested name to the operator through a "record and whisper" solution? Answer - My applogy, but I don't know what a "record and whisper" solution is.  I'm primarily interested in voice recognition because it will give immediate service without need of elaborate "touch tone" menu's and recordings.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is actively soliciting information and comments related to Health Data Repositories that have been developed and are currently in use (latest commercially available products; not to include products in beta testing) that will support a full scale Computer based Patient Record (CPR) suite developed by VHA (CPRS-R), including real time order entry and results reporting. The application must have the ability to support multiple clinical domains including lab, pharmacy, progress notes, and health factors (see table at the end for full domain listing). The application must also have the ability to normalize/standardize this data into a longitudinal electronic medical record that holds the combined clinical data of millions of VA patients seen across over one thousand points of inpatient and outpatient care.=20 Interoperability of the clinical data between VHA and the Department of Defense(DoD) is a key driver of this initiative.  DoD is using the 3M HDR and VA requires that the VA HDR must at least meet that level of functionality and be able to share standardized datasets with DoD's repository. This requirement is based on the two data dictionaries needing to be normalized to recognize each other's data.  Respondees should provide architectural models that describe how they provide longitudinal views of the patient record while assuring local access to patient information (continuity of operations in case of equipment/telecommunications failures). The following are also requirements of the current system: Oracle based Preferred transaction management: Tuxedo and/or Web Logic Primary Usage: Mixed (both inpatient and outpatient across multiple physical locations) Middle Tier Approach: Services -based Server Technology: Single Oracle DB Please review the Gartner report dated 15 October 2002 for details on the existing system. THIS IS NOT A FORMAL SOLICITATION, NOR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, AND THERE IS NO INTENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT BASED ON THE INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT OR FROM ANY PRESENTATION AT A CONFERENCE. ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, MUST REFERENCE VA101-03-03 AND SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO mailto:Chris.burroughs@mail.va.gov The information being collected will be used by VA to identify products have been developed and are in use and that may meet VA=92s technical and business requirements.  It is expected that responders who best meet these requirements will be invited to demonstrate their products. Information and comments should be furnished to the Department of Veterans Affairs, mail to: Chris.Burroughs@mail.va.gov no later than January 29th, 2003.  Your responses should be provided by mail or e-mail.  All comments and information must reference RFI VA101-03-03.

<SOLNBR>F19628-03-R-0024
<RESPDATE>032103
<ARCHDATE>09212003
<CONTACT>Bill Donaldson, Contracting Officer, 781-271-6091
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)AND NOT A SOLICITATION.  The Government is requesting information from companies working on terminal system designs for free space optical communications for air-to-air and air-to-space applications.  The Government is also interested in receiving information from component vendors whose subsystems and critical components are useful in the development of free space optical communications.  The Government wishes to determine potential sources for the development of an airborne Lasercom Terminal.  INTRODUCTION:  The Air Force is initiating the development of a Lasercom Terminal Program in FY03, with an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) to coincide with the first launch of the Transformational Satellite (TSAT) in FY09.  An airborne Lasercom Terminal is required to support both air-to-air and air-to-space communications for High Altitude Endurance (HAE) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft and Command and Control (C2) aircraft.  This terminal must provide an initial data rate in excess of 2.4 Gbps in each direction, with a path to achieve a data rate capability in excess of 40 Gbps in each direction.  In support of this mission, the MILSATCOM Terminals (ESC/MC) Systems Program Office (SPO) is performing a market survey of free space optical communications options.  This RFI will be used by ESC/MC in the development of a Lasercom Program.  SCOPE:  The purpose of this RFI is to gather information to support an RFP release at the end of FY '03, and to determine industry interest in participating in this effort.  The potential developers should understand that validated and firm requirements for the Lasercom Terminal do not yet exist.  Rather, they will evolve over time as the technology evolves and matures, and the technical requirements, user requirements and concept of operations (CONOPS) are completely defined during fiscal year 2003. ESC/MC will use the information gathered in response to this RFI to gain an understanding of potential approaches to meet USAF Lasercom Terminal System requirements.  We seek to understand the current state of the art that companies have achieved in airborne free space optical communications, as well as their anticipated future development, and how these might apply to the USAF effort to achieve this capability.  The Government is interested in receiving information from companies working on designs for free space optical communications for air-to-air and air-to-space applications, as well as from component vendors whose subsystems and critical components are useful in the development of the Lasercom Terminal System.  The Government will accept partial responses to this RFI if the party is willing to enter into a partnership/teaming arrangement with another party(s) to supply the Government with a complete airborne Lasercom terminal.  ESC/MC seeks to solicit the interest of vendors, organizations and/or consortia in the following areas of expertise:  1. Aircraft Integration Experience with airborne Electro-optic (E/O) Systems and Equipment.  2. Airborne Communications System Architecture (as applies to optical platforms): Layered Communications, Protocols, Error Detection and Correction, Quality of Service (QoS), Acquisition and tracking algorithms, Supporting software for all of the above.  3. Airborne Electro-optic (E/O) Systems:  Laser communications, Infra-Red Counter-Measures (IRCM), Forward-Looking Infra-Red (FLIR), LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR), Cameras, Surveillance, Contamination and stray light rejection, Optical acquisition and tracking.  4. Components and Subsystems:  Lasers, Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs), Optical amplifiers, Modulators, Detectors (single, multi), Cameras & telescopes, Modems, Diplexing transmit & receive paths, Technology to develop multi-access links from one aperture (within a limited FOV), Beam steering mechanisms, Gimbal mechanisms, Stabilization and control mechanisms.  5. Airborne E/O Systems Experience:  Atmospheric Phenomena, Weather, Scintillation, Scattering, Beam steering, Link Budget; specifically, communications acquisition and track link budgets, to include initial spatial uncertainty, pointing error, etc.  DATA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  The Information package should include the following items: 1. Statement of interest, either as a Prime- or a Sub-contractor/partner/team member.  2. Description of qualification:  Projects, Products, Applicable experience.  3. Strawman concepts that should be investigated: Acquisition concepts, for both air-to-air and air-to-space, Tracking concepts, for both air-to-air and air-to-space, Other concepts as applicable.  4.	Anticipated terminal system development schedule(s): Include consideration of an evolutionary or spiral development.  5. Commentary about the application of optical communications technology to military airborne platforms.  6.	Commentary about practical data rates achievable by free space optical communications:  Is there an ultimate limit communicating through the atmosphere?, Are there practical "steps" for the data rates?  7. Critical technologies and/or hurdles to be cleared.  8. Risks and risk mitigation strategies.  9. Issues or concerns not identified above.  POINT OF CONTACT:  Responses to this RFI are due to Mr. Bill Donaldson by 1700 on 21 March 2003.  Respondents should identify their company's name, address, telephone number, point of contact, and whether they are a large or small business.  Proprietary information should be clearly marked.

SUBJECT:	Market Research Information Request - T-38 Wheel & Brake Upgrade


This Market Research Information Request (RFI) is being sent in advance of an anticipated open distribution Request for Proposal (RFP).  In developing your response you are reminded that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

The demand for the T-38 wheel and brake upgrade is driven by the need to improve the reliability, wear life, performance and safety of the existing T-38 brake, also to improve the reliability of the existing wheel and incorporate radial tire technology. The demand for this upgrade will as well support anticipated weapon system gross weight increases.  

The T-38 fleet is expected to remain in service until the year 2024.  There are currently (585) airplanes in active service in the United States (USAF, NASA, and Navy).  An estimated 1,521 brakes and 1800 wheels will be required for initial provisioning and spares.

Information provided by respondents will help ensure that an RFP is prepared with satisfactory information.  Preliminary wheel and brake requirements are provided in this RFI as guidelines.  

REQUESTED INFORMATION

1)	Please provide a description of wheel and brake upgrade concept(s) that would meet the preliminary requirements. The Air Force will consider all proposed concepts prior to establishing the program direction of any future T-38 wheel and brake upgrade program.  Please provide concept layout drawings that highlight key features, and include a summary of the impact of the proposed design on related systems (i.e., hydraulics, addition of anti-skid, etc.).
2)	A radial tire option will be available for the T-38 in the near future.  Please comment on the advantages and disadvantages to qualifying a wheel for use with both tire types?
3)	Please provide an estimated dry weight (new and worn) for an upgraded wheel and brake.
4)	Please provide the estimated brake wear life and time (cycles) between wheel overhauls.
5)	For how many years should a brake be designed to remain on an airplane axle before corrosion, hydraulic leaks, oxidation, etc., become problems?
6)	Please provide a top-level program schedule that highlights major program milestones between program launch and flight test equipment delivery.  The objective is to provide information that will identify development phases and deliverables, and will provide a general understanding of the amount of time required for development of the equipment.  Where necessary please state assumptions.  For example, assumed qualification test requirements should be stated in support of a schedule estimate.
7)	In terms of production capacity, please identify and discuss what should be assumed as a reasonable amount of time to retrofit the fleet with an upgraded wheel and brake.  From a supplier perspective, please identify issues and problems related to a fleet retrofit with the best ways to resolve or mitigate those issues and problems.  From a supplier perspective, please provide advantages and disadvantages of a time compliant retrofit in comparison to a retrofit by attrition.
8)	Please estimate the following for the T-38 wheel and brake upgrade:
-	Number of Full Stop Landings to achieve a 100% worn brake-	Landings per wheel-	Maximum number of wheel overhauls-	Years to develop & qualify new wheel and brake-	Years to retrofit fleet-	Development costs-	MLG wheel cost (initial provisioning)-	MLG wheel cost (after initial provisioning)-	Brake assembly cost (initial provisioning)-	Brake assembly cost (after initial provisioning)-	Heat sink cost (after initial provisioning)-	Man-hours to build up wheel/tire assembly and install wheel and brake -	Additional heat sink mass required to complete 100% worn brake RTO at the brake energy, inertia, and decel rate described below.
9)	What other critical program issues/problems would you anticipate and what could be done to address them?

The beam radius at the optic I estimate to be from 1-1.5mm.  The coating will also reflect 10-20W CW at approximately 1 micron and anybody?s guess at approximately 1.5 microns, perhaps 30W CW.  This is fairly low irradiance as it is continuous wave operation.

<SUBJECT>Y -- Renovation Design-Build Construction project to convert the 469th Contingency Hospital Complex in Frankfurt, Germany to the site for the location of the US Consulate.
<DESC>THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE (DOS), Office of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) is seeking to prequalify firms for a Renovation Design-Build Construction project in Frankfurt, Germany.  The Department anticipates award of a Firm Fixed-Price contract.  The purpose of the project is to convert the 469th Contingency Hospital Complex, previously operated and maintained by the US Department of Defense, to the site for the location of the US Consulate, Frankfurt, Germany.  The project will be design-build.  The US Government will provide bridging documents.  The 469th Contingency Hospital includes over 70,000 gross square meters (GSM).  The building is made up of 10 wings, ranging from 2 to 6 stories, plus several small additions on a 10 hectare compound.  Most wings are confined around double loaded corridors.  The original wings were constructed between 1938 and 1943 by the Government of Germany, while later wings were added by the US Government through the 1980s.  The facility was in continuous use as a hospital until 1992, and maintained as a contingency hospital until 2001.

THE PROJECT, WITH MINIMAL WORK, will convert the existing patient rooms into Consulate offices, Consular offices, Marine Security Guard Residence, hotel for people under Government travel orders, Public Diplomacy facilities, auditorium, several personnel access controls and several compound access controls.  The conversion will include telephone, data, power, new boiler, security, and fire protection upgrades.  The project will also include two new warehouses of approximately 7,500 GSM and 1,000 GSM and the Demolition of five temporary buildings.  The magnitude of this project is expected to be from $25 to $35 million..

OFFERORS MUST MEET THE QUALIFICATION CRITERIA during evaluation of offers in order to proceed to Phase II.  The government reserves the right not to make award to any offeror receiving less than a satisfactory rating in all evaluation factors and subfactors.  A specific period of performance will be established within the solicitation document issued during Phase II of this acquisition.

THE TYPES OF DESIGN SERVICES to be provided will include architecture and urban design; structural, civil, energy conservation, mechanical, electrical, seismic and geotechnical engineering, space planning and systems furniture integration, interior design, signage, Technical and Physical security, communications, RF shielding systems design, blast protection design, fire protection engineering, potable water treatment and waste water treatment, landscaping design cost estimating, scheduling, value engineering, and administrative coordination of the various disciplines involved.  Construction services will include construction labor and materials to execute the OBO accepted design; on-site organization with management of lines of authority to ensure overall project coordination; and overall control throughout the life of the project.  Required services include required documentation submittals and institution of controlling programs such as:  a quality control program, construction scheduling, cost control, and project closeout services.  The work must comply with applicable U.S. Government and foreign codes, regulations, and standards.  Building design submission shall use hard metric units (Systems International).  Design submission phases will be identified in the Phase II solicitation and will include Design Development submittal, Diplomatic Security Certification Package submittals, Construction Document, submittal and Final Construction Document submittal.  Design deliverables shall include construction drawings in AutoCad Rel 13 and 14, specifications, schedule of rates/bills of quantity, reports and calculations.

THIS SOLICITATION WILL CONSIST OF TWO PHASES; this CBD announcement is for Phase One.  As a result of evaluations of submittals sent in response to Phase I, the Department will first determine which offerors satisfy the Mandatory Prequalification Requirements and will then rate those offerors based on the requirements set forth in the following Evaluation Factors.  Those offerors receiving a satisfactory evaluated rating from the technical board will be issued a formal solicitation and invited to submit a proposal in accordance with Phase II solicitation requirements. If more than six satisfactory Phase I packages are received for any one project, the Government reserves the right to limit Phase II to the six best qualified offerors.  The submissions in response to the Phase II formal solicitation shall be in the formats prescribed by the Department and will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation procedures contained in the solicitation.  Due to time constraints, it is anticipated that the pre-qualified firms will be required to participate in visits to the project sites within 10 to 15 days after the issuance of the design/build RFP. To offset some of the cost of the site visits and other related costs, pre-qualified firms that do not receive the design/build award will be paid $25,000 for each responsive project proposal they submit in Phase Two. 

MANDATORY PREQUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
FIRMS INTERESTED IN BEING CONSIDERED FOR PRE-QUALIFICATION MUST meet the definition of a United States Person of Section 402 of the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 - Public Law  99-399.  Each company responding to this notice shall contact the Contract Specialist for a copy of the pamphlet, Certifications Relevant To Public Law 99-399, Statement of Qualifications for Purpose of Section 402 of The Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986.  The pamphlet must be completed and included as part of the pre-qualifications package.  A General Construction or Design/Build firm is expected as lead team member.  That lead company is the one that must complete the pamphlet so that we can verify the firm's status as a US person.  If a joint venture is formed, the company having 51 percent or greater interest in the JV must be the one completing the pamphlet.  This is a pass/fail evaluated area.  Offerors must receive a pass rating in this area before proceeding to the next step in the evaluation process.

IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE TO PERFORM UNDER THIS CONTRACT the prequalified firm(s), including all entities which comprise a joint venture, must possess or be able to obtain a Department of Defense (DoD) Secret facility security clearance (FCL) with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M.  Specifically designated personnel requiring access to classified information must also possess a Secret personnel security clearance issued by Defense Security Service (DSS).  Offerors already possessing the necessary FCL should submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with the required prequalification documentation.  If a prequalified firm does not possess the necessary DoD FCL, the Department of State will sponsor the firm for an FCL at the time they are determined to be prequalified.  All firms must comply with security requirements detailed in the NISPOM.  Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance.  The Government will not be obligated to extend its solicitation schedule, or to make an award to a sponsored, prequalified firm, if that firm has not been issued an FCL within 90 days of notification of their prequalification.  A joint venture formed by firms bidding on this effort must be issued an FCL.  Firms will not receive the classified portions of the RFP until they have been issued the appropriate FCL and received DSS approval to safeguard classified documents.

Offerors that meet the requirements described above are required to submit the documentation as described in the following evaluation factors.
