<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR SLOTTED WAVEGUIDE TECHNOLOGY (SWAT)!!

The Radar Systems Program Office for The United States Marine Corps (USMC), Marine Corps System Command (MCSC), Battle Space Management and Air Defense Systems (BMADS) Product Group Directorate is soliciting proposals for the development of slotted waveguide technology toward producing a radar system that utilizes D-Band (1215-1400 MHz) in the detection of multiple targets accurately in range, azimuth, and elevation from a single coherent dwell (mono-pulse).  Sources responding to this request shall provide specific information leading to the research and development of a Slotted Waveguide Technology (mono-pulse phased array) Advanced Development Model (SWaT ADM) that provides the single hit accuracies in azimuth and elevation as identified in the 3-D Long Range Radar (LRR) Operational Requirements Document.  The Slotted Waveguide technology covered by this BAA is not limited to any specific radar system but may include the AN/TPS-59(V)3.  
The development and testing of prototype systems/subsystems to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing a slotted waveguide, mono-pulse phased array approach to meet the Marine Corps? performance requirements shall be a two-phased effort.  Phase I shall consist of build and test activities in order to provide a higher confidence level for Phase II activities.  Phase II is planned as a sole source follow-on effort to the Phase I contractor, that capitalizes on the results of Phase I and shall result in the development and demonstration of a full-scale development model.  Phase II activities shall commence upon successful completion of Phase I activities and the demonstration that the SWaT (mono-pulse phased array approach) meets the Marine Corps? performance requirements.  This BAA covers the activities of Phase I which shall result in a less than full scale (See Note) SWaT ADM that demonstrates RF technology, which employs a slotted waveguide mono-pulse technology that results in single hit accuracy in azimuth, range and elevation in a single dwell commensurate with the threats of the current AN/TPS-59(V)3 radar engages.   
Note:  The less than full scale ADM shall be fully physically dimensioned to demonstrate it meets Marine Corps mobility requirements.  The prototype shall incorporate those subsystems/components required to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technology.

The mission of the slotted waveguide mono-pulse phased array system technology is to provide risk reduction in the development of a SWaT ADM as a suitable replacement for current Marine Corps long-range, solid state, three-dimensional (range, bearing and target altitude), ground based surveillance radar which operates in the D band (1215-1400 MHZ) frequency range. The primary components of a current system include a modular, mechanically rotated, phased array antenna, an electronics shelter, a power distribution box and a decoy system. The AN/TPS-59(V)3 operates in three modes: Air Breathing Targets, Theater Ballistic Missile, and Combined.

The three-dimensional (3-D) long-range radar is to be employed by the Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC) with the Tactical Air Operations Module (TAOM) in its role as the Anti-air Warfare (AAW) agency of the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS) of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF).  The 3-D long-range radar is the MAGTF?s primary means of detecting, identifying, tracking, and reporting on all aircraft and missiles within the MAGTF?s area of responsibility.  The radar must provide the MACCS with a real-time display of all air activity and must be rugged enough to support a wide range of tactical operations in all types of weather and terrain conditions.

The 3-D long-range radar must provide anti-air Warfare units of the aviation combat element with sufficient advanced warning and target information to allow for threat evaluation and responsive action, including air raid warningof targeted forces and neutralization of the threat.  The radar must provide air controllers with a precise, true air picture of sufficient quality to conduct close control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions.  The logistical footprint of the radar system must be reduced as technology permits.  Downsizing is the key to improved transportability and reduced setup time.  In the case of TMD operations, the radar must have the capability, in the interim, to disseminate target information to the ADCP and, in the near agencies (Marine Corps and Joint Services) and Surface to Air Missile (SAM) firing batteries (Marine Corps and Joint Services) by the way of a common digital data link.  The mature system must provide target information to the Marine Corps SAM system.  The radar must contribute to the MAGTF?s ability to integrate air defense assets, both with the Marine Corps and across a joint interface.  In support of its TMD role, the sensor must improve target processing capabilities and improve survivability.

Offerors are encouraged to use teaming to leverage existing production programs.  Offerors must understand and have experience with the USMC operational environment including the detection and tracking of complex theater ballistic missiles.  The Offeror must have secure facilities for working with classified information and fabricating classified hardware and software up to the secret level. The Three Dimensional Long Range Radar Operational Requirements Document (Number CCC 11.6) and MIL-R-29466D (dated 15 April, 2000) system specification for the United States Marine Corps Radar Set, AN/TPS-59(V)3 shall be available for viewing at Northrop Grumman Information Technologies, 2848 Jefferson Davis Highway, Suite 102, Stafford, Virginia 22554 between the hours of 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM during the effective period of this announcement.  NO REPRODUCTIONS OF ANY DOCUMENTS SHALL BE MADE AVAILABLE.  Security clearances can be forwarded to Ms. Sharon Carr, Security Officer, voice (540) 657-5165, fax (540) 657-4439, email scarr@logicon.com.  

The Government reserves the right to select one, more than one, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement via a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.  The value of the expected firm-fixed price contract award is approximately $5,700,000, to include any GFP and Government Facilities.  No award can be made without a proposal to perform a specific research effort within an estimated cost and time framework. The offeror selected to demonstrate its Slotted waveguide mono-pulse technology may or may not eventually be selected to be the developer or production contractor for the slotted waveguide mono-pulse technology systems.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) anticipates award of a Firm-Fixed Price Design/Build contract with award fees for the design and construction of a medium security Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) to be located in Pollock, Louisiana.  The scope of work includes all architectural, engineering, construction, and other related services necessary to provide the new federal correctional facility.  The proposed institution is currently planned to consist of a group of buildings in a campus plan arrangement with related site development and site utilities.  The FCI will have a gross building area of approximately 56,000 square meters and be designed to house approximately 1,100 inmates.  The Design-Build Base contract award will be for design and schedule development services, and is anticipated for approximately late Summer of 2002.  The option for major construction is anticipated in late Fall 2002 and subject to funding availability for fiscal year 2003.   The estimated magnitude of this project is expected to exceed $75,000,000.  For consideration on this project, the offeror, at a minimum, must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, in successfully and satisfactorily completing a project of similar size and scope.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.  For the design member of the design-build team, the Architect/Engineer firm or the principal or lead A/E firm of a joint venture, must have an existing active office, which will have responsibility for the plans and specifications, located within the State of Louisiana.  The design of the architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, life safety, security electronics or other engineering features of the project shall be accomplished or reviewed and approved by architects and engineers registered in the State of Louisiana to practice in the particular professional field involved.  Participation by architects, engineers, consultants, suppliers and subcontractors located within the State of Louisiana is encouraged.  Participation by small, small-disadvantaged, HUBZone small businesses, small woman-owned businesses, veteran-owned businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses is also encouraged.   The successful offeror will be required to submit a subcontracting plan for this procurement regarding the utilization of small, small-disadvantaged, small woman-owned businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  The FBOP will be utilizing two-phase Design-Build selection procedures.  The Phase One solicitation will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Hard copies of the Phase One solicitation document will not be available.  The web site provides downloading instructions.  All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this web site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the web site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition.  This notice is not a request for proposals.  Phase One solicitations will be issued on or about April 12, 2002.  The Phase One proposal due date will be identified in the Phase One solicitation.  The Phase One solicitation will provide the scope of work, evaluation factors (Past Performance, Capability to Perform, Specialized Experience and Technical Competence, and Technical Approach) and submission information for interested Design-Build firms to prepare their Phase One qualification proposals.  Phase One qualification proposals  will be evaluated to determine which firms will be selected as offerors for Phase Two.  Phase Two participants will submit competitive past performance, technical, small business and price proposals as defined in the Phase Two solicitation.  The Phase Two evaluation factors (Past Performance, Preliminary Design and Proposed Technical Solutions, Proposed Organization and Key Personnel, Management and Scheduling Approach, Small Business Subcontracting, and Quality Assurance and Quality Control) are significantly more important than price, however, as proposals become more equal, price becomes more important and may be a determining factor for award.

Miller, Contracting Officer, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Construction Contracting Section, 320 First Street, NW, 500-6, Washington, DC 20534.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Developmental & Metabolic Neurology Branch (DMNB) plans to procure a Q-Sweat/ATLAS package from WR Medical Electronics, 123 North Second Street, Stillwater, MN 55082.   The DMNB is studying the sweating defect in patients with Fabry disease in response to therapies.  Fabry disease is caused by an enzyme deficiency, which causes an accumulation of a certain type of lipid in the body.  This excess lipid interferes with the function of many organs in the body.  Measuring the output of sweat from the patients is the only way to assess the effects of specific therapies.  The Q-Sweat is a four-channel system with an integral dry air source, it uses room air so no special gasses are required.  The instrument can measure simultaneously from 4 different areas in the body, the amount and rate of sweating.  It measures the spontaneous amount of sweat and maximal sweating response to medication.  It is also the only sweat measurement devise known to the end user that is FDA approved for use in humans.  This instrument is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  WR Medical Electronics is the only organization known to the NINDS researcher that has aforementioned features that are required and believed to be unique. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement and the noted features, including FDA approval for use in humans, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NINDS researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EST, on March 26, 2002.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .   It is the vendors responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.   NAICS 334516

Design will include construction drawings, plans and specifications sufficient to solicit bids from construction contractors for project implementation.  The design firm will perform construction oversight and guidance to ensure the desired outcome.  Estimated construction cost range is between $250,000-500,000. Qualified firms desiring consideration shall submit SF 255, including organizational chart of key personnel to be assigned to this project, current SF 254 and consultant's current SF 255s not later than the close of business (4 p.m.) on the due date.

<RESPDATE>041602
<ARCHDATE>08312002
<CONTACT>Rick Murray, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 366-4250, Fax (202) 366-3705, Email rick.murray@fhwa.dot.gov
<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration, in association with the US Coast Guard, National Geodetic Survey, and several other Federal agencies, is implementing a High Accuracy Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (HA-NDGPS) capability for test purposes at the Hagerstown, MD, Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS) facility.  The service is expected to be available from April 2002 until April 2003.  Preliminary results indicate that the HA-NDGPS will enable 3-d positioning at an accuracy of 20 cm (95% confidence level) for points located within 200 miles of a single reference station.

A Request for Testers of a High Accuracy Differential GPS (HA-NDGPS) System was posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website on January 17, 2002 (http://www1.eps.gov/spg/DOT/FHWA/OAM/Reference-Number-TFHRC-2002-HANDGPS/Synopsis.html). Up to 4 HA-NDGPS receivers will be loaned to organizations (at no cost to the organization, with no remuneration from the government) to perform tests, for up to a two-month time period during the test period. As a condition of loan, FHWA will require that any data collected be provided to FHWA (with unrestricted data rights) so that further analysis/reporting/documenting of this technique can be accomplished. Electronic proposals from parties interested in testing this technology are being accepted. For more information, see the January 17, 2002 posting. 

To aid potential testers and users in understanding the techniques used for this service, a workshop is planned for April 16, 2002 at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Auditorium.  The purpose of this workshop is to provide industry, academia, and other government agencies with technical details of the High Accuracy NDGPS program.  Technical experts will be available to answer technical questions on this service.

The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson AFB, CO seeks potential sources to design and construct two custom or semi-custom homes on land provided on Peterson AFB, CO.  The two homes will be mirror images of one another and will be limited to 3630 square feet each.  The work will include all items necessary to construct the homes themselves with the addition of providing appliances, some exterior lanscaping work, driveways, and possibly some nimor road construction.  The work listed above should not be considered final nor all-inclusive at this time.  The design and construction services may be provided separately or within a single solicitation, which is yet to determined.  The project magnitude is $500,000 to $1,000,000.  The final schedule for this project has yet to be determined, but it will be developed with anticipation of construction of both homes in calendar year 2003.  The Government anticipates award of a firm fixed-price contract utilizing unrestricted competitive procedures.  A forum to answer inquiries from those who may have interest in this project will be held on 4 April 2002 between 3:00 and 5:00 PM at Holiday Inn (Garden of the Gods), 505 Popes Bluff Terrace.  Further information describing the acquisition and potential contract methods in more detail will be provided at the forum.

<DESC>s facility; however, some tasks may be performed on-site at AFRL/MLS, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH in order to reduce cost and to utilize available specialized test equipment.  Prospective sources will be required to provide a technical staff, as required, that includes highly qualified engineers, technicians, and administrative support engaged in sustainment and development activities on materials and manufacturing processes.  Responses must include the identity and resume of all personnel to be utilized.  Sources must provide documentation of relevant efforts and experience in each of the technical areas described below, which necessitates a quick reaction response to the requirements in a timely manner.  Sources must include specific information related to capabilities in each area that indicates the organization's background, understanding of the problem, and personnel qualifications.  Organizational brochures and letters of interest are unacceptable.  Sources are sought that have the required knowledge and demonstrated capability to conduct and manage quick reaction support programs, as well as materials characterization and emerging materials transition programs of interest to the Materials and Manufacturing Directorate in support USAF and other DoD weapon systems.  The primary objective of this program is to provide quick reaction support to Air Force Major Command field-level activities, System Program Offices, and Air Logistics Centers.  This quick reaction support will include tasks such as failure analysis of structural hardware; failure analysis of electronic components including electrostatic discharge prevention; coatings, corrosion control materials and processes; materials testing and evaluation; composites fabrication, testing, and training; manufacturing test specimens and fixtures; hosting meetings, conferences, and workshops; aerospace and support equipment structural maintenance; and equipment maintenance/upgrades.  The program will investigate materials and processing related issues from the development phase to the production and operational phases of advanced aerospace systems, and will facilitate the transition of emerging materials and processing technologies to all aerospace weapon systems.  This program is multi-disciplinary in that it covers the technology areas of structural materials, electronic materials, corrosion control, protective coatings, nondestructive evaluation, materials testing and evaluation, and logistics support for emerging materials and processes.  The program will initially consist of three (3) delivery orders with the following objectives: (1) increase the understanding of basic physics in the technical areas of Advanced Composites Supportability and Repair Methods, Adhesives and Bonded Repair, Elastomers and Sealants, Electronic Discharge, and Low Observable maintainability, (2) increase the understanding of basic physics that govern x-ray interlock devices, develop testing methodology for collection and validation of data, and develop creative solutions that focus on shielded and remote x-ray operations that meet known regulatory requirements, and (3) increase the understanding of the basic physics that governs the ultrasonic inspection process, use knowledge gained to develop a prototype testbed that demonstrates appropriate testing for collection and validation of data, and recommend a suitable replacement for obsolete centrally procured ultrasonic equipment used to inspect AWAC rotodomes.  Firms responding should indicate whether they are a small business, an 8(a) firm or a HUBZone firm.

<CONTACT>Catherine Connolly, 732-532-1417
<DESC>NA Point of Contact, Peter Smit, Value Concepts Office, (732) 532-8680  THIS IS A PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND CALL FOR PROPOSALS.   The Commercial Operations and Support Savings Initiative (COSSI)   is a program of the Department of Defense (DoD). This announcement   seeks proposals from firms with a concept for inserting commercial   technology into a fielded Army Team Command, Control, Communications,   Computers, Intelligence, Electronic Warfare & Sensors (C4IEWS) military system  for the purpose of lowering the system's Operation and Support (O&S) costs.   Information about Army Team C4IEWS is available on the internet at    http://www.monmouth.army.mil/   COSSI's mission is to reduce DoD Operations and Support (O&S) costs and improve   reliability by routinely inserting commercial items into fielded military systems.   The insertion of commercial items is expected to reduce O&S costs by reducing   the costs of parts and maintenance, reducing the need for specialized   equipment, increasing reliability, and increasing the efficiency   of subsystems. COSSI is a two-stage program. COSSI Stage I   is the Nonrecurring Engineering (NRE), testing and qualification stage.   NRE is the one-time engineering required to adapt the commercial item   for use in a military system. NRE includes developing and implementing   interface, environmental, or performance improvement. NRE may also be required   on the target system to prepare it to receive the kit. Stage I must include any qualification   testing required to demonstrate that the kit will not degrade system-level performance.   COSSI Stage II is the acquisition of production quantities of the kits developed  in Stage I. Proposals should be a clear summary of your   COSSI idea -- what you intend to do and how it will reduce O&S costs,   increase Readiness/Reliability and save DoD money   Proposals will only be accepted from DoD organizations.   Proposals submitted by non-DoD organizations will not be accepted.   A non-DoD organization wishing to take part in the COSSI Program should work with   an appropriate DoD organization and have that organization submit a proposal.   Proposals are due by May 29, 2002 and are to be submitted to AMSEL-AC-CA-RT-V   only by DOD organizations.  Complete program information is included in a document entitled, FY 2003 PROJECT   CALL COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS & SUPPORT SAVINGS   INITIATIVE (REVISED). You are strongly encouraged to obtain the document   in order to understand the program and submit a meaningful proposal.  You may download this document from the INTERNET at:  http://www.acq.osd.mil/es/dut/   or request this document from the COSSI Program Office   by phone: (703) 607-5312 or (703) 607-5323.   Copies of the FY 2003 PROJECT CALL COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS &   SUPPORT SAVINGS INITIATIVE (revised) document with the same title,   without the word (REVISED) following the title, that was available on the OSD   web page prior to March 8, 2002 has been superseded, and should be discarded.

<SOLNBR>DAAE30-02-R-0521
<RESPDATE>050102
<CONTACT>Jacqueline Duffy, Contract Specialist, 973-724-7660
<DESC>The U.S. Army seeks qualified sources to supply grenade (bomblet) fuzes for re-capitalization of 155mm M864 artillery projectiles.  The fuze must meet stringent reliability and safety requirements, comply with Mil Std 1316 and should include a self-destruct feature.  The SDF is for use on M42 and M46 grenades to replace the M223 Fuze.  The interface dimensions for the SDF can be obtained from drawing 12967761. The fuze should be compatible with the existing grenade (drawing 9349370 typical), existing LAP processes, its mode of operation and operational environments.  The fuze must be safety certified in accordance with U.S. standards to assure safety and environmental compliance for testing at U.S. Proving Grounds.  The fuze should not exceed 18 grams maximum in a flight configuration. The fuze should allow for a delay after dispersal from the projectile to permit operation of the primary function upon target engagement. The fuze primary function mode must have a reliability of at least 97% and the combined primary and self-destruct function reliability must result in a dud rate of less than 1%.  It is desired to have the combined primary and self-destruct functions produce a combined dud and neutralized dud rate of 0.2% or less.  A neutralized fuze is defined to be a submunition with the sensitive initiating explosive train elements in the fuze destroyed.  It is desirable to have independent primary and SD features.  Fuzing concepts may be pyrotechnic, mechanical, electronic, etc, or a combination thereof. The projected cost of the fuze should be based on high rate production (about one hundred fifty thousand fuzes per month). The complete and detailed disclosure of the SDF operational sequence with time line, physical dimensions and operational characteristics, the content of the explosive components, is a mandatory requirement for the submitted package to be considered.  The SDF must be a non-developmental item (NDI) item at the time of delivery and fully tested, if such a delivery is required.  Future procurement of production quantities of this fuze may be subjected to limitations of Section 806 of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000.  If so, this would require manufacture of the SDFs in North America.  All U.S. and Allied industry are requested to provide information in their own format that may be of interest to the U.S. Army in identifying potential fuze candidates.  Information may include, but not limited to: design and operational concept including any delay time for the secondary function, any test data, condition, capacity and location of manufacturing facilities, status of any development, estimated unit production costs, and the timeframe for availability of first delivery. Proprietary and/or classified information will be protected as denoted with submission. Responses (printed material, photographs, etc.) must be less than 20 pages and be delivered not later than 30 days from the date of this notice. This information may be mailed to Jacquelin Duffy, Contract Specialist, U.S. Army TACOM ARDEC, Picatinny Center for Contracting and Commerce, AMSTA-AQ-APE  B.10, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000. This market survey is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government. The Government implies no intention or opportunity to acquire funding to support current or future development efforts. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this survey or results of information submitted, and telephone inquires will not be honored. The U.S. Government will not reimburse the costs incurred by providing this information.

<DESC>NA 1.  REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION:  The ALASKA DISTRICT CORPS OF ENGINEERS requests information about the interest and capability of potential offerors for the requirement described below.  A questionnaire regarding the planned solicitation is found at the end of this announcement.  Interested parties are requested to complete the questionnaire and provide comments on the proposed method of selection, contract type, proposed task order limitations, and maximum quantities.  The objective is to achieve maximum com petition, fulfill agency commitment to utilize small disadvantaged businesses, and to simplify and reduce lead-time for procurement of agency requirements through use of a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC).  2.  PROPOSED REQUIREMENT:  THE ALASKA DISTRICT CORPS OF ENGINEERS plans to solicit offers for Design-Build Construction Services and/or Construction Services,  Various Locations, Primarily in Alaska, classified under NAICS category 233. Services planned to  be obtained under this solicitation include design-build construction or construction from Government-furnished design to include but not limited to military family housing; barracks and dormitories; administrative, operations and training facilities; and  industrial facilities. A multiple schedule Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Type (IDIQ) contract is anticipated.  a.  Schedule A shall consist of a 3-year base period of performance for a quantity not to exceed $200,000,000.00 with 2 one-year optional periods of performance not exceed $100,000,000.00 per year.  A $60,000,000.00 maximum ordering limitation per Task Ord er is anticipated with a minimum order amount of $6,000,000.00. Multiple awards are anticipated for Schedule A with two or more contract awards set-aside under the authority of Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C 637(a) for qualified 8(a) cont ractors.  Two or more additional contract awards are anticipated for large or small business contractors under Schedule A.   b. Schedule B shall consist of a 3-year base period of performance not expected to exceed $20,000,000.00 with 2 one-year optional periods not exceed $12,000,000.00 per year.  A $6,000,000.00  maximum ordering limit for Task Orders is anticipated with a $10 0,000.00 minimum order amount for Schedule B awards. Multiple awards are anticipated for Schedule B with two or more contract awards to be made under the authority of Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C 637(a) to qualified 8(a) contractors. An offeror may submit a proposal for either Schedule A or B or for both schedules.  Note that Schedule B is restricted to qualified 8(a) contractors.     3. METHOD OF SELECTION OF AWARDEES:  For  Schedules A and B described above, THE ALASKA DISTRICT CORPS OF ENGINEERS plans to select from 8(a), and large and small offerors (Schedule A only) using the best-value source selection method.  The planned factor s for selection of awardees include the following non-price factors, listed in descending order of importance for both the Construction and Design team members (to include credentials of proposed design team members):  Past performance, key personnel, expe rience.  Other factors to be considered are organization and management, and small-business subcontracting plan where applicable.  Price/cost shall be evaluated using proposed management personnel and key personnel hourly rates, direct overhead rate applic able to management and key personnel, labor burdens for tradesmen exclusive of those required by the applicable Davis-Bacon rates and General & Administrative overhead rate for the base period and each optional period. Costs will be evaluated for realism a nd affordability by comparing to the Independent Government Estimate and the costs of the other offerors.  When selecting an awardee for a contract under either schedule, the price/cost element of the proposal is planned to be less important than the combi ned non-price factors in determining the best value to the Government.  The offers that present the best value to the Government non-price factors and price/cost considered shall receive an award using the Best-Value Source Selection method.   5. COMPETITION OF TASK ORDERS:  For the IDIQ contract periods described herein and within the monetary limitations defined, awardees of the IDIQ contract shall have a fair opportunity to compete for Design-Build Construction or Construction task orders wit h the following exceptions: (1)	Competition for Task Orders over $3,000,000.00 may be limited to 8(a) firm  awardees in accordance with FAR 19.805-1; (2)	Task Orders may  also be negotiated and awarded for a negotiated fair and reasonable price on a sole-source basis to an IDIQ awardee under the following conditions:  a.	Requirements under $3,000,000.00 to 8(a) awardees;  b.	 Any requirement under the IDIQ maximum Task Order limit to an 8(a) awardee owned by an Indian tribe or an Alaska Native Corporation; c.	Competition among IDIQ awardees would result in an unacceptable delay in fulfilling an urgent requirement; d.	Unique or highly specialized services of a quality obtainable from a single IDIQ awardee;  e.	In the interest of economy and efficiency for a logical follow-on order already issued under the contract where awardees were  given a fair opportunity to  for the original order; f.	To satisfy the minimum guaranteed amount. Selection of an awardee submitting a proposal for a competitive Task Order is planned to be based on the following non-price factors and price.  The relative importance of factors as well as the relative importance of the non-price factors to price shall v ary with Task Orders.  a.	Past performance on other Task Orders; b.	Understanding of the Requirement; c.	Schedule; d.	Other predetermined factors considered important to successful completion of the instant Task Order. The best-value, low-price technically acceptable, or low-price selection methods may be used to select awardees for competitive Task Orders.   6.  EXERCISE OF OPTIONS:  Past performance on Task Orders shall be a factor in determining whether an additional period of services shall be awarded under this IDIQ.  Optional periods may be exercised early if contract capacity is exceeded before the term expiration; however, the term or life of the contract shall be decreased accordingly. Exercise of options are solely at the discretion of the Government. 7.
