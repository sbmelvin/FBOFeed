<CONTACT>Linda M. Butler, Contract Specialist, 540-727-8044, Fax: 540-727-8046
<DESC>This draft requirement was previously announced under CBD notice #5151W9, dated 12/14/01 and amended on notice #5156C5, dated 12/19/01. GovWorks will provide the contract support for this acquisition, and all questions will be sent to the Contracting Office by e-mail. Any vendor contacting the program office or any other related technical office for information may be disqualified from further participation. The purpose of this synopsis is to notify potential vendors that the draft specifications for this requirement have been finalized and are available for review and retention.   The solicitation for this effort will be announced in early FY03 with award of a contract scheduled for March 2003.  The program office is a joint services Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program established to develop a package of integrated instrumentation components for applications in tri-service (Air Force, Army, Navy) small missile test and training applications. Components developed will support telemetry, time-space-position-information (TSPI), flight termination, and end-game scoring.  The program will provide GPSA/IMU based Time Space Positioning Information (TSPI) for test range tracking and missile performance evaluation.  The program will provide the ability to track missiles and targets operating in areas without standard radar or other line-of-site tracking instrumentation by relying on the relay at the telemetry information to a ground station.  The Program will provide TSPI, missile/weapon atltitude and vector scoring for range safety applications. The components consist of airborne and ground elements. The high dynamic TSPI Unit  (JTU) is the airborne component, and the purpose of this acquisition. It will provide GPS and IMU measurements that can be processed on the ground for tracking of missiles and targets and missile test and evaluation requirements. The JTU consists of 5 primary components: (1) GPS Sensor.  An integral GPS sensor accepts external RF antenna input which may or may not (depending upon the platform) be conditioned by an external filter/limiter/amplifier. The GPS sensor can monitor and time tag three JTU-buffered, external event discrete items for incorporation into its outer data stream. (2) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Signals from internal triaxially-mounted accelerometers and rate sensors are combined with burst-mode CPS/Event data and formatted for output by an internal processor. (3) Data Acquisition System. The JTU outputs a data stream formatted for telemetry transmission via the serial port. This data is sent to the external missile telemetry system for transmission to the TSPI Ground Unit. The protocol of the TSPI Unit Message Structure (TUMS) is defined in the JTU Data Protocol Document. (4) Digital Interface Formatter (processor). The internal processor acts as an internal communications controller hub. The processor formats GPS serial port programming data before forwarding it to the GPS sensor. The processor merges GPS/Event data with IMU data, monitors the mode selection inputs, and converts the output data to the selected format (RS-232, RS-422, or parallel) for inclusion in the data stream. (5) Associated Power System. The JTU filters external power and feeds internal DC/DC converters. The contractor shall design, develop, fabricate, test and deliver the JTU in accordance with the solicitation. A Draft JTU-High Dynamic specification is available upon request from the Contracting Office listed in this notice. All electrical and mechanical characteristics of this JTU shall conform to documentation provided by the Government. The contractor shall deliver 20 each high dynamic JTU's and (if split into airborne and ground segments), 6 each ground units, with additional options for 150 JTU-high dynamic units, 50 ground units, and Built-In Test for JTU. This precise quantity is subject to change prior to release of the final solicitation. Pre-delivery testing shall be conducted by the contractor with Eglin Air Force Base, FL, for initial Government testing. The Government shall support the Final Acceptance Testing in accordance with a Test Plan developed by the contractor and approved by the Government. Award will be based on a Commercial Item (FAR Part 12, and 13.5) Best Value, firm-fixed-price contract, with a 14-month period of performance. The NAICS code for this requirement is 336419 (100 employees), but this is not a set-aside acquisition. Evaluation will consist of Technical, Risk, Schedule, Past Performance (from the past 2 years with similar effort), and Price. Of the 5 basic evaluation factors, Technical is most important, with the other 4 factors relatively equal in importance. All factors combined are significantly more important than Price. The importance of Price as an evaluation factor will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals. Please let the Government know by Thursday, August 22, 2002, if you plan to attend the discussion session to be conducted during the Hardened Subminiature Telemetry Sensors & Systems (HSTSS)/Joint Advanced Missile Instrumentation (JAMI) Symposium in Denver, CO, August 27 - 29, 2002.  The specifics of registration for the symposium and the exact time of discussions for this acquisition will be provided to those who request a copy of the specification. You may request a copy of the Revised Draft SpecificationFinal Specifications by e-mail from Linda M. Butler, Contract Specialist, GovWorks, 540-727-8044. By requesting the draft specifications, you will automatically receive a copy of the solicitation when later released. GovWorks is a Federal Franchise Procurement Office within the Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA 20170-4817, providing contract support to all agencies of the Federal Government on a service-for-fee basis.

<CONTACT>Frank Damiano, Commercialization Manager, Phone 865-576-2967, Fax 865-241-6096, Email damianofv@ornl.gov
<DESC>UT-Battelle, LLC, managing contractor for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) under U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Contract Number DE-AC05-00OR22725, is seeking to negotiate a "Work-for-Others" agreement with interested parties for the private sector-funded extraction of up to 50 millicuries (mCi) of thorium-229 (Th-229) from uranium-233 (U-233), using existing facilities, procedures, and personnel at the ORNL.  This activity would increase the existing stockpile of Th-229 in support of DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology's efforts to increase the availability of Actinium 225 (Ac-225) for medical research and treatment.  The Th-229 extraction must be performed in the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2002.  The estimated cost for the extraction of up to 50 mCi of Th-229 is $700,000. UT-Battelle will consider one or more agreements for the separation of a maximum of 50 mCi of Th-229 in fiscal year 2003. Muliple agreements will be determined based upon the quantity (mCi) of thorium extraction being funded by the Sponsor(s).

The selected party(s) will be granted first access at market price to the Ac-225 processed from the additional Th-229 for a period of five (5) years.  Extraction of Ac-225 from Th-229 will continue to be performed by ORNL and title to the Th-229 will remain with DOE.  Expression of interest should be received by September 13, 2002. No licensing intermediaries please. This is not a procurement activity.

The DOE has issued a Request for Proposals (RFP)(DE-RP05-00OR22860) entitled "U-233 Disposition, Medical Isotope Production, and Building 3019 Complex Shutdown" (U-233 Project) for the extraction of Th-229 and for the downblending and packaging of the entire inventory of U-233 now stored in Bldg. 3019 at the ORNL.  It is anticipated that a contract award resulting from the aforementioned RFP will be made in the Spring of 2003.  At that time, DOE will consider other avenues that would increase the supply of Th-229 for subsequent extraction of Ac-225 until such time that the U-233 Project is prepared to extract additional Th-229.

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development, Jordan mission (USAID/Jordan) seeks proposals from private consulting companies, agribusiness companies, non-governmental organizations (USNGOs), PVOs and U.S. universities that have experience in agricultural water-use efficiency, a strong extension program and experience with agricultural social marketing communications and community mobilization techniques, or consortia comprised of the foregoing.  The purpose is to design and implement a water use efficiency program for Jordanian farmers. Responses should demonstrate that offerors have U.S. nationality, preferably internationally, recognized and documented records of success in developing water-efficient, high value agriculture in desert environments at the farm level.  Proposals must demonstrate that offerors are capable of implementing a strong social marketing communication methodology in their extension services to improve farmers' practices.  Furthermore, they are requested to demonstrate that they will be capable of developing a sustainable private sector, NGOs or university-based strong agricultural water-use efficiency extension with agricultural marketing/communication capabilities in up to three entities including Jordanian universities and/or Jordanian NGOs/cooperative and/or the private sector.  The Contractor will be responsible for managing the program and achieving a specific set of objectives.  The contractor will work with several local partners especially farmers association and cooperatives, the private sector, non-governmental organization, universities, community-based groups, research and extension systems and communication personnel.  The contractor will collaborate with other projects funded by different donors, working in the irrigated agriculture area.  The contractor will work with the private and public sectors to encourage farmers to increase their water use efficiency, switch to high value, less water intensive, crops as well as establish a viable agricultural extension system based on a social marketing, multi-dimensional communications model in the country.  This newly established extension service must have the capacity to plan and implement high quality research-based social marketing extension programs on a sustainable basis in the future.  USAID estimates that the contractor will need up to 60 months to fully carry out this effort.  However, the contract will be divided into a three-year base contract with two one-year options subject to extension of the Strategic Objective beyond the year of 2004.  The exercise of the option years are subject to demonstrated success during the base contract period based on an evaluation of the work implemented by the contractor.  USAID's estimate for the full 60 months is in the range of $5 million to $10 million. One contractor will be awarded the entire project.  It is anticipated the contract will be awarded by December 23.  USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and women-owned small business concerns in this activity as the prime contractor or as subcontractors in accordance with Part 19 of the FAR.  USAID reserves the right to cancel the project with written notice to the firms responding to this announcement.  To show an interest and request a copy of the Request for Proposals, which will be ready on or about August 28 for distribution, please send an e-mail request to Zabd-rabu@usaid.gov.  We also request that you include an updated telephone number and a fax number or an e-mail addresses where you can be contacted.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to obtain technical assistance services in the area of agricultural and natural resource-based sectors.  The central roles of these sectors are combating hunger and poverty, and serving as an engine for sustainable market-led economic growth and prosperity. 
...............................................................................
USAID anticipates awarding five to six (5 - 6) indefinite quantity contracts (IQCs).  USAID anticipates awarding up to three to four (3-4) awards under full and open competition.  Also anticipated are up to one (1) small business set-aside award reserved for either a) a consortium led by a small business or b) a small business.  Finally, it is anticipated that there will be one (1) award set-aside for a consortium led by a small business or a small business which will have limited scope within the overall services to be provided under the RAISE PLUS IQC.  Specifically, the last award anticipated will be limited to providing services in design, evaluation, workshops and conferences....................................................................................

There is an expectation that many of the Task Orders submitted by USAID Missions under the IQCs will be very complex and demanding for any one firm to be able to provide all the required mix of skills.  Therefore, firms are encouraged to submit proposals in behalf of a consortium with one organization serving as the lead business.  Also encouraged are proposals from consortiums led by a small businesses..................................................................................................

There is an authorized sector ceiling of US$500 million for the RAISE PLUS activities over a five year period.  The aggregate ceiling will apply as follows;   US$480 million will serve as the aggregate ceiling for the four IQCs awarded to provide the full spectrum of services.  US$20 million will serve as the ceiling for the one small business award providing the aforementioned limited services.   The total amount for Task Orders issued under the resulting RAISE PLUS related IQCs may not exceed their respective ceilings...............................................................................................

Note: There is no guarantee on the number of contracts awarded, the number of Task Orders, or amount of business  that any one firm will receive beyond the minimum stated in the RFP.  
Also Note:  The FY 2002 Appropriations Act contains new authority that allows Task Orders to be awarded to small and small disadvantaged businesses (i.e., firms who have been awarded a contract) without providing a fair opportunity to all contractors under a multiple award IQC.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB) plans to procure BRCA1/BRCA2 GENE SEQUENCING services with Myriad Genetic Laboratories, Inc., 320 Wakara Way, Salt Lake City, Utah 84108.   The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.5.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB) is engaged in an ongoing clinical genetics study of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer. CGB has a need to obtain complete sequencing of the two-breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility genes known as BRCA1 and BRCA2 as part of this research project. In addition, the CGB has a need for mutation testing, which targets the three Ashkenazi founder BRCA mutations, and for single mutation testing in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 in selected individuals.  The samples were derived from individuals who are members of families in which these two cancers have occurred with unusual frequency. This study is part of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, intramural research program within DCEG=s Human Genetics Program, which is focused upon elucidation of the entire spectrum of scientific and clinical issues related to familial and hereditary forms of cancer.  The current acquisition represents an extension of prior work done for the Government by Myriad Genetics, under purchase order number 263MQ004385 through which CGB submitted 80 DNA samples to Myriad Genetics for germline BRCA1/2 mutation testing.  The CGB has decided to expand the scope of this project beyond that originally envisioned.  Period of Performance: Upon award of purchase order through twelve (12) months, with four (4) twelve (12) month option renewals if exercised; FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to extend service (November 1999) and FAR Clause 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (March 2000) applies to this order.  Approximately 40 samples are projected for analysis during each of these time periods. The requirement will be a fixed price order.  Myriad Genetic Laboratories, Inc. is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the above service.  It is essential to the ongoing scientific integrity and validity of the research studies being supported to obtain future data in a manner which will permit reliable comparison with assay results already obtained. In order to insure comparability of subsequent assay results with those already performed, the current procurement is proposed as a sole source acquisition.  Failure to do so could invalidate the cornerstone of these important research projects, i.e., the accurate, timely and reliable classification of study participants with regard to their BRCA1/2 germline mutation status. Myriad Genetics owns the patents on both the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes, and thus is the only commercial vendor available to perform the required work.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above supplies, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington D.C. time) on August 28, 2002.   If you have questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at  holdcram@excange.nih.gov or by fax at (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), through services provided by the HHS/Program Support Center intends to award an eight month, sole source, simplified acquisition to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP).  The AACAP is the only national professional association of child and adolescent psychiatrists.  Its membership (5,500) includes the leading researchers and represents both academicians and practitioners.  In 1991, the AACAP's Office of Research implemented a pilot project to recruit minority medical students and general psychiatry residents into careers in child and adolescent psychiatry research.  In 1992, the Academy implemented phase II of this project to immerse minority medical students in ongoing research projects with child and adolescent psychiatry investigators/mentors.  In 1993, the Academy secured an NIMH T35 Minority Recruitment Research Careers grant to support the James Comer Minority Research Fellowships for Medical Students.  The Comer Fellowships provided twelve outstanding medical students with early exposure to the state-of-the-art research in child and adolescent psychiatry.  From 1995 through 2001, AACAP, under contract from CMHS, developed a model for recruiting minority medical students into clinical careers in adolescent and child psychiatry.  In the model, AACAP solicits applications from minority medical students to participate in a summer program that emphasizes supervised clinical experience and culminates in presentation of their experiences in a poster session at the annual meeting of the AACAP.  Process evaluations and self-reports from the medical students indicate consistently high levels of achievement and enthusiasm for this program.  The outcomes of the 1995 and 1996 programs are: Of 10 participants, 8 were located for follow-up; 6 of these 8 chose psychiatry residencies, for a 75% success rate.  AACAP is uniquely qualified to produce technical assistance materials which can be used by all 50 States to further develop and evaluate the model for recruiting more ethnic minority medical students into child and adolescent psychiatry careers.  The objectives of this project are to: 1) heighten awareness of the opportunities in child and adolescent psychiatry; 2) increase hands-on experience; 3) increase awareness of child and adolescent psychiatry as a discipline; and 4) provide role models, mentors, and contacts for medical students of under represented minorities.  At this time, the Government knows of no other organization qualified to undertake this procurement.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  Award will be made utilizing simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b).  No solicitation is available for this requirement.  Interested concerns may submit a capability statement within 15 days after the publication date of this notice.  All timely responses will be considered, however, a determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon the responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses should be addressed to the attention of the Contracting Officer referencing number 02M009328.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), through services provided by the HHS/Program Support Center intends to award a 24 month, sole source, simplified acquisition to Generations United.  Generations United (GU) is the only national membership organization focused solely on promoting intergenerational strategies, programs and policies.  GU was founded in 1986 by the Child Welfare League of America, the National Council on the Aging, the Children's Defense Fund, and AARP and now includes over 100 national state, and local organizations representing more than 70 million Americans.  One of GU's key intergenerational initiatives is its National Center on Grandparents and Other Relatives Raising Children.  The Center provides training and technical assistance to direct service providers and other professionals working with these families and the issues affecting them.  With funding from CMHS, GU has been partnering with the Brookdale Foundation Group to replicate its local Relatives As Parent Program (RAPP) model in behavioral health facilities around the country.  GU is the only organization uniquely qualified to build on the work begun by GU and Brookdale to assist CMHS in addressing the unmet mental health needs of grandparents and other relatives who have taken on the responsibility of surrogate parenting of children with serious emotional disturbance.  This project will continue to expand the capacity in local communities to meet the mental health needs of grandparents and other relatives raising children through creation of support groups and other supportive mental health services in mental health centers.  This project will enable local behavioral health agencies to provide accessible support groups and other supportive services not currently provided.  The objectives of this project are to: 1) encourage cooperation and collaboration among various service delivery systems (i.e. child care providers, substance abuse treatment centers, aging services, family services, educational systems, mental health services, legal services, and primary health care centers); 2) ensure the development, expansion and future continuity of local services to grandparent and other relative headed families; and 3) create replicable model supportive mental health services.  Specifically, GU shall provide training and technical assistance to at least three behavioral health model programs in community-based mental health organizations in three different states, including at least one organization that is providing model services for adolescents being raised by their relatives.  Technical assistance shall be provided through site visits.  At this time, the Government knows of no other organization qualified to undertake this procurement.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  Award will be made utilizing simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b).  No solicitation is available for this requirement.  Interested concerns may submit a capability statement within 15 days after the publication date of this notice.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Fluorescence Imaging Facility (FIF) plans to procure from Universal Imaging Corpation, 402 Boot Rd, Downingtown, PA  19335 the upgrade of their Government owned Universal Imaging MetaMorph Image Acquisition and analysis workstation to facilitate rapid time-lapse imaging.  By incorporating a CARV confocal system with Nipkow scanning disk with multiple pinholes, a cooled CCD camera and mercury lamp light to its existing system.  The Fluorescence Imaging Facility does time lapse imaging of living samples, which requires rapid imaging in conditions non-damaging for living cells.  This requires an instrument capable of rapid image acquisition at relatively low level of irradiation and the ability to switch between confocal and non-confocal mode of acquisition, with excitation/emission capabilities that are easily adaptable to the rapidly expanding selection of fluorescent tags for living cells.  The system includes a XY controllable stage which allows point visiting and simultaneous collection of time lapse images of several cells during a single experiment and a piezofocus device to allow one to rapidly change the focus and collect an image of a whole cell as a set of focal planes at each time point.  These devices will allow FIF to image living cells faster and to image more cells in a single experiment.  The CARV is the only confocal microscope which uses a standard microscope HBO 100 W as an illumination source which allows fluorescence excitation between 360 nm and 900 nm and by changing filters the system is adaptable to any new fluorescence label.  This system is being integrated into FIF existing system and it is important that none of the existing warranties of this system be voided when this system is upgraded.  This equipment is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI research to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 3:00 p.m. EDT, on August 19, 2002.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor?s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.   NAICS 334516

<DESC>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to negotiate with SANAD Support Technologies, which is located at 11820 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, MD 20852 Colesville Road, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910, on a sole-source basis to add two new line items to the current contract number N01-LM-9-3528.  The current fixed price, indefinite delivery (indefinite quantity) type contract is for the preparation of library materials for binding as a means of preservation. The current contract contains line items for specific tasks.  One of these tasks is for the processing of serial units. As part of this task the contractor must first identify the  missing serial issues from the NLM collection; however, not every serial unit contains missing serial issues.  It is necessary to add a specific line item and price to the contract to reflect this discrete task of processing missing serial issues as it differs from the larger task of processing serial units.  The incomplete serial sets entail a different amount of effort than the complete serial units and should be charged at a different unit price from the incomplete serial units.   In addition, a line item allowing for photocopying of high gloss covers of serial issues is also being added as a new line item to the contract during each of the two option years  remaining under the current contract.  The reason for this is because many medical journals are published with very glossy covers that are problematic for the double-fan adhesive binding process, since the glue does not adhere well to the glossy covers.  Therefore, it is sometimes necessary for the binding preparation contractor to remove, photocopy, and place the photocopied glossy covers correctly in the serial unit before shipping the serial units to the binder, and this specific task requires additional effort.  The work under this contract is performed onsite at NLM.  SANAD's staff have the extensive training in collation, book handling, and the maintenance of NLM's data files required to perform the current statement of work.    The unique capabilities and experience of the current contractor, inherent duplication of cost and effort to the government, logistical constraints on site, and delays in preparation which would impact the related contractor for microfilming make competition for this effort unfeasible.  This notice of intent is not a Request For Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available.   Based on authority cited in 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)), award to SANAD Support Technologies for this contract without full and open competition is planned. (See numbered notes 22 and 26.)

<DESC>The Broadcasting Board of Governors/ International Broadcasting Bureau (BBG/IBB), Office of Contracts, (M/CON/CR) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, using commercial contracting procedures, with The Egyptian Satellite Company, Nilesat, P.O. Box 72, 6th of October City, Egypt.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition applicable to this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), Only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Agency requirement.  Nilesat is currently providing a stereo audio service under an existing purchase order.  BBG must expand its transmissions in order to reach a larger audience.  To meet this requirement, BBG must consolidate the existing Nilesat effort with work for the Middle East Radio Network (MERN).  Consequently, additional channels are required to expand the stereo audio service before September 1, 2002.  BBG also requires four (4) additional satellite audio channels (four stereo pair) and an option for a video channel for MERN.  These additional channels will enable MERN to broadcast into the Middle East region 24 hours per day, seven (7) days per week on a widely received satellite system.  The Government has determined that MERN is best supported by the continued use of Nilesat as this enables BBG to achieve expanded coverage and facilitate MERN.  The performance term is through March 15, 2003 with six (6) consecutive yearly renewal options.  This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Those interested may submit documentation of their capability to perform to this requirement. The Government must receive all written forms of expression by 3:00 PM E.S.T., on Monday, August 26, 2002.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Any information received from interested firms who respond to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Amendment 02:  The purpose of this amendment is to delete the following statement from the original synopsis dated 08/09/02: In addition to the terms set forth elsewhere in the contract, the contractor may earn an extension or reduction to the contract period from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 5 years on the basis of performance during the evaluation periods. The contractor is evaluated during the first year of performance, but extensions or reductions start in the second year. If scores are very good during Year 2, the contractor earns Year 4; if scores are very good in Year 3, the contractor earns Year 5. In Year 5, the contractor must earn a score of excellent in order for the contract period to be extended beyond Year 5. Consistent scores of excellent during succeeding years earn contract period extensions up to a maximum of 10 years. The contract period may also be reduced on the basis of the contractor's performance against the stated performance parameters. Points are awarded or deducted during each year of the contract on the basis of how the contractor has performed against the predetermined criteria. The contract period is then extended or reduced to reflect this assessment. The primary point of contact may be reached at email address ihall@comdt.uscg.mil.  The alternate may be reached at jhensley@comdt.uscg.mil

<ARCHDATE>08132003
<CONTACT>Wayne Leong Contracting Officer 2023665620     wayne.leong@marad.dot.gov;
<DESC>This is a follow-on announcement to a synopsis that MARAD issued on June 28, 2002.  That synopsis announced the start of an A-76 cost-comparison study to manage and operate its three National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF) sites: Suisun Bay near Benicia, Calif., James River near Ft. Eustis, Va; and the Neches River, near Beaumont, Texas.  Combined, these sites comprise some 240 inactive merchant and Navy ships.   MARAD had begun market research of industry capabilities and interest and development of a performance work statement (PWS)-. The A-76 study will review the operations at the NDRF sites to determine the least costly and most efficient method of operation.  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, "Performance of Commercial Activities", sets forth the general policy of the Government to achieve economy and enhance productivity.  The circular requires Federal agencies to review their commercial activities to determine whether it would be more economical to continue operating them in-house (i.e., with Government employees) or under contract with commercial sources.  The review will be conducted in accordance with Circular A-76 and the revised supplemental handbook.   The June synopsis also announced that subsequent synopses would be issued to post drafts of the PWS.  This synopsis serves to publish the first draft of the PWS.  Comments of a general nature on the PWS are welcome.  Comments received before September 5 will be considered.  Two important notes to consider: First, the fleet manual referenced in the PWS is being revised and it, along with workload data, will be completed at a later time.  It is expected that these, together with a refined PWS, will be published in mid September for public comment.  Secondly, although this draft PWS states that custodial and grounds maintenance services will be Government-furnished; MARAD is revising the PWS to include such work.  The refined PWS will reflect the changed requirement to perform custodial and grounds maintenance at each of the sites.  Submit any comments to acquisitions.marad@marad.dot.gov.

<DESC>CONVERT DIESEL BUS TO COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS (CNG). 1) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.

6)  DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:  
i)  The contractor shall prove all labor, equipment, transportation, materials, tools, parts, and supplies (unless otherwise stated) required to convert a diesel bus to a dedicated compressed natural gas (CNG) fueled vehicle.  The bus will be supplied by 3 TRANS/LGTM from their existing fleet.

iv)  The conversion requires replacing the existing diesel engine (Cummins ISB 190) with a Cummins 5.9G-230 dedicated CNG engine or equal.

The short-listed firms will develop Stage II technical proposal and pricing.  The technical package evaluation factors are:		(1)	Experience and Past Performance of Specialty Subs (45 points);	(2)	Remaining Team Composition (25 points);	(3)	Management and Technical Approach (20 points); and,	(4)	Sustainable Design Plan (10 points) for a total of 100 points.  Stage II includes the evaluation of price; however, the price factor is not initially as important as the technical factors.  Stage I technical points will be added to Stage II technical points for a cumulative total evaluation score.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price then becomes more important.  These firms will be invited to respond to the Stage II solicitation/request for proposal upon its issuance on or about October 1, 2002.  Points of Contract (POC?s) for this project are Georgann Butler, Contracting Officer (816-823-4918) and Denise Ryerkerk, Project Manager (816-823-2269).

<SOLNBR>M6740002T0838
<RESPDATE>081902
<CONTACT>Major Steve Schmid schmidsj@mcbbutler.usmc.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received from contractors: Q.  Are the lockers to be steel? solid plastic? wood? A.  All materials will be considered in the technically acceptable determination.  However, they must be warranted for a minimum of 10 years against rust and other types of corrosion, termite damage, delamination, or breakage.  Okinawa is an extremely humid environment and Marines are the toughest of customers.  Metal would have a hard time living up to these standards.  The lockers being replaced are wood and have suffered severe termite damage. Q.  The lockers are shown 20" deep on the drawings and 18" deep in the solicitation.   A.  The dimensions of the lockers requested are an industry standard size and are the size we are looking for.  20" is the size of the space they will be placed in.   Q.  Please advise if the double tier locker s on this req #m674002t0838 are to have coat rods and shelves like the single tier lockers? A.  The double tier lockers do not require a shelf or a rod.  Coats hooks are optional. Q.  Must the shelf in the single tier locker be located 18" down from the top or can our standard 9" down from the top be acceptable? A.

<DESC>***This modification serves as notification that this project is no longer being set-aside for small business.  All other terms and conditions of the original FedBizOpps announcement remain the same.***  Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act, the Southwest Fisheries Science Center, of the National Marine Fisheries Service, is required to periodically assess the status of marine mammal populations in waters under U.S. jurisdiction.  Large-scale ship and aerial surveys have been conducted along the west coast, but information on cetaceans around the Hawaiian Islands remains sparse for most species.  In summer and fall of 2002, the SWFSC is planning a ship-based line-transect survey of cetaceans in the Hawaiian EEZ waters (from Hawaii to Midway and out 200 nmi).  However, that survey will be designed to cover a broad pelagic area and will not concentrate on insular stocks of cetaceans such as spinner dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, false killer whales, or spotted dolphins.  There is a need for additional studies to gather more information about these cetaceans which may be near to the Hawaiian Islands.  The information will be used in evaluating threats to populations, and will likely be used in policy decisions.  Therefore, the information in final report(s) must be of a quality equal to that found in scientific journals.  Collaboration with industry, both research organizations and commercial vessel owners, is desired. 

The Western Administrative Support Center seeks proposals in the following areas: estimating abundance of species; determining movement and residency patterns; determining local habitat usage and depth distributions; obtaining tissue samples for genetic analysis of population structure; obtaining identification photographs of uniquely marked individuals.  Up to $130,000 is available for one or more selected proposals.  The period of performance will be from award, expected in late September, through August 2003.

<ARCHDATE>11112002
<CONTACT>Kathleen Wilder, (508) 233-4124
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command is conducting a market survey of man-portable, flame/incendiary weapons for use in close combat in urban and complex (mountains, jungle, forest) terrain by dismounted soldiers.  While we  seek to determine what weapons are commercially available today, we are also interested in new or emerging technologies that could potentially increase the capabilities of existing flame/incendiary weapons, or could result in a novel weapon.  The technolo gies (current or future) can relate to new or different methods for payload delivery, the weapon's materiel composition, improvements in the incendiary/flame components, or adding a flame capabity to a weapon that currently does not have one.  The consider ation of any technology is not constrained by current U.S. doctrine, with the exception of violation of current human use policy or treaties. Depending on the results of this survey, there may be a follow-on demonstration (live and/or virtual) of these tec hnologies to key military personnel, but there is no guarantee of such an event. All interested parties should respond to this market survey within 30 days of publication of this notice. Responses should consist of agency/organization name, address, point of contact, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, and information about the weapons/technologies.  The information (not to exceed two pages) must address: the weapon's technical attributes and its capabilities, its suitability for use in close comb at in urban or complex terrain, its portability, and, in the case of emerging technologies, a projected developmental timetable. Please also indicate willingness to participate in a possible demonstration with other companies at Ft. Benning, GA, in approxi mately six months at no expense to the government. The information can be mailed or e-mailed to the addresses provided below. This market survey does not constitute the solicitation of proposals, nor is there any obligation on the part of the government to  enter into any type of contractual arrangement with any of the entities for any of the candidate technologies, nor will the government pay for any information submitted.

<DESC>Research and development sources are sought for the Air Force Research Laboratory?s (AFRL?s) Directed Energy (DE) Directorate?s Satellite Assessment Center (SatAC).  SatAC is the Air Force-chartered organization that evaluates directed energy effects on space systems and performs assessments of space system susceptibilities to directed energy sources for the Department of Defense (reference DoD Instruction 3100.11) and develops tools to perform satellite and space systems technical analyses.  Space systems are defined to include satellites, missiles (tactical and ballistic), and the respective supporting architectures.   To support this objective, SatAC is interested in augmenting their technical and engineering expertise in the following major areas, to be performed on-site at the Air Force Research Laboratory,  Kirtland AFB, NM, and at contractors' facilities, and at third-party facilities:  (A) Gathering / Analyzing / Modeling Information; (B) System Assessments; (C) Computer Science Support.  Descriptions of each of these major areas follows:  (A) Gathering / Analyzing / Modeling Information includes obtaining, analyzing, and utilizing information in order to develop detailed system structural and functional models.  (B) Space system assessments are physics-based and include interactions with space weather, laser, radio frequency, high-power microwave, and other directed energy mechanisms from ground, air, space, or other emission sources.  Assessments include vulnerability analysis, astrodynamics, and other relevant aspects of system-level analyses.  (C) Computer Science Support encompasses development and use of software and databases to support system modeling, system assessment, assessment methodology automation, smart data fusion techniques and methods as applied to:   Space Situational Awareness (SSA), databases (multi-tier and relational), artificial intelligence, and automated tools/graphical user interfaces (GUIs) delivered to operational DoD customers.  A primary objective of the overall effort is the integration of all these areas to support SATAC research programs such as Space Situational Awareness (SSA) in support of DoD information dominance requirements for space. A read-file is available for review by contacting Capt. Lance Hrivnak, at (505) 846-3342, for an appointment.  An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ), cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) completion, term form, type contract is contemplated with a task-ordering period of 7 years.  The anticipated maximum ordering value is $49M.  Small businesses having the capability to perform this work are invited to submit a statement of capability (SOC) in order for the Government to determine whether the acquisition should be set aside for small businesses.  Based on the results of the SOC evaluation, the Government reserves the right to set aside this requirement for small businesses.  Offerors shall indicate whether they are/are not a small business, a small disadvantaged business, 8(a), hub-zone certified, woman-owned, or Historically Black College or University.  The SOC shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing the following areas:  (1)  Expertise in state-of-the-art satellite design (ISR, communication, navigation, and weather).  (2) Independent research and development programs conducted within the last three years in the technical areas being solicited and a description of significant results of such projects.  (3) Experience with the international space industry.  (4)  Demonstration of ability to conduct experiments in laboratory and field environments and a description of other areas of experience in the performance of experiments.  (5)  Demonstration of knowledge and understanding of all aspects of the physics, engineering, operation, and function of DoD imaging sensors, such as the AFRL Starfire Optical Range, and the exploitation of their respective data types.  (6) Experience with industry standard software codes and tools (for example, C++, FORTRAN, html/xml, ORACLE)  (7) Experience working with and interacting within the DOD space control and intelligence communities  (8) Experience and ability managing research resources to ensure that technical efforts are completed on schedule, within cost, and capable of supporting sporadic, quick turnaround efforts, and surge capability in support of short-notice, multi-million dollar projects.  (9) Demonstration of ability to develop new technical expertise in response to new space control assessment mission areas. Interested small businesses are requested to submit a statement of capability (original plus 2 copies) within 15 calendar days of this announcement, substantiating each qualification described in (1) through (9) above for RFP F29601-02-R-0006 to Det 8 AFRL/PKDL, Attn:  Maggie Howe, 2251 Maxwell Avenue SE, Kirtland AFB NM, 87117-5773.  Any responses received not addressing all of the above requirements will be rejected.  The capability statements shall be limited to 18 pages, not to exceed two pages per area, single spaced, 12-point font, Times New Roman, excluding resumes.  Regarding resumes, name, professional qualifications and specific experience of personnel who may be assigned as Program Manager may be included that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.  If required, to communicate contractor capabilities, TOP SECRET information will be accepted.  Please contact Capt. Lance Hrivnak, at (505) 846-3342, to arrange for delivery of any classified material.  However, whenever possible, submitted information will be unclassified.  Offerors should be aware that the majority of resources must be employed within a Top Secret environment.  A statement must be addressed by prospective offerors as to the ability to obtain, within 30 days of contract award, an industrial security clearance, the personnel and available storage facilities to support work at the Top Secret level.  Potential offerors responding to this sources sought synopsis must indicate whether they qualify as a small business under NAICS Code 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  An organizational conflict of interest clause is anticipated in any resultant contract.  Reference AFMC FAR Clause 5352.209-9002, ?Organizational Conflict of Interest? (Jul 1997).  This is not a Request For Proposals (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Any costs incurred as a result of this announcement shall be borne by the offeror and will not be charged to the Government for reimbursement. If your interest is in subcontracting possibilities, please indicate this clearly in your submission.  All respondents desiring a copy of future solicitations must provide a point of contact, complete mailing address, telephone and fax number, and email address.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to mediate concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the pre-proposal phase of competitive, negotiated acquisitions.  The Ombudsman does not participate in proposal evaluation or contractor selection. The Ombudsman can work with responsible acquisition officials to respond to concerns, but will not detract from the authorities of the Project Manager or Contracting Officer.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain the confidentiality of sources.  The Ombudsman at Phillips Research Site is Mr. Eugene C. DeWall, Director of Contracting, Det 8 AFRL/PK, 2251 Maxwell Ave SE, Kirtland AFB, NM, 87117-5773; (505) 846-4979.  Before contacting the Ombudsman, potential offerors should first refer contracting concerns to the Contracting Officer, David Castillo at (505) 853-3306, or refer technical concerns to the Project Manager, Capt Lance Hrivnak at (505) 846-3342.  It is anticipated that contractors will have access to or will generate data that is unclassified with limited distribution and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws.  Therefore, only offerors who are certified by the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) may submit offers.  Contact US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS, Federal Center, 74 Washington Ave, North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084, (800) 352-3572, http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ , for further information on certification and the approval process.  Offerors are required to either submit a copy of the DLIS approved DD Form 2345 with their proposal or to the Contracting Officer if access to unclassified, limited distribution data is required to prepare the proposal.  Foreign owned firms are not permitted to participate in this procurement.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<SUBJECT>R -- Notice of Intent to Award a follow-on Modification to Contract with Abt Associates
<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission to Guatemala/Central American Programs (G-CAP) proposes to modify existing contract 520-C-00-00-00035-00 with Abt Associates Inc.(Abt), under the Mission's Increased Rural Household Income and Food Security Strategic Objective (SO4). The Mission requirement is a 11 month extension of the Abt contract without a change in the Scope of Work, the total estimated cost will be increased over $250,000.  The primary effort under the Mission's (SO4) is currently being carried out under above mentioned contract which was awarded under full and open competition on 2/3/2000 for $6,821,921 and a three-year period.

The requirement was not anticipated at the time of the original award.  After the contract was awarded, the overall bilateral strategy for Guatemala was extended to September 30, 2004.  This extension will allow FY04 to serve as a transition between the old and new strategy periods.

Abt Associates has been providing highly specialized services in the areas of (1) private agricultural technology transfer systems, (2) 2nd. tier micro credit systems, (3) subgrant administration, and (4) Performance monitoring systems. In each of these diverse and highly specialized areas, Abt Associates has provided key experts that have achieved significant and impressive results.  Issuing a new instrument during FY03 for such a small time period is not practical because of the additional costs and time required to get a new mechanism established and fully functioning for a relatively short-term, and also because current implementation momentum would be disrupted.  The Mission intends to have in place a new acquisition and/or assistance instrument to implement activities for the new FY04-08 strategy period by early to mid FY04.

This modification to contract 520-C-00-00-00035-00 is being proposed under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5) for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the government or unacceptable delays.

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement within 15 days of publication of this notice.  In accordance with FAR 5.207(d)(xv), all responsible sources may submit to the Point of Contact a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  However, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action is solely within the discretion of the Government. This is a sole source requirement and we will proceed with the award on that basis.  No solicitation is available.

Title:  	Sub-15-femtosecond Active Synchronization Of Two Passively Mode-locked Ti: Sapphire Oscillators      

Description:  	The invention is able to control the relative timing jitter between pulse trains from two independent mode-locked femtosecond lasers to an unprecedented precision using three interleaved phase locked loops.  The key technology is the implementation of phase locked loops with successively higher timing resolutions to effectively minimize the timing jitter while preserving the full-scan dynamic range.  The timing jitter noise is below 15 femtoseconds, when observed with 1 kHz bandwidth over a period longer than one minute.  This is comparable to the pulse duration generated from the state-of-art ultrashort pulse lasers.  Control of timing offset between the two pulses, i.e. relatively tuning of one pulse train with respect to the other, is accomplished by all-electronic means, leading to a high degree of stability and repeatability compared to mechanical based systems.  The technology can be applied to any mode-locked lasers, even with different repetition rates.

<SUBJECT>D -- Increase in Ceiling on Multiple Award IDIQ Contract for 1-800 Medicare Call Center Services
<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to increase the ceiling on AdminaStar Federal's IDIQ contract number 500-97-0408. This contract is for 1-800 call center support. The primary function of this contract is to pilot, evaluate and implement approaches to respond to beneficiary telephone inquiries regarding Medicare, Medicaid and other CMS programs. The contract is for a base year with four (4) one-year options. It is currently in the fifth year of the potential five (5) year period of performance. The existing contract ceiling is $170 million.  CMS intends to increase the ceilings by  $45 million to accommodate an orderly transition to a successor contractor under a new competition.  CMS has awarded another set of multiple award IDIQ contracts for its Telephone Customer Service Strategy.    These contracts include an expanded role in the support of CMS's call center and customer service environment. The new IDIQs will consume one of the larger efforts under AdminaStar's existing IDIQ contract (i.e., the operation of the 1-800 Medicare Help Line). Until such time as the new task order for the 1-800 Medicare Help Line can be awarded and a replacement call center can be fully implemented, it has become necessary to increase the ceiling on AdminaStar's existing contract to accommodate another year of operations.  Comments concerning CMS's intent should be forwarded to Debbie Lester, Contract Specialist, at dlester@cms.hhs.gov within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.

<SUBJECT>A -- Request For Information For Foward Based Radars (FBR)
<DESC>This announcement is a Request For Information (RFI) only; it is not a notice of solicitation or Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has identified a potential requirement for Forward Based Radars (FBRs) to provide tracking and discrimination.  Such radars must be capable of sea or land basing.  This Request For Information (RFI) is being issued to determine the capability of industry to provide a radar to meet this potential requirement.  No proprietary data should be submitted in response to this RFI; responses may form the basis for a future Request for Proposal to develop and build a FBR.  RFI submissions will be reviewed by non-government personnel.  The MDA Systems Engineer Directorate and a team from the Missile Defense National Team, comprised of personnel from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, TRW, Raytheon, and General Dynamics, as well as participating FFRDCs and SETAs will review RFI responses.  The Missile Defense National Team is currently supporting MDA?s System Engineering Directorate to design a layered Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this Request for Information.  Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this RFI.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of this review.      

All information contained in the RFI is preliminary as well as subject to modification and is no way binding on the Government.  Potential technical requirements, scenarios for exploring sensor laydown and system capacity issues, and threat missile parameters are in a SECRET/NOFORN addendum to this RFI.  These requirements are minimums and respondents may describe and provide rationale for systems with greater capabilities.  To establish the feasibility of FBRs, MDA developed a concept based on a mechanical ?dish? type radar with a phased array feed to provide very limited electronic scan.   Responses describing fully filled and sparsely filled (i.e., limited scan) phased array alternative approaches and other systems that provide the desired capabilities are of interest.  High risk or unproven technologies are not desirable for this application.  The system should be ready for test as early as September 2004.  Incremental improvements through 2008 may be considered; responses should provide information on evolution/upgrade.

Respondents should direct requests for the addendum, questions, and responses regarding this RFI to Lt Col Greg Juday, 703-697-5599.  Respondents need to verify their security clearance and facilities before receiving these scenarios and parameters via secure fax.  If secure fax is not available, arrangements may be made to physically pick up or mail the scenarios and parameters. Contact Mr. Art Tyson (primary), 703-697-9229 or Mr. Gene White (alternate), 703-697-8131 for security verification.  Respondent cage code number, home office location, and point of contact are required for verification.

Responses are due by September 04, 2002.  Responses shall be submitted in MS Office 2000 Word.  Provide one hard copy and an electronic version on 250 Meg ZIP Disk.  E-mail responses are not permitted.  Individual responses shall be properly marked, be no more than 20 pages, and should address the following:

1)	Basic description, including:
o	Mechanical/electrical configuration
o	Legacy hardware (if any)
o	Software functionality and SLOC estimate
o	Legacy software (if any)
o	Weight estimate
o	Mechanical slew rates and accelerations (in all applicable axes)
o	Blake chart type sensitivity calculation using the parameters specified in the classified addendum.

2)	Discussion of FBR system (or system capability growth) concept for handling ballistic missile raids.  Provide this discussion in the context of the scenarios described in the classified addendum.  Assume the offense knows the location and mechanical and electronic scan limits of all FBRs, and structures their attack so as to provide maximum stress to the tracking and discrimination system.

3)	ROM cost for development plus first system (radar, installation in facility or ship, integration and test, but excluding facility or ship costs) and ROM cost for total system to address raids of various sizes for the scenario outlined in the classified addendum.

4)	FBR unit cost is expected to increase with both sensitivity and electronic scan making the trade among electronic scan, sensitivity and cost particularly critical.  Respondents should discuss why they believe their described approach to the affordability-sensitivity-electronic scan trade represents the best choice for a capability-based Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).

5)	Discuss facility and ship requirements for land and sea basing (general concept, ROM cost, size, weight, power, etc.).

6)	Discuss operations and maintenance crew requirements for 24x7 operation.

7)	For sea-based systems, describe the beam stabilization approach and estimate the maximum operating sea state (for each platform considered, if applicable).  At this worst operating condition, how much of the available electronic scan is dedicated to residual stabilization?

<SUBJECT>--Notice of Intent to Privatize the Natural Gas Distribution utility system at Anniston Army Depot, AL
<DESC>NA The Commander, Anniston Army Depot, acting through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District, 109 St. Joseph Street, Mobile, Alabama 36602-0001, is proposing to privatize the Natural Gas Distribution utility system at Anniston Army Depot, and to re ceive Requests for Proposals from all interested parties. The privatization will result in the transfer of ownership of the distribution system only, and will not establish a supply contract for the purchase of natural gas to the Depot.  The distribution s ystem consists of 1,518,637.56 linear feet of steel underground pipeline, ranging from 1-inch to 6-inch in diameter, 223,377.13 linear feet of plastic underground pipeline, ranging from 3/4-inch to 4-inch in diameter, and 767,416.00 linear feet of HDPE. Th e system includes 22 meters. The main into Anniston Army Depot from the main metering station in DeSoto Manor is directly connected to the Alabama Gas Corporation steel pipeline system and is protected by the ALAGASCO cathodic protection system. The cathod ic protection system is sufficient to protect the depot system. The medium pressure plastic gas pipe serving the various depot buildings Anodeless steel risers are used at the ends of the underground plastic pipe to go above the ground surface for connecti on of regulators, meters and building entrance steel piping. The Anodeless steel pipe is enclosed in plastic and connects through an adapter to the plastic pipe.  The distribution system was installed by the Department of the Army around 1990, and is consi dered to be in good condition at current, with no major renovations planned or needed.

<SUBJECT>--New Generation Army Target System (NGATS) Industry Day II Forum
<DESC>NA GENERAL:  The Army Targets Management Office, will host a SECOND Industry Day Forum on Tuesday, August 27, 2002, at Huntsville, AL.  The purpose of the forum is to provide interested parties and potential offerors information and an opportunity to provide feedback o n the proposed NGATS performance requirements, program plans, and solicitations.  Specifically, this second forum will focus on presenting the Army's Program Requirements Guidance Document (PRGD).  All firms who produce target hardware, battlefield effects  simulator, target control systems, target scoring systems, live fire ranges, or have experience in integration test and installation of similar distributed component systems are encouraged to attend this forum.  The Government has issued a Request for Inf ormation asking for comments and suggestions from interested industry on the PRGD and the document is available at ngats.redstone.army.mil. BACKGROUND:  The Army Targets Management Office intends to develop a New Generation Army Target System to replace existing target systems on live fire ranges.  This NGATS target system will be made up of families of targetry components that are interchangeable and prov ide the required performance at a low life cycle cost.  Compatible NGATS components will be deployed on Army training ranges in a sequential or blocked program where each block represents increases in performance, reductions in cost, or both. The NGATS pro gram is scheduled to begin fielding ranges in late FY06 with a Block I NGATS system.  The schedule for fielding Block II or subsequent blocks will be set at a later date. In order to implement Block I, the government has begun requirement definition and system design activities with a design integration contractor, CSC Inc of Huntsville, AL.  As a part of this design activity, the Government, along with the design integrati on contractor, will develop and provide system requirements and interfaces that target system components must meet.  The PRGD is the compilation of performance requirements that will serve as the source of information for specification development. During the remainder of FY02, FY03, and most of FY04, the Government intends to sponsor a series of Industry Days including the design integration contractor and interested target industry companies to present the progress of the design and interface defin itions.  Technical input from industry is strongly desired at these meetings.  Industry comment on the progress and direction of the government's activities will impact the content of the interfaces that NGATS Block I targetry components must meet.  The go vernment's intent is to have a family of each type of system component that will meet the interface requirements and provide a spectrum of price/performance to satisfy the large spectrum of Army range types and requirements. Beginning in late FY03 and continuing through FY04, the Government plans to operate a facility at the Redstone Arsenal where targetry component manufacturers can have their products tested for conformance to the requirements/interfaces. In late FY04, the g overnment will contract on a competitive basis, with a Production Integration Contractor to integrate and test a range system consisting of components that have been shown to meet the requirements/interfaces.  Following the successful tests/demonstrations of the prototype targetry system, the Production Integration Contractor will install targetry systems on Army live fire ranges.  Options for post warranty support of the installed ranges will be included in this contract for the use of range operators.  In stallation of NGATS Block I ranges is expected to continue for several years. NGATS Block II and any subsequent releases will be produced as a result of future procurement actions to introduce technology advancement and satisfy new training requirements.  Such releases will be integrated and tested by a competitively selected produc tion integration cont ractor who upon successful test/demonstration will be directed to install targetry systems on Army live fire ranges. The Production Integration contract will include a Hardware, Software and Services Exclusionary provision that will impose a restraint upon future business.  This is necessary to preclude potential conflicts of interest and prevent the existence of a confl icting interest that might bias the Production Integration Contractor's judgment.  Please see subpart 9.5, Federal Acquisition Regulation, 'Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest'. ADMISSION:  Reservations should be either faxed or e-mailed by 1700 hrs CST on Tuesday, August 20, 2002 to: 	Mr. Thomas H.
