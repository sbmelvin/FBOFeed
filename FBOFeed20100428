<DESC>FedBizOpps Synopsis for:
RECOVERY: OS CER:  ACADEMIC DETAILING

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is soliciting proposals on a Full and Open Basis, for an Academic Detailing Initiative, to be funded with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, (ARRA) funds.  This is a new requirement and there is no incumbent.  

           The solicitation and any documents relating to this requirement will be available by downloading from the internet through www.fedbizopps.gov.  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and to monitor this site for any subsequent amendments. It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued 15 days after the posting of this Synopsis.

The overall goal of the Academic Detailing initiative is to contract with an organization to conduct activities related to Academic Detailing so that selected target audiences put AHRQ’s comparative effectiveness products, tools, and research into practice.  Building relationships with clinician groups and organizations that can use comparative effectiveness reports to make decisions takes time and involves multiple visits and follow up through additional dissemination and marketing techniques.  The three year duration ensures that these relationships will be built in a way that not only encourages these groups and organizations to use the comparative effectiveness research products, but that also has them seek out these products once this contract ends.  The duration of the contract is also pivotal to the collection of meaningful metrics.  Having 3 years of data will allow AHRQ to understand the impact of the academic detailing process, the development of partnerships, and what types of outcomes AHRQ can expect during different phases of the project, and what detailing methods are most effective in fostering impact. The Contractor shall fully perform all of the tasks specified in the Statement of Work (SOW).  

This contract will be part of a 3-year project in which five complementary but separate contracts will be awarded. Four of the contracts are dissemination focused and have the specific goal of creating awareness of comparative effectiveness research and changing clinician behavior, and the fifth contract (the Evaluation Contractor) will evaluate the impact of those four contracts. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code that best describes the requirement is 541820.

The successful Contractor shall be aware of the other four contracts and collaborate with the other contractors when appropriate. For example, the Academic Detailing contractor is expected to keep the Continuing Education contractors and the Publicity Center informed of upcoming Academic Detailing activities that will be coming. Each contractor will be responsible for coordinating with the Evaluation Contractor to collect the metrics most suitable for this type of evaluation.  As much scientific rigor as possible is required for evaluation. To accurately evaluate the impact of AHRQ’s comparative effectiveness research, the contractor must remain a constant factor throughout the duration so as to not confound the results.

Under certain conditions, Section 1307 of the ESEA allows the Secretary to make arrangements with a public or private nonprofit agency to carry out the purposes of the MEP for the benefit of migrant children who reside in a State that is unable or unwilling to operate a MEP. Currently, two States (Connecticut (CT) and Rhode Island (RI)) have chosen to not operate a MEP. With the awarding of the Bypass contract, the OME is exercising its authority under section 1307 to establish a MEP that will identify, recruit, and serve the eligible migrant children who reside in the States of Connecticut and Rhode Island. If necessary, the OME reserves the option of adding additional States to this contract through a supplemental task order and supplemental funding.
<p>The Department requires contractor support to operate a MEP for the benefit of migrant children who reside in the States identified in this PWS (CT and RI) and any other State(s) identified in a subsequent task order(s). These States will be referred to as the "target States" in the remainder of this synopsis. During the base year of the contract, the contractor shall perform the following major tasks: (1) create and implement an effective program design plan and process to identify, recruit, and serve migrant children in the target States; (2) identify and recruit eligible migrant children in the target States; (3) develop a comprehensive needs assessment (CNA) for each target State's children; (4) electronically collect data on identified migrant children and report minimum data elements (MDE) to the Migrant Student Information Exchange (MSIX); and (5) provide supplemental support services for identified children, including but not limited to, ensuring the exchange of their academic and health information using MSIX.</p>
<p>During the first option year of the contract the contractor shall perform the following major tasks: (1) create and implement a service delivery plan (SDP) that addresses the needs identified in the CNA and are specific for each target State; (2) provide high-quality instructional and support services to migrant children as described in the target State's SDP; (3) perform a program evaluation and identify areas of improvement for each target State; and (4) conduct re-interviews of migrant parents and children for quality control. During the second, third and fourth option years, the contractor shall continue to operate a MEP for each target State, adhering to all requirements in this PWS, in Title I Part C of the statute, and in the MEP regulations (34 CFR) Part 200.81-200.89 and 34 CFR 200.100-103.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award this contract on the basis of best value using Full and Open Competition among public and private nonprofit agencies. It is anticipated that the resulting contract will be a fixed-price-award-fee (FPAF) contract awarded to a single provider with a one-year base period with three (3) one-year option periods. Proposals shall be required within 30 days of the issuance of the RFP. EMAIL INQUIRIES IN LIEU OF TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE ACCEPTED.

<a href="mailto:wilmari.delgado@emcbc.doe.gov">Wilmari C Delgado, Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>On May 14, 2010, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), EnvironmentalManagementConsolidated Business Center is planning to issue a solicitation for aNickelSales Agreement.  The solicitation will include approximately 15,300 tonsofclassified and contaminated nickel scrap, including approximately 5,600tons ofshredded nickel scrap currently stored at the East Tennessee TechnologyPark(ETTP) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee and approximately 9,700 tons of nickelingotscurrently stored at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (GDP) in Paducah,Kentucky.  The proposed sale would be conducted in accordance with 41 CFR102-38, Sale of Personal Property, and 41 CFR 109, Subchapter H,Utilizationand Disposal of Hazardous Materials and Certain Categories of Properties.The buyer will be required to declassify and decontaminate the nickel scrapprior to gaining title.  All of the nickel is volumetrically contaminatedwithrelatively low levels of uranium and technetium, with trace quantities ofneptunium and plutonium.  In addition, all of the nickel is classified andmustbe managed and processed accordingly.  The title transfer and the sale willoccur only upon DOE certification of declassification and decontaminationofthe nickel and compliance with DOE property management requirements.  TheBuyerbears responsibility, and cost, for all aspects of nickel disposition anditssecondary waste and products.  The nickel will be transported, processed,and/or reused/recycled into products that will be used inradiologically-controlled applications.  This material is NOT intended forunrestricted release for recycling into commerce and no nickel dispositionactivities will be performed outside of the United States.Proposals are anticipated to be due July 28, 2010.  The solicitation willbeposted on the Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) at:http://www.pr.doe.gov  and the Nickel Disposition website athttp://www.emcbc.doe.gov/Nickel .Potential Offerors are encouraged to conduct a through review of thesolicitation and submit clarifying questions, if any, as early as possible,butno later than 14 calendar days after issuance of the solicitation, so thattheacquisition process can proceed in a timely manner.  Offerors may submitquestions using the following methods: by e-mail to the Contracting Officer(CO) at Nickel@emcbc.doe.gov , by using the link to this mailbox on theNickelDisposition website: http://www.emcbc.doe.gov/Nickel or through the SubmitQuestions feature on the IIPS website.  DOE asks that the processes statedabove be used rather than mailing letters and/or telephone calls.  Anyamendments issued, responses to questions (if required), and other officialcommunications from the CO will be posted on the IIPS and the NickelDisposition website.DOE will offer an opportunity for properly-cleared and pre-registeredProspective Offerors to receive a briefing on the classification issuesrelatedto the nickel.  The Oak Ridge Office Classification Officer will presentthestandard that must be met to render the nickel no longer classified as wellasclassification guidance applicable to the nickel inventory, e.g., specificsonthe safeguard and security requirements for the possession, transportation,storage, processing, and disposition.  This briefing will be at theconfidential restricted data and secret national security informationcategoryand level.  As such, a DOE L or Q-clearance is required to attend thebriefing.  The briefing will be held at DOE Oak Ridge Office, FederalOfficeBuilding, 200 Administration Road, Oak Ridge, TN 37831, tentatively on orafterJune 2, 2010.  Registration information for the briefing will be posted attheIIPS and the Nickel Disposition website.  Attendees must submit allrequiredinformation within 10 calendar days of the solicitation.  The exactlocationwill be provided to attendees. No questions relating to the solicitationwillbe discussed in this briefing. Only classification related questions willbeaddressed in this briefing.Prospective Offerors are responsible for checking the IIPS and the NickelDisposition website frequently for information, notices, and updatesregardingthis solicitation.THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUEDASA COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A SALES AGREEMENT.

<DESC>Construction of Log Debris Structures.  The Olympic National Forest intends to acquire by contract floodplain and river restoration work from approximately River Mile 12 to 13 along the main stem of the South Fork Skokomish River, adjacent to the Oxbow Campground area.  Access is from Forest Service Road Nos. 23 and 2300-220.  Contractor shall construct approximately 30 strategically placed log debris structures along the edges of the main channel, on the flood plain, and at tributary outlets.  Project includes reconstructing approximately 0.5 mile of an abandoned forest road to provide access for heavy equipment and maintenance vehicles from the Oxbow campground to the project site.

General staging area during instream construction will be in the old Oxbow campground area, which would be closed during the project.  Tracked excavators and bulldozers will be used to construct logjams and large wood complexes along stream channels, gravel bars, and floodplains.  Each of the log jams will be strategically located to accomplish specific restoration objectives.  Most of the logjams would be constructed along the edges of the current stream channel or on the floodplain.  The amount of wood per structure will depend on the structure type and location and will range from 40 to about 180 pieces of wood per structure.  All of the logjams will be designed and constructed to remain stable during large flood events.  A large portion of each structure will be buried below the streambed.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service intends to award a non-competitive Interim Contract with Four Seasons Environmental, Inc, 43 New Garver Road, Monroe, OH, 45050 for the period of 07/01/2010-12/31/2010, for maintenance and repair (O&M) of HVAC systems, building structures, and other systems required for the continuous operation of the Atlanta Tax Submissions Processing Center, 4800 Buford Hwy, Chamblee, GA. 

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The NAICS is 561210, and Small Business Size Standard is 35.5M annual receipts.

Preparation of the solicitation for a new long term contract for this service has begun, however the follow-on contract action is not yet ready to be awarded and the services required must be maintained without disruption. Continuity of the services is imperative for the reasons explained below and therefore, this bridge contract is issued for the period of 07/01/2010 through 12/31/2010 pending award of a new contract effective 01/01/2011.

The current O&M Contractor, Four Seasons Environmental, Inc has performed the O&M services for over five years at this location and has the expertise and experience to provide the necessary uninterrupted services. By awarding to another Contractor the Government runs the risk of having an IRS tax return processing center shutdown at the busiest time of the year, since a new contractor will require time to become familiar with the building systems, their operation, and maintenance.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or a solicitation of offers. No solicitation document is available. Interested parties may submit their interest and ability to meet IRS needs. However, responses received as a result of this notice of intent will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by IRS not to open this requirement to competition based upon any written responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of IRS. Responses are due by 05/12/2010, 2:00 PM EST. For information regarding this notice, contact Pellumbeshe Hoxhaj, Contract Specialist, via fax: 404-338-9231 or e-mail: pellumbeshe.hoxhaj@irs.gov by e-mail.

<DESC>N00164-10-R-JN88 - LIGHT DURABLE, RELIABLE, MAGAZINES FOR THE SCAR - FSG 10 - NAICS 332992Issue Date 28 April 2010 - Closing Date 11 May 2010 - Time 2:00 PM EDST
This solicitation is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/.  FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet.
The objective of this announcement is to release draft performance specification for the Lightweight, Durable, Reliable, Magazine for the MK16 and MK17 SCAR variants with the intent to elicit comment from industry and academia to help further shape the specifications before the release of the solicitation.  The closing date for receipt of comments on the LDRMags performance specification(s) is on May 11, 2010.
Failure to provide written feedback to the draft performance specifications will not preclude abstaining vendors from bidding on anticipated future solicitations for the Lightweight, Durable, and Reliable, Magazines (LDRMags) for SCAR MK16 "Light" and MK17 "Heavy" variants.  This announcement is part of the full and open-competition process, which encourages industry and academia to help shape Government specifications to match what is possible, affordable, and timely.  Failure to provide written feedback may result in a future Government performance specification over which the abstaining vendors have limited influence in the acquisition process, and may deprive abstaining vendors of potentially valuable direct interaction with contracting officials and acquisition planners.
The anticipated procurement concerns the acquisitions of the Government's intent to procure commercially available Lightweight, Durable, and Reliable, Magazines (LDRMags) for SCAR MK16 "Light" and MK17 "Heavy" variants.  The scope of this particular acquisition includes the provision of up to 100 products sample systems for evaluation (50 each for "Light" and/or 50 each for "Heavy").  The LDRMags will be used primarily by USSOCOM units as alternative magazines to the OEM products.  This endeavor will culminate in the award of one or two ID/IQ type contracts and the intended acquisition synopsis will be posted at a later date once responses to input regarding the draft performance specification are received and evaluated resulting from this synopsis. 
It should be noted that during the course of this acquisition program, the Government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Weapons System Technology Integration Center (WSTIAC), Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH), and other direct Government contractors as advisors to the Government participants.
This announcement does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award of a contract.  The U.S. Government is in no way liable for reimbursement of any companies in response to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.  Any information provided that is marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.  Your interest in this program is appreciated.
Questions should be directed to Mr. Nickolas Robbins, contract specialist, Code JXML NF, telephone 812-854-6698, email nickolas.robbins@navy.mil or Mr. Dave Armstrong, code JXNLL, telephone 812-854-5731, email david.armstrong@navy.mil.

Statement of Work
Period of Performance: Six Months from date of award. The bulk of activity will occur within the first three weeks with subsequent, individual follow-up refresher sessions.
Background: 
EPA's Office of Public Affairs (OPA) recognizes the importance of providing hands-on, in-depth media training to all its senior officials to ensure they are equipped with the skills needed to deliver EPA's message successfully in any setting involving the news media and the public. 
EPA senior officials have varying degrees of experience in handling the media as it operates today - TV, radio, newspapers, the web, blogs, webcasts, and congressional testimony. It is essential that EPA senior officials be accessible to the media, the public and Congress in order to carry out the Administration's commitment to open and transparent government. OPA expects that media training, whether one-on-one or in group, will help EPA convey important information to the American people in the most clear, friendly and straightforward manner possible; make clear, concise points about the work of their programs and the Agency; handle challenging questions about sensitive and potentially controversial issues of public importance; and, present themselves and, thereby, the Agency in the best light in public settings.
EPA has a number of room settings where training can occur.  EPA will make its Studio One broadcast facility and its staff available when needed as well as other rooms, as necessary.
Scope
OPA requires the services of a professional media training contractor with demonstrated experience and understanding of the media and training techniques and skills necessary to deliver compelling, fast-paced, and appropriate group and one-on-one training.  The contractor shall be capable of delivering critical, candid and constructive feedback specific to individuals, small groups and larger groups of senior EPA officials. Approximately 50 senior officials would participate in the initial group media training session and the same 50 would then be scheduled for one-on-one training sessions.
After the media training contractor conducts the large group session and individual one-on-one sessions, EPA senior officials will be able to:
Participate with confidence in interview situations for print, web, radio and televisionHandle live on set interviews and straight on camera readingsUnderstand how to develop a news hook and compelling "lead"Deliver messages that have impactKnow how to take control of an interviewBridge from reporters' questions to answers reflecting the Agency's missionAnswer tough questions firmlySpot and avoid trick questionsIdentify common pitfalls that doom interviewsLook great on television and in photosHave command over non-verbal communicationManage and handle a media crisisGive compelling Congressional Testimony
Tasks:
1. Conduct two large group media training presentations:  The presentations should be be fast-paced, appropriate, and candid with multiple current examples that will strengthen EPA senior official's knowledge, skills and understanding of the importance of being prepared for media interviews or events.  The first large session will involve all 50 senior officials and last approximately 4 hours.  The second large session will be scheduled after all 50 one-on-one media training sessions are completed and will last approximately 2 hours. 
2. Conduct One-on-One Video Training: During the 1-hour one-on-one training, the Contractor will video up to 4-5 rounds of an in-depth interview with each trainee, as time allows. The Contractor shall measure and assess the individual's performance and provide written specific tips for the areas requiring improvement. In the given training time, the trainee may do subsequent on-camera practice using the tips and recommendations provided by the Contractor. The original video recordings and any copies shall become the property of EPA.  No copies of the any training shall leave EPA Headquarters. At a minimum, the recording shall be placed on DVD. Follow-up one-on-one media training will be scheduled on an as-needed-basis after the second large group session.  EPA will schedule up to 24 of these over the remaining time in the contract. The Contractor shall again provide an assessment of the individual's performance and suggested improvements.  
3. Provide Training Materials: Each one-on-one session participant shall receive takeaway materials from the large group session, and shall include the additional materials generated from the trainer's assessment, recommendation and specific tips each interviewee should remember prior to every interview.  
4. Provide a draft consolidated assessment report to EPA for review and approval: After all 50 one-on-one sessions are completed, the Contractor shall provide a single report with the findings, assessments, recommendations, and tips by individual participants. The report shall also provide a recommendation as to which individuals are recommended for a second one-on-one session. The Contractor shall meet with EPA's representatives to present and discuss the findings and schedule the second round of one-on-one sessions.  Upon EPA's approval, the Contractor shall provide a final consolidated report which includes the second round of one-on-one sessions.
Work Location:  All work will be located at EPA Headquarters in Washington DC.
The Contractor and EPA project officer shall meet within the first week of award to establish meeting schedules and logistics, review available spaces for the conduct of the large group and one-on-one sessions and establish dates for the large group session and subsequent one-on-one sessions.  The large group session will be scheduled the following week.
TECHNICAL DIRECTION
EPA will provide technical direction on each request for support with specifics for translation, interpretation, equipment, location, hours, number of pages to be translated, etc. 
The following clause, EPAAR 1552.237-71 Technical Direction, will be applicable to this requirement.  It is hereby included as part of this synopsis/solicitation and provided in full text below.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>Description<br /><br />The work ordered under this contract may be performed in any Government-owned building or Government-leased space within Richmond, Charlottesville, Harrisonburg, Lynchburg, Danville, Norfolk, and Portsmouth, in the Commonwealth of Virginia including but not limited to repairs, alterations, renovations and modernization of buildings or portions thereof. This will be an indefinite quantity term construction contract for projects ranging from approximately $500 to $100,000. The Government intends on selecting a minimum of two (2) contractors and a maximum of four (4) contractors for said contract. The exact number of awardees will be determined by the Source Selection Team during the evaluation of proposals and will be based primarily on the number, location, and capabilities of the highest rated firms as well as GSA's anticipated workload over the term of the contract.<br /><br />This solicitation is being issued as a small business set-aside. It is the Government's intent to make an award of this solicitation to an 8(a) Firm, a Disabled Veteran Owned Firm and a Very Small Business. If, after receipt and evaluation of proposals, GSA determines that an award to a Woman Owned, a Disabled Veteran Owned, or a Very Small Business cannot be made based on not meeting the requirements outlined in this solicitation, the Government reserves the right to make an award based on the submissions received and within the established competitive range. If, after receipt and evaluation of all proposals, GSA determines that between 2 and 4 awards cannot be made to small business firms that meet all of the requirements outlined in this solicitation, the Government reserves the right to reissue this requirement under full and open competition. The estimated annual dollar value of all of the projects that will be issued under the multiple term contracts can be found by applying the contractor's offer percentage to the government estimate total. The maximum limitation per year shall be 150% of the awarded offer price. Individual delivery orders may be competed among the selected firms under the contract unless the Government deems otherwise for a specific delivery order. The proposed performance period is a total of 5 years, consisting of 1 base year, with the possibility of four (1) year option periods. This requirement is being set aside for small business concerns under NAICS Code 236220 and the Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 million. Requests for a copy of the request for proposal solicitation should be e-mailed, faxed or mailed to the attention of Mrs. Rosemary Epperson. The mailing address is: GSA Region 3, Richmond Field Office (3PSSR), Robinson &amp; Merhige Federal Courthouse, 701 East Broad Street, Suite 4600, Richmond, VA 23219-1887. The fax number is (215) 446-6129. The e-mail addresses are shown below. Telephone requests will not be accepted. The Request for Proposal shall be available on or about May, 13, 2010. Proposals will be due approximately June 11, 2010. There will be no public opening of offers.

<DESC>The US Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for a strategic membership which allows the USGS the ability to collaborate in extensive research and development on geospatial standards.  This membership is known to be available only from the Open GIS Consortium as the only provider of the service because they are the only voluntary consensus industry standardization organization which covers the geospatial domain.  The USGS is aware of no other source that can provide the above.  Therefore, it intends to make an award to the Open GIS Consortium, unless it is contacted by any vendor who believes he can provide the same membership.  Vendors are invited to contact the Contracting Officer at vfloyd@usgs.gov no later than 05/05/2010 with an affirmative answer.
Membership renewal with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is sought for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).  The USGS is the lead agency designated by the Department of the Interior for the development and adoption of geospatial standards.  OMB Circular A-119 required federal agencies to participate in such voluntary consensus standards groups to contribute federal requirements to the standardization process.  Participation in the standards development process is limited to member organizations.  Under this membership, all disciplines within the USGS are eligible to participate, covering geospatial standardization issues in water resources, geology, biology, and geography.  No organization other than the OGC provides a forum for voluntary-consensus industry standards development.  
Participation in the OGC allows members the ability to collaborate in extensive research and development on geospatial standards that would be many times more costly than if work were conducted independently.  Members can collaborate on Interoperability Program initiatives, including testbeds and pilot projects as collaboration events.  As a result of this process, all standards that are developed become freely available to anyone over the Internet, increasing the outreach and adoption of the standards.  Membership in the OGC allows the USGS to fulfill its obligations under OMB Circular A-119, maintain leadership in geospatial standards development, and promotes the open exchange of geospatial data between USGS and hundreds of other organizations.  Failure by USGS to maintain membership in OGC would jeopardize the status of the Bureau as a designated lead agency.

<DESC>This is a <strong>Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information only</strong>. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract as a result of this request for information. The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of the business community to include the small business community. The 46th Test Group is conducting market research to determine the availability of sources which can develop an innovative, efficient, low-cost means of capturing full-hemisphere, open-air, fragment mass, geometry, and velocity information during warhead characterization tests. <br /><br /><strong>Background</strong>: The present method of warhead characterization is costly, labor intensive, and produces only a piece of the required data. A warhead is placed in the center of an arena consisting of any combination of blast-pressure gages and fragment collection media. Fragment collection media (often celotex) are placed just above ground level and arc around the warhead at a radius that is a function of the net explosive weight. While this radius ensures bundle survival during blast-pressure impingement, bundles occupy only a small slice of the hemisphere. As such, only a fraction of the fragments are captured for inclusion in the subsequent warhead characterization analysis. Weeks of tedious and error-prone labor are necessary to locate, recover, weigh, and describe the geometry of each fragment entering the bundles. Many small fragments are not recovered and few if any individual fragments are mapped to their specific velocities. In order to develop a more-complete dataset for user consumption, analysts subject raw warhead test data to a series of assumptions, averages, rotations, and summarizations to produce an approximation of the true warhead's fragment mass and velocity field. While checks and balances are in place to assure that overall data appear reasonable, individual fragment masses/geometries remain uncoupled from their velocities and many of the smaller fragments are simply not included in the dataset. <br /><br />All warhead characterizations (and data reduction methods) to date have been conservatively-skewed based on a lethality-mindset. As such, true munitions lethalities are higher than their arena test scores. This is diametrically opposed to CENTCOM's collateral damage mindset and requirement to obtain higher fidelity warhead fragmentation/debris data for much of the current inventory of fielded weapons. Current procedures make high-fidelity re-test prohibitively time consuming, expensive, and technically problematic. Delays in missions can result where high casualties or collateral damage are estimated. To resolve the matter, an innovative combined sensor/software technology is needed whereby sensors can assess object movement within large hemispherical volumes (15 to 300 feet in diameter) at sufficient resolution to detect solid-mass (0.5 gram to 100 kilogram) high-velocity (5 to 8000 feet per second) particles (numbering up to 5000) originating near the center of the hemispherical test space and moving within that volume. The interrogation method must be capable of mapping individual fragment masses to their velocities. The proposed interrogation system must be suitable for open-air outdoor testing and sufficiently robust to handle blast overpressures ranging from 1000 psi near the center of the hemispherical test space to 1 psi near the fringes. In addition to mapped fragment mass-velocity data, the technology must be capable of estimating each fragment's geometry. The proposed interrogation system must be capable of setup by no more than two technicians within a single workday, produce an automated post-test report containing fully mapped fragment mass-velocity data within 1 hour of the test, and provide confirmation that the test process accounts for 99% of the warhead's mass. Innovators are encouraged to take maximum advantage of commercial off the shelf (COTS) sub-technologies. <br />Interested companies should identify system concepts and provide examples that support the technical feasibility of capturing warhead fragmentation information in an automated method such that each fragment mass is immediately mapped to its velocity, where the velocity vector is applied to assess fragment origin. Companies should discuss a proposed path forward (i.e., bench level testing) for development of selected technologies necessary to prove the concept worthy of full-scale pursuit.

This contract will provide technical and analytical expertise for the modification of BBU-63/B Bomb Ejection Impulse Cartridges to provide the BRU-44B/A ejection rack with the explosive energy required for ejection.</p>
<p>AFNWC/PKE intends to solicit and negotiate a contract on a sole source basis under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii), Only One Responsible Source, to Scot Inc. This authority allows for "supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment when it is likely" and award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. This NOCA is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the requirement. <br />Based on an evaluation of the Ogden Air Logistics Center AMC/AMSC Screening Analysis Worksheet Report, there are only two approved sources of supply for the Impulse Cartridges with the National Stock Number of 1377015028981 that is Scot Inc. and Ogden Air Logistics Center.</p>
<p>Since the cartridges are designed for use on the B-2 aircraft and the structural and functional integrity can be affected by individual manufacturer's processes and techniques, the part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. To ensure continued product integrity, procurement is restricted to sources known to have the required experience and capability. New potential sources must be approved prior to contract award. However, due to the purpose of this contract effort, award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements and further details are provided in paragraph 8 below.</p>
<p>The recent purchase history from Scot Inc. includes the following contracts: FA821308C0062, FA821308C0051, and FA821308C0050. This purchase history demonstrates, Scot Inc. is the original manufacturer of the current BBU-63/B cartridges in the Air Force inventory that will be modified during this contract effort.</p>
<p>8. Description of the Efforts Needed Statement of Work (SOW): The 498th NSG and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) plan to conduct BRU 44B/A rack testing. The objective of the BRU 44B/A rack test is to characterize the shock and vibration environment of the ejection event. The BBU 63/B cartridge performance is a key part of the ejection environment. In order to define all possible ejection environments, the testing will require customized BBU 63/B cartridges that perform at the edges of the current BBU 63/B cartridge's production specifications. Under this contract, the Government will provide 180 BBU-63/B cartridges as Government Furnished Material (GFM). The offeror will deliver 120 modified BBU 63/B cartridges, which meet the specific performance requirements necessary for the Air Force and SNL BRU 44B/A rack testing. In addition, the offeror will conduct 60 Closed Bomb Tests (CBTs), using the offeror's testing facility, in order to characterize the performance of the modified cartridges. The offeror will have 5 months to complete the contract effort. To ensure validity of the data and successful BRU-44B/A testing, it is critical to control as many variables as possible during the cartridge modification and testing process. Using the only approved source of supply, whom is also the original manufacturer of the cartridges, and using this sources' CBT facility will ensure no new variables are introduced into this critical testing process. To approve a new source of supply to conduct the modification and testing would therefore result in substantial duplication of costs and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. <br />9. All responsible sources, including Scot Inc., may submit a capability statement in order to demonstrate their ability to fulfill the above requirements within the period of performance. The Statement of Capability (SOC) shall contain the information: (a) Demonstrate ability perform CBT, (b) demonstrate prior expertise in building impulse cartridges, (c) demonstrate an understanding of how to modify the cartridges and provide a notional plan to show the cartridges can be modified within 5 months of contract start, (d) provide resumes on key personnel and their expertise in building and modifying impulse cartridges. Please make sure that your information includes your company's CAGE Code and current Central Contractor Registration (CCR) information, DUNS number, financial information, business size, and other information deemed relevant to be capable of satisfying the government's need. Firms responding should indicate if they are a Small Business, a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business, an 8(a) Certified Business, a Woman-Owned Business and/or a HUBZone Certified Small Business Concern. To be considered a Small Business the following applies: NAICS Code: 541712, aircraft parts, auxiliary equipment, and aircraft engine parts exception, size standard 1000 employees. <br />a. Page limitation: The SOC is limited to a total of 10 pages, single spaced, 12-point font, Times New Roman. The Government will not consider pages in excess of the limitation. Key personnel and resume information is not included in the page count.</p>

<DESC>Multi runway switch for FMQ-19 Automatic Meteorological Station
<p>For planning and information purposes the Ogden Air Logistics Center, 500th Combat Sustainment Systems Flight (500 CBSS/GBLG) is seeking sources for the capability to allow air traffic controllers to designate the active instrumented runway heading of each military location with an FMQ-19 Automatic Meteorological Station (AMS) Weather Weapon System. It will optionally include the capability to detect and provide changes in runway light intensity. This work applies to US Air Force and US Army locations that have the FMQ-19 AMS and have multiple runways. This may be installed at all FMQ-19 AMS locations. Maximum installation would be 109 locations and 112 systems, including two mockups. The anticipated contract period is for 24 months after notice of award.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB); it is only to obtain market capabilities/industry comments and is to be used for informational purposes only.

<DESC>Sources Sought <br />Reference # 2010-83322
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (CDC), is currently seeking sources for qualified companies/contractors, to provide services listed therein this advertisement. This award may be awarded in accordance with FAR 13 using simplified acquisition procedures. These services will be performed in Angola, Africa. If any company can meet the technical requirements below you are welcome to submit your capability statement as directed at the end of this advertisement.<br />Any organization or individual doing business with the government must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Follow link below for registration details.<br />https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx.<br />Performance Work Statement</p>
<p><br /><br />Performance Work Statement</p>
<p>Title of Project: <br />Behavioral and Serologic Surveillance of Long Distance Truck Drivers and their Assistants in Angola</p>
<p><br />To better understand the relationships among populations, HIV prevalence, and existing services, CDC:<br />Builds in-country capacity to design, implement, and evaluate HIV/AIDS-related surveillance systems and surveys; and assists and trains countries on how to analyze, disseminate, and use HIV/AIDS data. <br />Develops tools, guidelines, recommendations, and policies to translate research for improved planning and program implementation. <br />Evaluates and implements novel approaches for conducting surveillance and surveys.</p>
<p>Considering the well reported importance of monitoring the epidemics and the behavior of most at risk populations (MARPs) for HIV, the Instituto Nacional de Luta contra a SIDA (INLS) has requested assistance in conducting behavioral and serologic surveillance (BSS) in Angola with MARPs. <br />Based on the results of a qualitative assessment with most at risk populations in the provinces of Luanda and Cunene, it was recommended that BSS to be conducted with men who have sex with men (MSM) in Luanda, long distance truck drivers in both Luanda and Cunene provinces, and young women involved in transactional sex in the border region of Cunene. <br />This request for contract is to conduct a BSS among long distance truck drivers in Luanda and Cunene.<br />Although no serological data is available for truck drivers in Angola, several studies have identified them as a vulnerable population for acquiring and transmitting STI (sexually transmitted infections), including HIV, in different locations throughout the world. HIV risk in this population is driven by the mobile nature of their work, which makes them move away from protective social networks, including family and broader communities, and may result in greater exposure to risky behaviors while traveling (Lippman et al., 2007). Following Angola's civil war, the borders of neighboring countries opened, allowing greater mobility to and from neighbor countries with generalized HIV epidemics. As a result, long distance truck drivers have become an important population for acquiring and transmitting STI/HIV.</p>
<p>2 Project Objectives</p>
<p>To assist the Government of Angola in understanding the HIV epidemic among long distance truck drivers, CDC will support a behavioral and serological surveillance (BSS) baseline survey for the targeted population.</p>
<p>The objectives of the survey are:</p>
<p>1) Examine attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions of risk related to HIV and STD among truck drivers;<br />2) Estimate HIV and syphilis prevalence among truck drivers; and <br />3) Develop capacity within the Ministry of Health to implement subsequent BSS surveys among most at risk populations for HIV.</p>
<p>This information collected will be used by program managers and planners to develop and improve HIV prevention and care programs for the target population.<br /><br />3 Scope of Work</p>
<p>BSS will include an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire along with biological testing for syphilis and HIV.</p>
<p>Phase 1: Protocol Development,</p>
<p>&bull; Develop a comprehensive, cross-cutting protocol that includes behavioral and serologic data collection among long distance truck drivers and their assistants in Luanda and Cunene. <br />&bull; Obtain required Institutional Review Board approvals or exemptions.</p>

<p>&bull; Recruit long distance truck drivers and their assistants to participate in the survey.<br />&bull; Conduct in-depth interviews with eligible survey participants.<br />&bull; Provide HIV counseling and testing services.<br />&bull; Collect and test syphilis and HIV specimen.<br />&bull; Provide clinical services and referrals for participants with positive test results and participants with complaints of STIs.<br />&bull; Follow-up with participants that have reactive tests results.<br />&bull; Pay participant allowances.</p>
<p>Phase 3: Data Management and Analysis</p>
<p>&bull; Analyze both quantitative and quality data collected.<br />&bull; Summarize analyses.</p>
<p>Phase 4: Dissemination of Results</p>

Also, this notice is provided as information to the marketplace and is an invitation for an expression of interest and demonstration of capability to perform the anticipated work. The Government will not pay for the provision of any information nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information.
The NIAC code is 56149.  The maximum average annual sales over last three years is $7.0 million .
The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") has a requirement for a Master Servicer and Administrative Agent for DOE?s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM). This Project will be a Recovery Act funded contract.  The Master Servicer  will monitor and oversee loan servicing by administrative agents and collateral agents appointed by lenders in connection with loans guaranteed under Section 136 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.  Loans value range from $25 Million to $750 Million.
The Administrative Agent will perform certain agent duties and functions, including the duties and functions of Collateral Agent, Custodian, Registrar, Paying and Transfer Agent, Depository Bank, Insurance Advisor and, as directed by DOE Facility Agent and Intercreditor Agent for any loan or other debt obligation of a borrower that is guaranteed by the DOE.  The Administrative Agent will have primary responsibility for fulfilling all of the foregoing duties.
In addition to the responsibilities set forth below, the Administrative Agent shall be required to: 
-give notices or provide instructions on behalf of DOE to any person under the loan and guarantee documents in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof; 	- maintain and provide to DOE a quality assurance plan; 
-provide all deliverables in electronic formats compatible with the LGPO's software applications; and

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses. This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, Solicitation, Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this sources sought. Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.
<p>Currently the Food and Drug Administration, Division of Product Quality Research has an urgent need to upgrade its Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC). The requirement is for a system that meets or exceeds the following requirements:</p>
<p>Temperature Range: -75&deg;C to 500&deg;C. This temperature range must be accomplished through the use of mechanical cooling without the need of using liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p>Calorimeter Sensitivity: The Indium peak height/width ratio (i.e., response ration) of the calorimeter must be &gt; 50. The indium peak height/width ratio is a measure of the sensitivity and resolution of the DSC instrument, with higher value indicating higher sensitivity and better resolution.</p>
<p>Robotic Auto-sampler: Because this instrument will be used extensively, and often on a 24 hour basis, it must come equipped with a robotic auto-sampler containing at least 40 sample positions which shall be controllable through a touch-screen display, or by some other means independent of the controlling computer. In addition, as the sample pans employed may vary from run to run, the auto-sampler must also be capable of exchanging the reference pan (at least three positions) and accommodate a variety of DSC pan types, including but not limited to: standard, hermetic, open, and high-volume pans. The calibration of this auto-sampler should be automated such that a typical user can fully calibrate the system in less than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Purge Gas Control: The DSC should include digital mass flow controllers for at least two separate purge gases, such that the purge gas can be automatically switched via software during the experiment. The flow rate must also be adjustable via software during an experiment. The flow rates must be data logged into the resulting data file.</p>
<p>Cell Replacement: Due to the anticipated heavy use of this instrument, it may be necessary to periodically replace the DSC transducer cell. This replacement must be accomplished by the user, without the need for a service visit. The instrument should also accommodate specialty cells, such as a high-pressure cell, as it may also be used to study super-critical reactions. These specialty cells should be user-replaceable, and require little or no special installation.</p>
<p>Temperature Modulated DSC: The instrument must be capable of performing temperature modulated DSC experiments over the entire temperature operating range and must be capable of performing these experiments in heating, cooling, or pseudo-isothermal modes (pseudo-isothermal is defined as an average isothermal temperature with superimposed modulation). The pseudo-isothermal mode is critical for our research, as we intend to study time-dependent effects on heat capacity at isothermal temperature.</p>
<p>The modulated temperature profile must be a regular, periodic function of known amplitude and frequency to ensure steady state control during the experiment, as well as experimental reproducibility. Random temperature perturbations are less reproducible and as such are not acceptable for our research.</p>
<p>Software: As this DSC will be used by numerous researchers, it is critical that the analysis software be un-keyed, and should include a site license such that it may be installed (if-needed) on an unlimited number of computers within the FDA. The data file format should easily allow sharing/transfer of data files as individual electronic documents. The data analysis program should also include a .pdf generator, for the efficient export of analyzed plots. These capabilities must be demonstrated for product acceptance.</p>
<p>The user must be able to monitor, record and access both the raw signals, as well as the deconvoluted signal [including heat capacity, total heat flow, heat flow phase, modulation-dependent (heat capacity) heat flow, and modulation-independent (kinetic) heat flow] in real time, while the experiment is being performed.</p>
<p>In addition, the instrument software must be capable of performing a series of auto-diagnostic tests, either manually or through the scheduling component allowing for the instrument to be fully calibrated and verified automatically, without the need for operator presence. Calibrations must include baseline, cell constant, and temperature. Scheduling capabilities must be present, such that these calibrations and/or verifications can be programmed to perform during normal quiescent periods, such as overnight or on weekends. Options for additional tests verifying the performance of various instrument components such as auto-sampler, motors, electronic boards, mass flow controllers, etc. must also be present.</p>
<p>Small Businesses are encouraged to respond if they have the capability and capacity to provide the identified services. Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice. However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents' capacity and capability to perform the specific work as required. Responses must directly demonstrate the company's capability, experience, and/or ability to marshal resources to effectively and efficiently perform the task described above at a sufficient level of detail to allow definitive numerical evaluation; and evidence that the contractor can satisfy the minimum requirements listed above while in compliance with FAR 52.219-14 ("Limitations on Subcontracting"). Failure to definitively address each of these factors will result in a finding that respondent lacks capability to perform the work. Responses to this notice shall be limited to 5 pages, and must include:</p>
<p>1. Company name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers, website address (if available), and the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives.</p>
<p>2. Name, title, telephone number, and e-mail addresses of individuals who can verify the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses.</p>
<p>3. If qualified as an 8(a) firm (must be certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA), Small Disadvantaged Business (must be certified by SBA), Woman-Owned Small Business, HUBZone firm (must be certified by SBA), and/or Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (must be listed in the VetBiz Vendor Information Pages).</p>
<p>4. DUNS number, CAGE Code, Tax Identification Number (TIN), and company structure (Corporation, LLC, partnership, joint venture, etc). Companies also must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov to be considered as potential sources.</p>
<p>5. Identification of any GSA Schedule contract(s) by Schedule number and contract number and SINs that are applicable to this potential requirement are also requested.</p>
<p>6. If the company has a Government approved accounting system, please identify the agency that approved the system. Please submit copies of any documentation, such as letters or certificates to indicate the firm's status (see item #3 above). To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information. Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly protected from disclosure. Interested offerors should submit their capability statement not exceeding five (5) pages in length.</p>
<p>Phone calls will not be accepted or returned. Interested firms or individuals may submit the requested information to: george.gonzalez@fda.hhs.gov or</p>

Statement of work

Background

The NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) is in need of a computer-controlled, focused acoustic ultra-high throughput instrument to shear DNA samples efficiently, obtain high yields, higher reproducibility, ensure sample integrity and handle multiple samples at the same time which will reduce labor costs. The AFA (acoustic focused acoustic) produces controlled acoustic field inside a closed vessel to better control the processing of each sample and ensure uniform results.  By focusing the energy to a small localized area, more energy is applied directly to the sample for greater efficiency and decreased processing time.  DNA samples NISC (NIH Intramural Sequencing Center) obtains may be of small quantity and of human nature; therefore, it needs to be handled precisely without fault and no cross-contamination of other samples. Eventually the samples will be processed through a high-throughput sequencer. The instrument needs to handle multiple samples (up to 96) at one time and able to shear DNA to small sizes.  

The instrument will accommodate a range of sample volume and is very quiet and protective ear covering is not required.  This instrument will be operated in a general lab space and individual tubes will be used for each sample so there is no risk of cross-contamination.  Since some of the samples that NISC work with are very precious; minimal loss is key and a significant sample loss of 10% during process cannot happen.  An integrated water bath insures a constant temperature to assure reproducibility and the highest sample integrity.  The instrument will focus and control the ultrasonic energy to the localized area to provide consistent processing of the sample.

<DESC>NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Toptica Photonics of Victor, NY for their Toptica DL 100 pro design diode laser system.
<p>Background: The laser is needed for NOAA's recently developed Aerosol Scattering to Extinction Ration (ASTER) instrument. The instrument requires an extended cavity diode laser (ECDL) that is grating stabilized, single mode, low noise, and that can accept current modulation at frequencies of several megahertz to enable a very stable lock. Given the high modulation frequencies, it is critical that the current modulation port be a 50 ohm input to match the impedance of the locking circuitry already developed for ASTER. The main component of the current ASTER locking circuitry is the Toptica Digilock module, which has a 50 ohm output for current modulation. The Toptica laser is required to integrate with the Toptica Digilock which entitles NOAA to full support from Toptica.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on NOAA's market research showing that no other sources with low noise, grating stabilized, single mode lasers at the required wavelength of 672 nm are able meet all requirements. An upper limit for the modulation frequency of 1 MHz is too low for use in ASTER. Required Technical Specifications include: Single mode extended cavity diode laser; Linewidth in the hundreds of kilohertz range; Mode hop free tuning range of tens of gigahertz; Grating Stabilized (tuning range of a few nm); Beam stabilized to avoid need for realignment with tuning; Very low susceptibility to thermal and acoustic disturbances; Low Noise diode current controller (&lt; 1 microamp up to a megahertz)<br />50 ohm current modulation input; Current modulation bandwidth of several megahertz. Delivery is required on or before 12 weeks after receipt of order (ARO). <br />***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 10 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>This serves as "Notice of Intent" of Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command (HQ AFRC/A7KA) intent to issue a modification to increase the ceiling on the basic Commandwide O &amp; M Project Execution Contract (COMPEC) on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1. The existing COMPEC contracts are FA6643-08-D-0001 (AECOM), FA6643-08-D-0002 (Weston Solutions), FA6643-08-D-0003 (Geo-Marine Inc), FA6643-08-D-0004 (CDM/CAPE), FA6643-08-D-0005 (ITSI), and FA6643-08-D-0006 (EMR). The increased ceiling is for an additional $78M. The Air Force (AF) plans to extend COMPEC for the six prime contractors under the authority of Title 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B). There would be significant risk to AF if COMPEC is not extended to bridge the gap between it and the COMPEC II Follow-on acquisition which is currently underway. COMPEC is the commandwide IDIQ for construction projects to improve facility infrastructure at AFRC bases and tenant locations throughout the Continental United States (CONUS). The nature of the acquisition requires the use of the stated exceptions to the general requirement for full and open competition. The increase in the COMPEC ceiling is necessary and will allow AFRC to continue to execute task order contracts during FY10 and FY11 while concurrently AFRC will be establishing a follow-on task order contract for the FY11 and out-year construction programs. By granting the authority for the ceiling increase, this will allow AFRC sufficient time to develop and award a competitive follow-on task order contract for the future construction programs. The follow-on multiple award IDIQ for COMPEC was slated to commence in late 2010, however due to the increased construction program at AFRC, this acquisition had to be accelerated and all reasonable available acquisition resources are now being dedicated to complete the follow-on effort. Conducting a separate competition for a short-term bridge contract would dramatically delay the current competition for the replacement contract and, more importantly, would delay the implementation of a more complex acquisition vehicle to complete the implementation of an acquisition for the command wide construction strategic sourcing IDIQ. NAICS code 237990 applies. Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement within 15 days after the publication date of this notice of contract action. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Inquiries can be mailed to the Contracting Officer, Mark Dillinger, 255 Richard Ray Blvd, Robins AFB, GA 31098-1637 or e-mailed to mark.dillinger.1@us.af.mil. Numbered Notes 22 and 26 apply.

United States Department of the InteriorClass Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition AndWaiver of Publication Requirements
Federal law (41.US.C. 253(c)(1)) and FAR 6.302-1 authorizes under certain conditions, including only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements, contracting without providing for full and open competition.  Exceptions are also authorized to the statutory requirements in the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(e)) and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 416), to provide public notice of contracting opportunities.
J&A FAR 6.302-1 - Services to supply suitability modeling and data analysis for the Ivory-billed Woodpecker.
Justification and Approval DocumentFOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONUse for requirements not exceeding $100,000

1.  Contracting Activity: Fish & Wildlife Service, Contracting & Grant Services 
2.  Description of Action:
     Requirement: New      Pricing: Firm-Fixed Price               Funds: 47750-1113-IBWP  FY09			Name of Intended Contractor:	 SIGMALOGISTIC CONSULTING INC.
Street Address: 2418 UNION ST
City, State, Zip:  SAN DIEGO, CA    92101-1320
Phone: 619.261.1537

3.  Description of Services:  The estimated value of the proposed action is $ _24,000.00_____ .  Describe the services or supplies, including make & model number, to be acquired below.      Dr. Jeff Tracey (Sigmalogistic Consulting) was responsible for the coding of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker Stochastic Habitat Suitability Model that was developed for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Intergovernmental Agreement # 401816N012.  The software developed by Dr. Tracey permitted the incorporation of uncertainty in our understanding of Ivory-billed Woodpecker habitat in assessments of current habitat suitability across the historic range of the bird.  A recent compilation of historical Ivory-billed Woodpecker sightings provides an opportunity to verify the habitat suitability model and assess its utility for developing potential conservation strategies for this species based on current estimates or future projections of connectivity and/or forest inventory projections across the entire geographic range of the bird.  Dr. Tracey's expertise with the existing Ivory-billed Woodpecker habitat suitability model and the accompanying software is essential for the successful achievement of these objectives.  For this reason, Sigmalogistic Consulting is a uniquely qualified vendor to supply the specified modeling and data analysis requirements detailed in this purchase order.

4.  Authority Cited:  (Identify the statutory authority, FAR title and FAR citation permitting other than full and open competition.  It may be one of the following.)
       (a)  10 USC 2304(c)(1) or 41 USC 253(c)(1); FAR 6.302-1:  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements

5.  Reason for Authority Cited: (State why this is the only source that can provide the required supplies or services.)          (b)  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.
       (d)  Additional Information:	(i)  What harm will come to the Government if desired supplies/services are not provided on time?                        Already the Ivory-billed Woodpecker search effort is waning.  Inability to provide the data products                         from this effort in a timely manner may unnecessarily delay targeted search efforts that are                                     currently occurring (at significant expenditure to the Government) in the most likely locations for a                         sustainable population.
	(ii)  What harm will come to the Government if desired contractor doesn't receive the award?                       Dr. Jeff Tracey's (Sigmalogistic Consulting) already intimate knowledge of the Ivory-billed                                         Woodpecker Stochastic Habitat Suitability Model results in significant cost savings to the                                         Government, as the costs associated with familiarizing a new contractor with the model would be                          significant in terms of existing U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service staff time and use of available funds on                       new research.
6.  Actions to Increase Competition: (State what actions will be taken to increase competition before subsequent acquisition of the supplies or services is required.)      The model and the data products derived from it will be shared with biologists and the public through both scientific publications and the web (www.lmvjv.org).  These means of dissemination will permit others to learn about the mechanics of the model, facilitating competition for further research surrounding its application. 
7.  Market Survey:  (Describe the extent of the market survey conducted to identify all qualified sources and the results thereof.  "Market Survey" is defined as those attempts you made to ascertain whether other qualified sources exist.  The survey of the market place may consist of written, telephonic, or world wide web inquiries.)      The Lower Mississippi Valley Joint Venture is a formal long-standing partnership comprised of three federal natural resource and science agencies, nine state fish and wildlife agencies, and four conservation-based non-profit organizations.  The US Fish and Wildlife Service solicited input from these agencies and organizations as well as affiliated academic institutions in search of a suitable entity that could provide these unique services.

8.  Procurement History:
	Previous Contract or Purchase Order Number:  N/A	Previously competed? N/A		9.  Technical / Requirements Certification:  I certify that the support data under my cognizance which are included in this J&A are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICIATATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health, Department of Clinical Research Informatics intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 United States Code (U.S.C.) 253(c)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 a contract Extreme Z IP to manage the Mac shares hosted on our main fileservers.</p>
<p>The NIH Clinical Center uses Extreme Z IP to manage the Mac shares hosted on our main fileservers. Microsoft removed the services support for Mac shares with Windows Server 2003. Because 40% of the CC users have Apple computers it was necessary for us to continue supporting their access to the CC Fileservers.</p>
<p><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541511 and the threshold is $25 million dollars. The anticipated period of performance will is a base year plus 4 option years.</p>
<p>The ExtremeZ-IP software system is proprietary to GroupLogic who developed it. GroupLogic does not permit 3rd party maintenance and will not release their source code to other entities. The proprietary status of the system to GroupLogic clearly demonstrates that they are the only firm qualified to perform the required maintenance services.</p>
<p>The ExtremeZ IP software is responsible for managing the Apple based computers access to the CC SAN shares. The software is needed to support those users since Microsoft discontinued supporting the software with the release of Windows 2003 server software. Without the software our Mac users would not be able to attach to their home or departmental shares.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however all responses received within 5 days from the date of the publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability in writing to Mr. Brian Lind at the address stated above. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. There is no solicitation package available.

Larson Davis, Inc will supply additional customized sound level meters and associated parts for ongoing field data collection to support Air Tour Management Plans though out the Olympic National Park, Port Angeles, WA (See Sole Source Justification below). Under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), the value of the contract is expected to be under $17,000.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement.  Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement.  A solicitation is not available.  Please email contract specialist, Emma Lynch with responses or questions regarding this requirement at emma_lynch@nps.gov
The National Park Service (NPS), Olympic National Park requirement:
OVERVIEW
The Natural Sounds Program requires additional sound level meters and associated parts for ongoing field data collection to support Air Tour Management Plans. Larson Davis meters have been used by the NSP to collect tens of thousands of hours of data. NPS Natural Sounds Program staff, CESU staff, and staff at various National Park units have been trained to use this equipment. The Natural Sounds Program has developed several pieces of software dedicated to this product.
Larson Davis is the only producer of sound level meters that meets Natural Sounds Program needs for data logging capacity, low power consumption, and ease of use. The cost of retraining staff, modifying associated equipment and power systems, and rewriting the supporting software would significantly delay upcoming field work, and add enormous costs to the monitoring effort.
AUTHORITY
41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies of services will satisfy agency requirements;  and Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1) provides for soliciting from a single source if the procurement does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and the contracting officer determines that only one source is reasonably available.. 
JUSTIFICATION
1. Agency Identification: Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Air Resources Division, Natural Sounds Program
2.  Nature or Description of Action Being Approved:  Purchase of three (3) Larson Davis 831 Sound Level Meters and required cables.
3.  Description of Supplies or Services Required:   The project requires ANSI Type 1 sound level meters than can: a.     collect calibrated, one second 1/3 octave band data,b.     log this information in a machine readable and easily transferable format,c.     integrate with current NPS remote data collection software.
4.  Demonstration that proposed contractor's unique qualifications or nature of the acquisition requires the use of the authority cited:  Larson Davis meters have been extensively used by the NPS Natural Sounds Program as well as several park units.  In addition, extensive software packages have been written that are specific to the data produced by Larson Davis sound level meters.  
5.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practical, including whether a CBD notice was or will be publicized as required by subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:  FAR subpart 5.202(a)(13)(i) "amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold."
6.  Contracting Officer's Determination That Cost is Fair and Reasonable:  The cost for three units is under $22,000, and will be purchased directly from the manufacturer. NPS is getting a discount on this equipment that distributors cannot offer.
7.  Description of market survey conducted: A survey was conducted of all of the equipment available at the 2009 Internoise conference in Ottawa. No other manufacturer can meet our needs. Cirrus CR-831B sound level meter cannot provide Leq analysis at one second intervals (The NPS and FAA standard), as well as having poor external data logging features. The Quest Technologies SProDLX Type 1 is not capable of measurements as sensitive as the Larson Davis model, and it requires three times as much power to operate. The Brel & Kjr 2250 and 2270 sound level meters have comparable features but unacceptably high power consumption. Low power consumption is a critical feature for long term deployments at remote sites. Larson Davis provides the needed features of data logging capacity, low power consumption, and ease of use.
8.  Other facts supporting use of other than full and open competition: Cost of retraining employees and revising NPS support software.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, VA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis a firm fixed price modification to contract M67854-05-D-6014 with General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems (GDOTS), St. Petersburg, FL. This procurement is for spares in support of the following systems procured under the contract; M327 Mortars, ammunition trailers, EFSS prime movers and light strike vehicles.  Statutory authority for this sole source purchase is under Title 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The spare parts are in support of the production, fielding, and sustainment of the Internally Transportable Vehicles (ITV) and the Expeditionary Fire Support System (EFSS). GD-OTS is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), and sole producer of the EFSS and ITV. The original contract was competed. The ITV and EFSS consist of over 100,000 parts for which GD-OTS has an established supply chain for production, and procedures in place for the acceptance, inspection and transfer of the parts to the ICLS contractor, Tec-Masters. The majority of the parts are not in the Government supply system, as they are initial production quantity issue, and only available from the OEM. The total value of this contract modification is not more than $7.5M. This is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested companies may submit affirmative responses to the requirement by May 5, 2010 to the following email address: Monica.Choudhury@usmc.mil. No telephone requests will be honored.

<p>General Duties / Description of Work</p>
<p>The laboratory at the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, <br />Division of Bacterial, Parasitic and Allergenic Products requires a service contract to maintain and repair Water UPLC system when needed.</p>
<p>This instrument is currently supporting mission-critical research of importance of glycosylation of viral antigens and pathogen-host carbohydrate dependent interactions. The analysis of study samples with this instrument will help FDA understand the carbohydrate role in vaccine production, as well as to test variability in glycans synthesis in different vaccine lots. The HPLC used for that purpose requires periodic maintenance and repair. As this instrument is crucial to the agency's mission it is important that the instrument repairs be in a timely manner. This requires an on-site visit by a qualified service engineer for timely repair of components and restoration and/or maintenance of operating conditions.</p>
<p>Location</p>

<p>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES FOR THIS SOLICITATION:<br />The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:<br />FAR 52.212-1; FAR 52.212-3; FAR 52.212-4; FAR 52.212-5, including 52.222-50, 52.233-3, and 52.233-4 in paragraph (a)(1), and the following fill-ins in paragraph (b): 52.219-6; 52.219-28; 52.222-3; 52.222-19; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-36; 52.225-13; 52.232-33. All provisions and clauses viewed at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html.</p>
<p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, does not apply to this acquisition because the user does not interact with the EIT product directly.</p>

All parties submitting bids must have a current weed management plan that has been approved by the local county weed board and Devils Tower National Monument.  All plans require one annual inspection by park staff during the growing season (June - August) prior to sale of material.  Parties submitting bids must provide proof of the most recent weed inspection by Devils Tower National Monument staff.
The weed inspection will designate a pit in one of three rating categories:  acceptable, conditionally acceptable, or unacceptable.  Sand and gravel from a pit designated as unacceptable can be used if the material is heat treated to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and promptly transported from the quarry to the park or a pre-approved weed free storage area to prevent possible weed contamination.
A list of weeds of concern, as well as information on current ratings of area gravel pit can be obtained from Devils Tower National Monument.  Contact: richard.steele@nps.gov.
The control of noxious weeds shall be achieved as follows:All vehicles and equipment to be used in Devils Tower National Monument shall be thoroughly pressure washed prior to arrival.  Equipment shall be inspected at the appropriate park entrance station by a designated park employee and only clean equipment shall be permitted into the park.  Particular attention must be shown to the under carriage and any surface where soil containing exotic weed seeds may exist.  All loaded trucks and trailers shall be covered (tarped) when loaded.   These efforts are critical to prevent the introduction and establishment of non-native plant species into the park.  Equipment inspection will be scheduled by the maintenance office and take place at the park entrance stations.  Inspection records shall be maintained by the park service.  Equipment found operating in the park that has not been inspected shall be dead-lined and subject to a citation.

This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Request For Quotation (RFQ) number is N66604-10-Q-2668. Incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-27. NUWC Division Newport intends to issue a Firm-Fixed Price contract on a Sole Source basis to Tews Technologies LLC.,  Reno, NV as they are the only known source for the following items: 
CLIN 0001- MPC8240-250 MHz 64 MB SDRAM 1+8 MB FLASH FAST ETHERNET FRONT PANEL I/O STANDARD. P/N TVME8240A-11-CC.     (QTY 14)
Required delivery must be 120 days after award.   Partial shipments and payment will be authorized; however, all units must be delivered within 120 days from date of award.  F.O.B. Destination Naval Station Newport; Newport, RI. The basis of this Sole Source is that the Encapsulated Harpoon Command and Launch Subsystem (EHCLS) III is the follow on development of the EHCLS II which was designed and built in 2001-2004.  Components of the Harpoon Data Processor (HDP) which are identical to that used in the EHCLS II HDP will be used for EHCLS III.  These components have already been integrated with system hardware and software and passed both Hardware Qualification Testing and System Final Qualification Testing.  Reusing EHCLS II components in the EHCLS III design reduces risk, capitalizes on previously conducted development and test work, and maintains commonality among all EHCLS products reducing provisioning burden while providing a common set of maintenance and operation procedures. Any other components would require extensive development and test efforts at a substantial cost to the government.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items applies.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

The offeror &#61551; does &#61551; does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

<p>REQUIREMENTS FOR USE: This engine and gearbox will be mounted on an engine stand (with prop attached) and used as a training assembly in the classroom. The components must be capable of being disassembled and reassembled repeatedly and must function in the same manner as RFI components would. Preference is to have a training assembly with all of the internal and external components included (e.g. Drive shaft, Drive shaft housing, PT Shaft Speed sensor, Propeller Brush Block, Fuel/Oil Heat Exchanger, Feather Pump, Prop Control Unit, DC Starter/Generator, etc, etc.).</p>
<p>Cost of shipping must be included in the quote, FOB Destination. Shipping destination is: USCG, Aviation Technical Training Center (ATTC), Elizabeth City, NC 27909. Item is needed within 45 days after receipt of order (ARO).</p>

<p><br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is included.</p>
<p>Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.<br />(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-<br />(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and<br />(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.<br />(l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).

<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Past performance</p>
<p>The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>PRICE -</p>
<p>(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical</p>
<p>quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(d) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>4. POSITION TITLE: Personnel and Operations Assistant</p>
<p>5. MARKET VALUE: The entry grade level of this position will be the equivalent of a GS-07 or GS-09, with locality pay. The actual salary of the successful candidate will be negotiated within the daily pay range depending on qualifications, salary and work history, experience and educational background. Salaries over and above the top of the pay range will not be entertained or negotiated. Candidates who live outside the Washington, D.C. area will be considered for employment but no relocation expenses will be reimbursed. The highest level of this position is GS-9.</p>
<p>This position, for a Personal Services Contractor Personnel and Operations Assistant, has been designated as a "tandem, ladder" position, starting at the entry level GS-7 or GS-9 salary range level (salary range: $42,209 - $67,114 per year), depending on the qualifications of the applicant. If starting at the GS-7 salary range, the individual will work pursuant to the statement of work set forth in the contract for the established entry level position for a minimum period of 12 months. After 12 months of performance, the PSC may be considered for promotion to the GS-9 level subject to completion of the annual performance evaluation by the supervisor.

Similarly, applicants who apply for only the GS-7 position even though they might meet the minimum qualifications for the GS-9 position will not be considered for the higher graded position if they have not submitted a separate application for that position. Applicants who are unsure of which grade level they meet the minimum qualifications should submit a separate application for each grade level.</p>
<p><br />6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 2 years, with three one-year option periods. OTI reserves the right to offer a contract for a period of fewer than five years, where deemed appropriate. There will be an initial probationary period of three months.</p>
<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Washington, DC</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>DCHA/OTI is an exciting, fast-paced, operational office in USAID. Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that OTI PSC staff is deployed expeditiously and programs started quickly, often with little or no lead time. This is a key position in a busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations. It is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support. To achieve this, OTI requires a Personnel and Operations Assistant who has the capacity to work well within a team environment and anticipate the needs of a complex organizational unit.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Personnel and Operations Assistant works closely with the Personnel and Operations Specialist and other members of the Operations and Management Division (OMD) as well as the OTI Country Program teams to ensure program-funded personnel are hired, tracked, and supported.</p>

Failure to provide the required information and/or materials will result in your not being considered for employment.</p>
<p>All applicants must submit complete dates (months/years) and hours per week for all positions listed on the OF-612 or on supplemental OF-612 continuation sheets to allow for adequate evaluation of your direct and related experience.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC>The Weapons and Capabilities Division (RD-CXW) of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is soliciting government, industry, and academia for high quality and innovative advanced technologies relevant to the development of a Robotic Underground Munition (RUM).&nbsp; The RUM would be a one-time use, air-delivered, highly mobile vehicle having certain characteristics similar to an unmanned ground vehicle.<br /><br />Besides relevant advanced technologies, RD-CXW is also seeking interested sources capable of performing as the weapon development prime and able to integrate technologies and produce and demonstrate a prototype robotic munition.<br /><br />The following technology development objectives relate to key RUM technologies that could benefit from near-term technology development and demonstration:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Survivable underground communication system.<br />2.&nbsp; Capabilities to efficiently overcome natural and man-made obstacles.<br />3.&nbsp; Robust sensors and perception.<br /><br />Other technologies necessary to produce a viable RUM are assessed to be at a higher technology readiness level (TRL) or would better profit from further development at a later date or by the weapon developer.&nbsp; As such, a potential prime's knowledge or capabilities in these areas is desired.&nbsp; These include:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Payload and fuzing development, integration and demonstration.&nbsp; The payload must be compatible with inflight and ground environments including long term storage under adverse temperature conditions, as well as all DoD insensitive munitions and other safety requirements.<br />2.&nbsp; Viable passive and active defensive and offensive systems.<br />3.&nbsp; Autonomous underground controls and navigation.<br />4.&nbsp; Vehicle control logic to avoid, traverse, neutralize or defeat natural and man-made obstacles.<br />5.&nbsp; Safe separation and accurate soft landing form an aircraft.<br /><br />Potential sources (either along or with appropriate teaming partners)&nbsp;interested in performing as the RUM weapon development prime must have expertise and capability in all of the following areas:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Robotic vehicle design and manufacture<br />2.&nbsp; Sensor integration and autonomous controls<br />3.&nbsp; Munition design and manufacture<br />4.&nbsp; Aircraft integration<br />5.&nbsp; Mission planning<br /><br />Responders to the RFI may choose to address any or all of the listed technology objectives, any or all of the listed technology objectives and the RUM development prime, or just the RUM development prime.&nbsp; Approaches that require significant basic or applied research (i.e. RDT&amp;E categories 6.1 and 6.2) are not desired.&nbsp; Responders with a SECRET or higher facility clearance may contact the DTRA Contracting Officer, Ms. Gretchen Clohessy, at <a href="mailto:RUM@dtra.mil">RUM@dtra.mil</a> for more detailed RUM performance goals.&nbsp; <br /><br />Responses shall be limited to no more than 20 pages, not including cover letter, cover page, and table of contents.&nbsp; Each response may address one, or multiple, technology objectives.&nbsp; In addition, responses should include, but are not limited to, the following:&nbsp; (a) technology concept(s) and associated performance, cost, and risk parameters; (b) respondent's stated assumptions;

<DESC>QUESTION

I'm somewhat  confused with Solicitation AG-0262-S-10-0026, Cascade Stocking Exam.  In the description of work it says there will be no electronic data required, data will be submitted on paper forms.  In the deliverables it states that data must be in an electronic format.  Which is correct?  Would it be acceptable if we wanted to use data recorders and submit electronic data?

ANSWER

We are looking for all the data submitted in paper/hard copy form.  We will work with the contractor if he/she wants so submit Item 3 data in electronic form but we are not requiring it and prefer it on paper.  Also all data from Items 1 and 2 will need to be on the forms provided by the government.  I guess I should have been more clear, my apologies for the confusion.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.
0001 Amendment should read:
The original synopsis for N00164-10-R-JQ59 posted on 26 April 2010 read as follows: "The CAP Laser shall be designed to be conforming to the grip on a Heckler & Koch 45 Compact (HK45C) pistol."
Is now being amended to read:"The CAP Laser shall conform to the HK45C grip, trigger guard, or forward rail mount. The features of the CAP Laser shall conform to the shape and interface of the HK45C as best as possible. If the trigger guard or rail mount option is pursued, the housing shall not exceed the width of the HK45C."
This action is to procure the Combat Assault Pistol (CAP) Laser.  The acquisition will be competitive and the product is a commercial item and will be procured IAW FAR part 12 and 13.5. This acquisition will follow a two phase approach; a best value approach for evaluating offeror's proposals under the Phase One evaluation, as well as evaluation of the awardee(s) pre-production systems under the Phase Two evaluation.  The Government intends to procure CAP Laser pre-production and production units that meet the requirements outlined in the performance specification PS/10/JXQR/083.  The Government may procure CAP Laser pre-production and production units that exceed the requirements cited in the performance specification and solicitation/contract by using a best value approach.  This endeavor will culminate in the award of one or multiple Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with a minimum of 2 and maximum of 1,500.  A maximum of three (3) contracts will be awarded on this effort. If multiple contracts are awarded, the outcome of the Phase Two evaluations shall result in down-selecting to one vendor for the purchase of all production units under this procurement, predicated upon at least one offeror submitting acceptable pre-production units.
The CAP Laser shall be designed to be conforming to the grip on a Heckler & Koch 45 Compact (HK45C) pistol.  It shall not interfere with the operation of the pistol or require a special holster. It shall provide an Infrared (IR) aiming laser that shall be visible on target with image intensification devices at 10 yards.  This will provide an aiming point for an operator that is wearing image intensification device.  The laser shall be classified as Class 1 per the ANSI standard. The CAP Laser will be used for target aiming during operational situations.  This requirement will be 100% set aside for small business and negotiated IAW FAR 19.5, Set-asides for Small Business. Interested parties can download the solicitation from the websites listed above.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed.
Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration database.  All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to FedBizOpps and NECO.  It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor FedBizOpps and NECO for amendments that may be issued to this solicitation.  For changes made after the closing date, only those offerors that provide a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.  
Interested sources must download from the www site listed and may contact Mr. Scott Miller, Code CXMMZK, at telephone 812-854-8288, Fax 812-854-5066 or e-mail: michael.s.miller11@navy.mil.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

NSN: 5962-01-437-7608   

ITEM DESCRIPTION:

HYBRID MICROCIRCUIT

SOURCE CONTROL 

Documentation of Traceability (Oct 2008)

    Products offered under this acquisition shall be
    in complete compliance with the item description
    on the schedule page and shall be new and
    unused, unless former Government surplus is
    evaluated and approved.

    If the offeror is not identified as an
    approved/qualified source in the item
    description, the offeror must submit
    traceability documentation to the Contracting
    Officer on or before the date that quotes/offers
    are due.  The documentation can be mailed, faxed
    or scanned and e-mailed.  The Contracting
    Officer may also require or consider additional
    evidence prior to award to establish the
    identity of the item and its manufacturing
    source. Failure to provide any required
    documentation within the stated timeframe may
    result in rejection of the offer.

    Traceability documentation must, at a minimum,
    include the following:

    (1) If the offeror is an authorized
    dealer/distributor for an approved/qualified
    source and for the specific item being procured:

    (a) The offeror must furnish one of the
    following: a copy of its current
    dealer/distributorship agreement, a letter of
    authorization from the approved/qualified
    source, or a link to the approved/qualified
    source's website which clearly identifies the
    offeror as an authorized dealer/distributor.

    (b) By providing this documentation, the offeror
    represents that the dealer/distributor
    relationship with the approved/qualified source
    applies to the item being procured. If the
    offeror's dealer/distributor status with the
    approved/qualified source changes either before
    or after award, the offeror will promptly notify
    the contracting officer.

    (2) If the offeror is not an authorized
    dealer/distributor for an approved/qualified
    source the offeror must provide the following:

    (a) If offered item(s) are "not in stock/not
    currently owned by the offeror" or "not yet
    manufactured":

    The offeror must furnish a verifiable quotation
    from the approved/qualified source to the
    offeror or from an authorized dealer/distributor
    to the offeror.  The quote must include the
    approved/qualified source's part number (or Mil
    Spec Type Designation), quantity sufficient to
    satisfy the solicitation requirement and date of
    quotation.  The quotation must either be on
    letter head from the approved/qualified source
    or an authorized dealer distributor to the
    offeror, or an electronic quote clearly
    identifiable as coming from the
    approved/qualified source or authorized
    dealer/distributor to the offeror.  If the
    products will be obtained from an authorized
    dealer/distributor, the information described in
    (1) must be provided to establish the authorized
    dealer/distributor arrangement.

    (b) If offered item(s) are "shipped" or "in
    stock/currently owned by the offeror", the
    offeror must furnish one of the following
    documents:

    (i) The invoice from the approved/qualified
    source or an authorized dealer/distributor to
    the offeror, or the packing slip which
    accompanied shipment from the approved/qualified
    source or authorized dealer/distributor to the
    offeror.  The document must be dated and include
    the following elements:  name and address of the
    approved/qualified source; the
    approved/qualified part number (or Mil Spec Type
    Designation); quantity sufficient to satisfy the
    solicitation requirement; and the offeror's name
    and address.  If the products were obtained from
    an authorized dealer/distributor, the
    information described in (1) must be provided to
    establish the authorized dealer/distributor
    arrangement.

    (ii) In addition, if MIL-M-38510, MIL-PRF-38534,
    MIL-PRF-38535, or MIL-PRF-19500 applies, the
    offeror must provide a copy of the Certificate
    of Conformance required by the
    specification.Note:  this does not alleviate the
    requirements in the DLAD clause 52.246-9042,
    Documentation of Traceability - QPL/QML
    Integrated Circuits, Hybrid Microcircuits, and
    Semiconductor Devices.


    (3) If the products to be furnished are not
    obtained directly from an approved/qualified
    source or an authorized dealer/distributor of an
    approved/qualified source, the offeror must
    provide the documentation described in (2)
    establishing the complete line of ownership or
    distribution from the approved/qualified source
    or an authorized dealer/distributor to the
    offeror.

    Notwithstanding any documentation provided prior
    to contract award, the Government reserves the
    right to require additional documentation
    attesting to the authenticity of the material at
    any time before or after contract delivery.

    If the solicitation indicates Inspection and
    Acceptance at Destination, the Government
    reserves the right to change to Inspection and
    Acceptance at Origin at time of award, and to
    incorporate DLAD clause 52.246-9004, Product
    Verification Testing.

<DESC>RECOVERY - A modification for $13,999,962 was issued to Danya International, Inc. against Task Order HHSP233201000303G. The modification is to exercise the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) portion of this task order since ARRA funding and non-ARRA funding cannot be co-mingled on the same action. Therefore, the ARRA portion of the work of the subject task order was separated out as an optional task that was exercised via a modification the same day the task order was awarded on April 28, 2010. This modification is being funded by ARRA funds. The task order was competitively awarded under FAR Part 8.4. This task order was awarded as Time and Materials because it is not possible, at the time of award, to estimate the extent of the work with any degree of confidence. The task order will specify fixed hourly rates and material costs and will include a ceiling price that the Contractor exceeds at its own risk.

<DESC>During the Pump #5 overhaul, the remaining four pumps must be kept operational.<BR>Before work can begin on Pump #5, stop gates must be installed and the intake chamber must be dewatered. Pump #5 required work includes separating the approximate 50-ton motor from the pump using the in-house crane, removing the damaged pump impeller from its shaft (requiring 400 tons of force), removing the shaft cover pipe, guide bearings, and miscellaneous other components. Said components shall be transported to a service center for cleaning, inspection, and complete evaluation. Damaged or worn parts shall be replaced or refurbished as appropriate. The 15,000 lb, 10 diameter. 4.5 high impeller is beyond repair and a new cast iron impeller must be fabricated and finish machined. Pump diffuser and discharge housing components, roughly 32 high and 10 in diameter, must be evaluated in-place for cracks, pitting and other damage. Cracked areas will be repaired using the metal stitching method and pitting by use of a metal repair product. All components shall be sandblasted prior to examination. Upon completion of repairs carbon metal components are to be coated with a coal-tar epoxy system. The motor and pump must be reassembled in a precisely aligned manner. The reassembled pump shall undergo dry and wet vibration and bearing temperature analysis and realigned at the contractors expense if the test results fall outside accepted criteria.<BR><BR>During the control gates refurbishing, one gate must remain functional at all times. These gates provide cooling water to the Dominion power plant. One gate is currently in the down position and the operator is non-functional. It requires refurbishment. The other gate is operational but the operator requires refurbishment of the gear boxes and drive gears.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because this is a task/delivery order where an exception to fair opportunity requirements was approved as this is a follow-on order to a competitive initial order (FAR 8.405-6(b)(2) or 16.505(b)(2)(iii).<br><br>Project Purpose<BR>The purpose of this pre-dredge sampling and analysis effort is to confirm the suitability of sediment to be dredged from the Oakland Inner Harbor Brooklyn Basin South Channel for upland placement, unconfined aquatic disposal at the San Francisco Deep Ocean Disposal Site (SFDODS) and at the SF-11 in-Bay site.  The Hamilton Wetland Restoration Project (HWRP) acceptance criteria will be used to evaluate the suitability for upland placement.<BR><BR>This pre-dredge sampling and analysis must be conducted according to the procedures and requirements in the Oakland Inner Harbor Brooklyn Basin South Channel, 2010 Maintenance Dredging, Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP) (USACE, March 2010), found in Appendix A of this SOW.<BR><BR>This SAP references the Master Sampling and Analysis Plan, USACE SF-District, O&M Dredging (USACE 2004), found in Appendix B of this SOW. <BR><BR>Project Description <BR>The contractor will plan, order supplies, schedule equipment and staff, and acquire needed site-specific information to conduct this sampling and analysis effort and shall provide an evaluation of the results. <BR>As described in the Appendix A SAP, this effort involves collecting cores at 52 locations.  Enough material shall be collected in order to conduct physical and chemical analysis of each core and then follow that up with physical, chemical and biological analysis of composites made from these cores.  For planning purposes, assume that each composite shall be made up from no less than 4 core locations.  The core locations are depicted in the SAP and the coordinates for the target core locations shall be provided by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).  The required sampling method is described in the SAP.  A portion of each core shall be frozen for future analysis and this is not to be confused with the sample archival procedures specified in the Master SAP.<BR><BR>Each of the 52 discrete samples shall be analyzed for physical and chemical parameters.  A preliminary report shall be prepared and submitted to convey this information.  The USACE will coordinate with regulatory agencies to develop the compositing scheme to be employed.  This first effort is time critical since biological analysis must begin within 8 weeks of the sample collection date.<BR><BR>Next the cores shall be composited and the full physical/chemical/biological analysis that is required by the SAP shall be conducted.  For estimating purposes, assume that there will be 12 composites to analyze.<BR><BR>Since dredge material from this channel may be beneficially reused at the HWRP, this current effort shall include analysis and evaluation based upon the requirements of the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) HWRP Biological Opinion (BO).  The HWRP BO constituents that are not in the Master SAP or have lower reporting limits than the Master SAP are identified in the Appendix A SAP.  All reporting limits must be achieved.<BR>All samples shall be handled and shipped according to the methods described in the Master SAP. <BR><BR>OPTION 1.  Without the availability of geotechnical information on the types of materials that are expected to be encountered from Station 93+100 to 112+00, the Contractor may encounter refusal above the proposed design depth and testing of the material that is required.  The Government may exercise this option  mobilize  a drill core barge to perform sampling in Merritt Sands.<BR><BR>OPTION 2.  To expedite the schedule due to eventual issues with EIS/EIR preparation, the Government may exercise the option for the A/E to prepare for a 7-day TAT<BR>

<DESC><p align="left">The purpose of the study is to evaluate the adequacy of the</p>
<p align="left">Warm Spring Dam Spillway and to determine the most likely downstream inundation area and</p>
<p align="left">flood depths in case of failure of the dam. The analysis shall determine the downstream</p>
<p align="left">inundation caused by both with and without failure analysis of the dam for the Probably</p>
<p align="left">Maximum Flood (PMF), as well as the 50-, 100-, 200-, and 500-year frequency based storms</p>
<p align="left">and a sunny day failure scenario. The study also includes mapping of the various failure</p>
<p align="left">analyses.</p>
<p align="left">The flood wave shall be routed from Warm Springs Dam, along Dry Creek to the</p>
<p align="left">Russian River to the Pacific Ocean. The District just completed a similar study for Coyote</p>
<p align="left">Valley Dam in July 2009. Coyote Valley Dam is also located in the Russian River watershed,</p>
<p align="left">upstream of Warm Springs Dam and Dry Creek. The Coyote Valley Dam study routed the</p>
<p align="left">flood wave from Coyote Valley Dam thru the Russian River to the Pacific Ocean. The</p>
<p align="left">hydraulic model used for the Russian River portion of the study has already been developed as</p>
<p align="left">part of the Coyote Valley Dam study and shall be used for this study for the Russian River reach</p>
<p align="left">between Dry Creek and the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p align="left">The same methodology for the Coyote Valley Dam study shall be used in this study.</p>
<p align="left">This report shall be made available to the contractor for review prior to the Fee Proposal due</p>
<p align="left">date. The study will include the use of existing GIS data, terrain model, flow data, high water</p>
<p align="left">marks, hydraulic and hydrologic models developed for the entirety of the Russian River</p>
<p align="left">watershed for the Coyote Valley Dam study.</p>
<p align="left">Additional data shall be provided to the contractor specific to Warm Springs Dam and</p>
<p align="left">Dry Creek. Additional cross section data is available for Dry Creek from the District office and</p>
<p align="left">shall be provided to the contractor. However, it will be necessary to develop additional channel</p>
<p align="left">data along Dry Creek based on FEMA profiles, site visit and older HEC-2/HEC-RAS</p>
<p align="left">geometries. The hydraulic models will be calibrated and validated to available historic data.</p>
<p align="left">Calibrated models will be used to model all of the events. Data specific to calibration of the</p>
<p align="left">models, such as high water marks, is limited and additional research will be necessary to</p>
<p>determine the availability and quality of such data.</p>

<AWARDEE>REES SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION;1007 WHITEHEAD ROAD EXT STE 1;TRENTON;NJ;086382405
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVALOTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONCalibration and Maintenance of Rees Scientific temperature monitoring system/equipment(1)  CONTRACTING ORGANIZATION:  Department of Veterans Affairs	Southern Arizona VA Health Care System 	(SAVAHCS) (678/9-90C) Tucson, AZ  85723.(2)  DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:  This Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) comes as a result of a current, on-going requirement at the Southern Arizona VA Health Care System (SAVAHCS) to validate and calibrate the existing wireless temperature tracking system on an annual basis.  Rees Scientific Corporation is the only vendor that can provide the proprietary components of the existing system that has been installed facility-wide.  These components include RF NET Buffs which convert wireless signals from a Rees Scientific input device and convert this signal to the digital format which sends the information to a Rees Scientific node.  The software, RF NET Buff, and node all utilize Rees Scientific proprietary software to compile the information from the inputs.  No other vendor can be utilized for this annual validation and calibration.     (3)  DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE:  (1) Provide The required wireless tracking system has been implemented facility-wide for the Pharmacy, Laboratory, and Nutrition & Food Service to remotely monitor all the refrigerators, freezers, and devices that have temperature requirements.  SAVAHCS Executive Management procured this system to enable the Community-Based Outpatient Clinics pharmaceutical refrigerators to also be monitored through connectivity to the hospital Information Technology network.  This system is robust and requires annual calibration and validation to ensure all the proprietary components are operating to standard.  The contractor is to provide all labor, travel and parts to provide all services as required during the normal business hours of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.   (4)  AUTHORITY:  The Statutory Authority permitting the above action is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), and the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   (5)  APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY:  Rees Scientific Corporation is the manufacturer of the monitoring system installed at SAVAHCS and produces the system to provide environmental controls through wireless temperature tracking systems currently installed at SAVAHCS.  There are no distributors that can provide the maintenance and all information provided is considered proprietary and confidential.  The system requires annual calibration to ensure they have update capabilities for the current demand of the hospital.  Services for maintenance of government owned systems are not available through FSS or any other contractor.(6)  EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION:  Currently, the above-proposed sole source manufacturer is the only firm that can satisfy the Governments requirement as supported by the lack of responses from the special notice announcements on FBO.gov.  The manufacturer has confirmed they do not outsource the calibration maintenance to other contractors.  Accordingly, all avenues to seek additional competition have been exhausted mandating the purchase directly from Rees Scientific Corporation for all services pertaining to the temperature monitoring system for SAVAHCS.  (7)  FAIR AND REASONABLE COST:  The temperature monitoring system calibration and maintenance service prices for this service have been provided by the contractor at the commercial market costs with a discount provided to the Veterans Administration.  The monitors are currently the property of SAVAHCS and will require ongoing calibration and maintenance service and support for the foreseeable future. (8)  MARKET SURVEY:  It has been found through market research that Rees Scientific Corporation is the only provider with the capability needed for this requirement due to SAVAHCS ownership of property.  The SAVAHCS Contracting Office will make attempts in the future to search for additional sources and ensure any new requirements are researched thoroughly prior to award.  (9)  SUPPORTING INFORMATION:   Rees Scientific Corporation is currently registered in Central Contractors Registration, does not show up on the Excluded Parties List and has a D&B Supplier Qualifier report of 3.  (10) OTHER SOURCES:  Rees Scientific Corporation is the single firm available to meet the needs for the requested service.(11) STEPS TO FOSTER COMPETITION:  The goal of the SAVAHCS is to provide the most efficient and affordable patient care throughout Southern Arizona.  The current monitoring and calibration system and equipment purchased from Rees Scientific Corporation is proven to be the only manufacturer that can provide the service requested to proprietary equipment.  Accordingly, there are no existing plans by the SAVAHCS to remove the current equipment from inventory and replace with new.
