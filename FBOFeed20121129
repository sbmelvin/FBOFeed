<DESC>The 746 Test Squadron (746 TS) Holloman AFB, NM is contemplating a sole-source firm-fixed-price contract to TMC Corporation, 4325 Del Rey Blvd, Las Cruces, NM 88012-8347. The purpose of this effort is to fabricate, integrate and deliver Non-GPS-Based Positioning System's (NGBPS) solar, generator and firm powered systems for us on White Sands Missile Range. These systems will enclose LocataLites, Part Number: ASY:01007-1 and Locata RX4, Part Number ASY:01008-1 firmware, software, and signals. The Locata units have been purchased under a previous contract and will be furnished by the Government.<br /><br />The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.<br /><br />The anticipated award date is September 2012. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code for this effort is 334220; size standard in number of employees is 750.<br /><br />The principle objective of this contract effort is to fabricate enclosures which integrate Locata part numbers ASY:01007-1 and ASY:01008-1. Each station is comprised of an environmentally secure, ruggedized enclosure that is temperature enclosed, maintenance friendly, and has the following characteristics/components: Locata transceivers, amplifiers, meteorological collection devices, power converters/sources, and other equipment required to amplify the signal and communicate with Locata rovers and transceivers. Enclosures will be durable enough to support both transmit and receive antennas, masts and their structures, able to connect to prime, solar or generator power (12 to 24 VDC), provide protection for the weather elements, but maintain an internal environment between 5% to 100% humidity and temperatures between 0 and 130 degrees F. Each sight must be able to remotely power on/off, and transmit system health and test data back to the master station and synchronize all network ground transceiver transmitters. Each element must be integrated and will operate as a system. Multiple systems will operate together as a network.<br /><br />TMC Corporation possesses&nbsp; the unique skills, expertise, and has extensive experience to perform the required fabrication of enclosures&nbsp;for integration and installation of the Government owned components and power and placement requirements for the requested enclosures.<br /><br />An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Manager or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.

EMS is defined in general, as the "monitoring of power consumption (advanced metering/sub metering) and the monitoring and controlling of the environmental parameters associated with a building HVAC system". The EMS solution is to provide the capability to monitor and control HVAC systems across the USPS portfolio. Existing building control systems range in complexity from very simple to sophisticate. Even though it is not the intent of the USPS to replace existing functional building controls which are deemed "sophisticated" if an evaluation determines a replacement/upgrade is a better value then the USPS will take the recommendation into consideration. The proposed solution must be robust and flexible so to accommodate possible building control scenarios such as:<br /></span><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK4"><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK3"><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK2"><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK1"><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK5"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Arial"><span>1.)<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Facilities with only manual controls - In this scenario the EMS shall have intelligent controllers which replace manual controls and provides real-time capabilities that monitor, control, store, and transmit facility energy consumption and operational data over the internet. <br /></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK4"><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK3"><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK2"><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK1"><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK5"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Arial"><span>2.)<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Facilities with existing building controls - In this scenario the solution shall integrate with existing HVAC systems unless replacement/upgrade of existing system is a better value to the USPS.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS PROCUREMENT WILL BE SOLICITED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS. SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOADING UNTIL APPROXIMATELY 17 DECEMBER 2012.

This is a one step design/bid/build construction project that will construct a two-story fitness center at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti (CLDJ), Africa.  The building is a pre-engineered metal building on reinforced concrete slab and foundations with insulated metal wall and roof panels, translucent wall panels, hydraulic elevator, interior concrete partitions, metal stud and gypsum board partitions, interior finishes, fire alarm and sprinkler system, plumbing, mechanical, electrical and incidental related work.
 Scope requirements include site preparation necessary for the construction of the fitness center also requiring installation of 75 new Containerized Living Units (CLUs), relocation of 75 existing CLUs encumbering the site, and replacing the artificial turf on the existing athletic field. Once the 75 new CLUs are constructed then the occupants of G-Block CLUs can relocate thus allowing those CLUs to be moved, triple stacked, and retrofitted with fire alarm and sprinkler systems. 
Other scope requirements include the demolition of the existing fitness center after the new facility is constructed.
The period of performance is approximately 18 months after notice to proceed.

This project will be awarded as a firm-fixed price contract.
 The Government reserves the right to enter into negotiations or limit the competitive range. The construction range is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000. 

This contract will require a Performance Bond pursuant to FAR 52.228-15, through an approved surety under the United States Treasury Department Circular 570.

The solicitation will be formatted as an RFP in accordance with the requirements designated by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.203 for a negotiated procurement utilizing procedures of FAR 36.2.
 This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerorsâ€™ proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.

The technical evaluation factors are anticipated to be as follows: Experience, Past Performance, Safety, and Schedule.

 This will be the normal method for distributing amendments; therefore, it is the offerorsâ€™ responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to this solicitation.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research, Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and Combating Terrorism S&amp;T Department (ONR 30) is soliciting white papers and proposals for both Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development.
<p>The overall goal of this solicitation is to foster new developments in Science and Technology which may ultimately lead to future operational capabilities beyond those represented by current acquisition programs and requirements. As such, it is anticipated that successful proposals would ultimately contribute to the scientific and technological underpinning from which future Naval Expeditionary and Combating Terrorism warfighting requirements and capabilities may become possible.</p>
<p>By necessity, the Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development efforts are extremely technically diverse. As such, efforts are divided into nine Thrust Areas each representing operational functions critical to Expeditionary Warfare. Each white paper and proposal must address only ONE Thrust Area; however, offerors may respond, via separate proposals, to multiple Thrust Areas, if desired. Background information and specific areas of interest for new contracts or grants are described below for each Thrust Area. Mention of specific systems or programs in the background sections of this BAA is solely for the purposes of informing potential offerors of existing or evolving state-of-the-art technology.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), Federal Protective Service Acquisition Division intends to make multiple awards under an unrestricted competition as a result of this solicitation covering unexpected and unanticipated protective security officer services (e.g. new sites without existing protective security officers, special events or to fulfill other contingencies, etc.) in Maryland, Washington, DC, and Virginia over the next three years. Under this contract vehicle, protective security officer services, conforming to all requirements of the resultant solicitation, will typically be required in 10 days or less - sometimes as little as several hours. Sites may require top secret or secret security clearances depending on the requirements at the task order level. All offerors will be required to have a Top Secret facility clearance at the time of proposal submission. It is the Government's intention to issue up to three (3) labor hour, indefinite quantity, indefinite delivery type contracts during which separate task orders for projects will be placed in accordance with FAR 16.505 as requirements, if any, develop. Contractors are required to quote on every task order issued under this contract vehicle and to be able to fully staff all requirements. Each contract will consist of a one year base ordering period and two, one year optional ordering periods.<br /><br />As an integral component of the FPS security effort, the contractor shall provide and maintain all management, supervision, manpower, training, equipment, supplies, licenses, permits, certificates, insurance, pre-employment screenings, reports, and files necessary to accomplish protective security officer services at these locations.<br /><br />This requirement is being solicited as a commercial service acquisition in accordance with FAR Part 12. The NAICS code is 561612, Security Guard and Patrol Services. The size standard is $18.5 million.<br /><br />The RFP shall require the submission of a technical proposal as well as a price proposal. It is anticipated that the solicitation, RFP # HSHQEC-13-R-00005, will be released to the Federal Business Opportunities website on or about December 10, 2012. A pre-proposal conference will be conducted on or about December 19, 2012, but will be confirmed after issuance of the solicitation. It is the contractor's responsibility to monitor the website for the issuance of the RFP as well as any updates to the solicitation. All contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) (https://www.sam.gov) prior to their submittal of a proposal.<br /><br />For questions regarding this announcement, please contact Kristin Blackmore who can be reached at 215-521-2291 or via e-mail Kristin.Blackmore@dhs.gov.<br /><br />The FedBizOpps staff is not authorized to determine the classification code for any FedBizOpps notice. Because a misclassified contract action fails to notify the firms most likely to respond and therefore may violate the Competition in Contracting Act, the contracting officer is held responsible for correctly classifying a FedBizOpps notice. A misclassified contract action must be corrected and re-synopsized in the FedBizOpps. Detailed classification codes are available on the FedBizOpps website at: http://www.FedBizOpps.gov/.

<DESC>Description: The following work will be performed at the Federal Building and US Courthouse, 200 W. Second Street Dayton, OH, the Federal Parking Lot, Third and Perry Streets Dayton, OH, and National Archives and Records Center, 3150 Springboro Road Dayton, OH.
<p>Project Summary Description: The contractor shall provide the management, supervision, manpower, equipment and supplies necessary to provide landscaping services as described herein. The Contractor shall be responsible for performing all work under this contract in accordance with all Federal, State, County, City laws and codes, and follow the more stringent of them. In addition to compliance with these laws, the Contractor shall follow all applicable standard industry practices including, but not limited to: Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA). If you are an Ability One Program (formerly the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Program) contractor, please include any Ability One requirements in your offer.</p>
<p>After award, the successful offeror will be given a written Notice to Proceed, and shall provide contractual services for a 12 month period commencing on the day specified in the Notice to Proceed. Work under this contract is expected to commence on or about April 1, 2013. The Government shall have the unilateral option of extending the term of this contract for 4 consecutive additional periods of 12 months each.<br />(a) All work shall be performed between the hours of 7:30 AM and 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday, Federal holidays excluded, unless specifically approved or requested by the COR. At the discretion of the COR, certain tasks such as mowing the lawn may be asked to be done during a certain time frame within the hours stated above. Landscaping maintenance will be performed during the calendar year on a cycle approved by the COR to maintain the inside and outside area in a neat and clean manner. Policing landscape areas to remove trash and other cleaning issues will be done by the landscaping contractor and Janitorial staff.</p>
<p><br />Basic Landscaping Maintenance includes mowing lawns, aerating lawns, power raking, edging, mulching, pruning, watering, weed, pest and disease control, plant maintenance, and replacement. In compliance with EPA and USDA requirements, compost and fertilizers made from recovered organic materials and biobased herbicides and pesticides will be used unless an alternative product is approved by the COR. The Contractor shall be held liable for any damage to grounds, vegetation, or landscaping due to his negligence and shall promptly report any theft or missing plants to the COR. The COR will determine if the plants are covered under the one year/season guarantee or if the government will order the replacement under additional services. The contractor is responsible for watering landscaped areas as needed (see Section C7 for availability of water connections and irrigation systems). If weed, pest or disease control is needed the COR will approve in advance their application. Planters will be well maintained and free of weeds and trash.</p>
<p>Walkways, landings, and steps will be free of trash and weeds. Shrubbery, trees and other landscaping will be pruned to maintain a well groomed appearance and be free of deadwood, suckers, litter and weeds. Fence areas, turf areas, sidewalks, gutters, roadways and other surfaces included in the maintenance area shall be free of leaves, litter and other debris. Plant material around fences, flagpoles, walls, walkways, parking lots and other property appurtenances will be trimmed to maintain a well groomed appearance.</p>
<p>Lawns will be well maintained and free of weeds, leaves, and trash. Soil shall be aerated by mechanical methods of piercing the ground to provide an adequate air supply to the soil and promote sustained plant life at least once per year.

<CONTACT>Jina M Jackson, Contracting Officer, Phone 2023540123, Fax 2027560134, Email jina.jackson@usmint.treas.gov
<DESC>Belt Annealing Furnace - San Francisco Mint
<p><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The United States Mint is seeking Sources interested in providing a new belt annealing furnace to the Mint's facility at San Francisco.</p>
<p>The United States Mint at San Francisco produces clad and silver proof coin sets at its facility. San Francisco presently has two belt annealing furnaces used to anneal over 20 million proof clad and silver coining blanks annually. These two mesh belt annealing furnaces are electrically heated units with atmosphere controlled muffle heating chambers. The oldest of the belt furnaces is scheduled to be replaced.</p>
<p>The existing proof coin process starts with the annealing of coin blanks in a belt annealing furnace. Hard clad coin blanks are supplied by the Denver Mint. Silver blanks (90% silver:10% copper) are supplied by vendors. Nickels, clad and silver dimes, clad and silver quarters, clad and silver half dollars and clad dollar blanks are annealed on the belt annealing furnaces at temperatures ranging from 1050&deg; F to 1550 &deg; F depending on the alloy. One denomination at a time is run through the belt annealing furnace and each denomination requires a new set up. Annealed blanks are stored and used in the production cycle when needed. The belt annealing furnace provides a non-oxidizing or reducing gas atmosphere consisting of approximately 96% nitrogen and 4% hydrogen at low dew points to help prevent blank oxidation. Following annealing, the blanks are cooled down in a cooling section of the furnace to a temperature of 105&deg;F or less to prevent oxidation and facilitate handling.</p>
<p>Annealed coin blanks are fed into one of six burnishing lines where the blanks are cleaned, polished and dried. Following burnishing, blanks are washed, lubricated and buffed and are then ready to be struck into proof coins in the press room. Following striking on coining presses, the finished coins are packaged for shipment.</p>
<p>Information on the United States Mint and proof coins can be seen on the United States Mint website at www.usmint.gov.</p>
<p>ALTERNATIVE DESIGNS UNDER CONSIDERATION<br />The Mint is considering three alternatives to meet the requirement for replacing the existing belt annealing furnace. All three alternatives must provide annealing capacity of 136 kg per hour and fit into the existing space occupied by one of the current annexing furnace located on the 2nd floor of the San Francisco Mint in the material treatment room.<br />Alternative #1<br />A new belt annealing furnace with a capacity of 136 kg per hour (300 lbs/hour). The unit would have one belt.</p>
<p>Alternative #2</p>
<p>A new furnace with two separate belts and two independently controlled heating chambers with the capability of annealing two different blank denominations simultaneously. The capacity of each annealing chamber is 68 kg/hour (150 lbs/hr) for a total capacity of 136 kg/hr.</p>
<p>Alternative #3</p>
<p>Two new annealing furnaces each with a capacity of 68 kg/hour (150 lbs/hr). Each furnace would have the capability of running separate denominations. The total capacity of the two units would be 136 kg/hr.</p>
<p>NOTE: The Offeror shall address all three concepts.</p>
<p>ANNEALING FURNACE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>1. Annealed blanks must achieve hardness requirements listed in Table 1 and Table 2.<br />2. Annealed blanks must achieve a uniform grain size consistent with the grain size achieved with the belt annealing furnace. Maximum grain size in the clad layer is 0.035 mm and maximum grain size for the 90:10 silver is 0.030 mm.<br />3. The system must be automated to the greatest degree possible to minimize manually performed operator tasks.<br />4. Change over time from one denomination to another denomination shall be kept minimal. <br />5. Blanks above 105&deg;F require a protective, non-oxidizing (reducing) atmosphere to maintain the bright annealed blank surface and prevent personnel from being burned by touching the blanks. Preferred design is a muffle furnace where the muffle is constructed from a corrosion resistant metal.<br />6. Design precise measurement systems for blank temperature, dew point, oxygen level and dwell time in the continuous belt annealing system.<br />7. Available space for new furnace: length from wall to upsetting operation space 52 feet, width from building columns to aisle: 16 feet, ceiling height 10 feet<br />8. The United States Mint requires being able to anneal both rimmed (upset) and unrimmed blank types. The United States Mint currently rims golden dollar blanks before annealing but rims all other denominations after annealing. <br />9. The controls shall be PLC driven using an Allen Bradley control. The control monitor shall show all settings, all monitored readings such as temperature, moisture level (dew point), oxygen level, belt speeds, the production recipe being used, alarms when they are activated and the electric current flow to the furnace zones.<br />10. Operator input will be able to select a recipe which will define temperature in each zone and belt speed. The startup sequence must insure that the forming gas valve does not open until the oxygen level in the furnace has been reduced to below 1 % in accordance with the NFPA code.<br />11. Operating temperature: 1050 - 1550 degrees F normal with 1900&deg;F maximum. Preset via selected recipe and controlled automatically by an electronic controller to plus or minus 10 &deg;F. The temperature controller shall control the temperature at the blank surface.<br />12. Connected load: 150 kW maximum. Power supply: 480 volts, 3 phase, 60 hertz. The offeror shall provide the calculations on the specified throughput requirements to support the kW capacity in the proposal.<br />13. Atmosphere: The furnace atmosphere shall be approximately 95% nitrogen at minus 75&deg;F dew point and 5% hydrogen at minus 113&deg;F dew point. The new furnace shall operate from the existing plant gas atmosphere system. The new furnace shall maintain a dew point of minus 75&deg;F or less. <br />14. Conveyor speed: 0.5 to 19 inches per minute, continuously variable throughout the range, set by the recipe with supervisor adjustable override.<br />15. Cooling sections: The cooling sections shall be provided with closed loop refrigerated chilled water systems complete with coils and cooling jackets. The cooling rate of blanks should be greater than 3000 &deg;F per hour. The temperature of the blanks exiting the annealing furnace shall not exceed 105&deg;F.<br />16. The Offeror shall provide information on their proposed drive for the conveyor. <br />17. Belt Cleaning Mechanism: The Offeror shall describe the proposed belt cleaning mechanism. <br />18. Dew point and oxygen monitoring systems: A continuous monitoring system shall be provided to monitor the dew point of the atmosphere within the muffle through all sections of the furnace (heating and cooling zones). The incoming gas shall also be monitored. The proposal shall state the number of points and locations to be monitored and explain the reasoning for this recommendation. Dew points higher than desired shall activate an alarm on the control panel.<br />19. Heating - Cooling interface shield: The Offeror shall provide detail on their heat shield between the heating and cooling zones. <br />20. Atmosphere provisions: Furnace atmosphere blanket injection nozzles shall be provided at each end of the chamber as well as in each separate heat zone. The injector nozzles shall distribute gas evenly across the furnace width. Atmosphere sampling ports shall be at each independent heating zone (3 ports at each zone equally spaced across the furnace width), in the cooling zones as well as at each end. They shall not be located adjacent to the injector nozzles. All sampling ports shall be routed to a single location for monitoring equipment. <br />The Mint requires the capability to inject N2 gas only or the mixed 95% N2 plus 5% H2 gas in different sections of the furnace. The Offeror shall address the feasibility of such a system.<br />The Offeror shall provide a nitrogen purge of the conveyor belt at the end of the blank loading area to remove air trapped in the belt weave and prevent it from entering the furnace. <br />21. Instrumentation and Control Components: Furnace control shall be PC driven with a recipe and protected password with a manual override. Any manual control instrumentation, switches, gauges, etc shall be mounted on the face of the panel and clearly marked as to their function.<br />22. Other controls: The operator's station shall have the following controls and/or displays, as well as, any others the Offeror believes are desirable.</p>
<p>a. Kilowatt meter capable of displaying instantaneous, peak, and average readings;<br />b. Belt speed;<br />c. Furnace atmosphere with instant shutdown capabilities in the event of a power failure;<br />d. Main power and emergency power disconnect;<br />e. Blank feeding device;<br />f. Dew point monitor readout; and<br />g. Oxygen read out capable of parts per million (ppm) reading.</p>
<p>23. Blank feeder: The Offeror shall provide details on their proposed blank feeder. The blank feeder will automatically drop the blanks onto the belt in a straight row without touching the previous row. No overlap of blanks is allowed. Spacing between rows shall be 1/8 inch to &frac14; inch.<br />24. Combustibles analyzer system: The incoming plant atmosphere gas shall be monitored with a combustibles analyzer that will provide the level of combustibles in the gas. The system shall sound an alarm if the percentage reaches a predetermined level. The analyzer and installation shall be in accordance with NFPA code.<br />25. The blanks shall exit the furnace into a Mint provided conveyor. The handling of the blanks at the discharge shall not damage the blanks.<br />26. The Offeror shall provide details on their proposed exhaust hoods to capture the escaping atmosphere. The exhaust hoods shall connect to the Mint's existing exhaust ductwork.<br />QUALITY REQUIREMENTS<br />1. Annealed blanks must achieve hardness requirements listed in Table 1 and Table 2.<br />2. Annealed blanks must achieve a uniform grain size consistent with the grain size achieved with the existing belt annealing furnaces.

At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers.

(b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number.

Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs.

It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section. <BR> <BR>(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information.

Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List.

When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL DOCUMENT
 FOR A LIMITED SOURCE AWARD 

1.  	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
Office of Acquisition and Operations
      Technology Acquisition Center
      260 Industrial Way West
      Eatontown, New Jersey 07724
         
2.   Description of Action: This proposed sole source action is for a Firm-Fixed Price contract through December 31, 2012 for local exchange carrier (LEC) services, henceforth referred to as telephone services, currently installed and used by the VA New York/New Jersey Veterans Healthcare Network including all community based outpatient clinic (CBOC's) and support facilities in Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 3, which is part of Region 4.  This action will contain three, one-month options to be exercised at the Government's discretion to continue providing seamless coverage in the event the regional contract award is further delayed.  The proposed source is Verizon Federal Inc., 22001 Loudon County Parkway, Ashburn, VA 20147. 

3.   Description of Supplies or Services: The purpose of this proposed action is to provide a bridge between the current contract providing VISN 3 telephone services and the follow on effort which is being solicited on FedBizOpps (FBO) under full and open competition.  The telephone services Contractor must provide transmission facilities, equipment, materials, maintenance, test equipment, and design layout needed to perform and provide local access and transport services and functions for the New York/New Jersey VISN 3 Network.  This includes any special items, equipment, wiring or infrastructure to ensure the Contractor's solution is compatible with the Government's infrastructure.  The Contractor is responsible for troubleshooting and maintaining the operation of the circuit up to its termination point.  Access to the local exchange shall include: operator assistance, directory assistance (DA), and emergency 911/E911 services and functions.  

4.   Statutory Authority: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 8.405-6(a)(2). 

5.   Reason for Authority Cited:  Telephone services to VISN 03 are currently provided by Verizon.  In May of 2012, VA identified the need to regionalize phone services for economies and efficiencies to reduce recurring costs.  A decision was made to solicit the requirement for all of Region 4 (to include VISN 3) on FBO under full and open competition with a forecast award date of 10/01/2012.  As requirements for the regional contract were developed to further promote competition, delays occurred which have pushed the first possible cutover date for the VISN 3 phones out three months to 01/01/2013.  VA needs to ensure phone service to all facilities including CBOC's and support facilities in VISN 3 is uninterrupted.  Local telephone exchange service is vital for VISN 3 to allow communications which enhance patient care as well as to facilitate emergency responses.  These facilities throughout VA New York/New Jersey provide direct patient care and cannot lose telecommunication services.  Any lapse in service will have a profoundly negative effect on VISN 3's telecommunication lifeline.  Transition from the existing provider to another vendor would take time and could not be complete by the need date; therefore a sole source bridge contract is required. 

6.   Efforts to Obtain Competition: VA technical experts surveyed the marketplace and found that competition for this bridge effort is not practical with the regional competition underway and under the current time constraints related to the expiration of the existing contract.  The regional requirement will be competed on FBO under full and open competition. 

7.   Actions to Increase Competition: At the present time, Technology Acquisition Center Austin is working on a solicitation for a competitive regional phone services contract that will encompass not only VISN 3, but all of VA Region 4's phone requirements to allow full and open competition on FBO; however the anticipated award date is not until 01/01/2013.  All future requirements will be transferred to this regional contract upon its award.  The proposed action will be synopsized on FBO.

8.   Market Research:  Market research indicated that the existing services are available from Verizon Federal Inc.

9.   Other Facts: This effort is purely a bridge contract to ensure no break in critical phone service to VISN 03 between the expiration of the current contract and the award of the fully competed regional contract.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is issuing this Sources Sought Notice as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support the program entitled "Measure and Instrument Development and Support (MIDS)." This program promotes the quality of healthcare by emphasizing major strategies for evaluating and improving care. Under multiple task orders, the contractors shall assist CMS in developing , testing, refining, revising, maintaining, implementing, and publically reporting quality healthcare-specific measures. <br /><br />The development and use of clinical quality measures remains a critical healthcare priority and the tool of choice for improving quality of care at the national, community and facility levels. The MIDS contract provides a vehicle to objectively evaluate and promote quality of care within the Federal quality reporting programs by aligning with the Measures Management Blueprint, a comprehensive and structured process for developing and maintaining evidence-based clinical quality measures.<br />The nature of highly technical work requires the expertise and services of qualified personnel, facilities, equipment, materials, and supplies not otherwise provided by the government, as needed to perform quality measurement program support activities. Development, revision, and/or maintenance of assessment instrument data items, data collection vehicles, and quality measures (and their corresponding manuals, public outreach and coordination of data elements and measures with other MIDS contractors) comprise the fundamental activities under the IDIQ contract. The MIDS Contractor is required to gather and analyze data and information relating to activities specified in the Task Order Statement of Work in the form of an environmental scan and empirical data analysis of all pertinent data/information sources.<br />Please refer to Appendix I and II for a sample description of services and potential task orders for this requirement.<br /><br />The contractor must be free of conflicts of interest or prepare an OCI mitigation plan to address any actual, potential or apparent organizational conflicts of interest that could arise if the contractor won the award. Organizational conflicts of interest can be broadly categorized into three groups: (1) -unequal access to information cases, (2) -impaired objectivity cases, and (3) -biased ground rules cases. Possible other conflicts of interests for a MIDS contractor may include any interest in the development of a measure that leads to a personal or organizational advantage that might therefore, in actuality or appearance, compromise the integrity of the measure.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Unequal Access to Information ("Unfair" access to non-public information) - Consists of situations in which a firm has access to nonpublic information (including proprietary information and non-public source-selection information) as part of its performance of a Government contract and that information may provide the firm with a competitive advantage in a later competition for a Government contract. In these "unequal access to information" cases, the concern is limited to the risk of the firm gaining an unfair competitive advantage; there is no issue of bias.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Biased Ground Rules Consists of situations in which a firm, as part of its performance of a Government contract, has helped (or is in a position to help) set the ground rules for another Government contract by, for example, writing the statement of work or the specifications, or establishing source-selection criteria. In these "biased ground rules" cases, the primary concern is that the firm could skew the competition, whether intentionally or not, in favor of itself and/or its affiliates. These situations may also involve a concern that the firm, by virtue of its special knowledge of the agency's future requirements, would have an unfair competitive advantage in the competition for those requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Impaired Objectivity Consists of situations where a firm has an interest (typically financial) that may conflict with the interest of the Government to whom the firm has a contractual obligation, and the firm's work under the Government contract could give the firm the opportunity to benefit its other business interests. If the firm is using subjective judgment or giving advice, and its other business interests could be affected by that judgment or advice, the firm's objectivity may be impaired. An example would be if the firm was evaluating itself, an affiliate or a competitor, either through an assessment of performance under another contract or an evaluation of proposals. In these "impaired objectivity" cases, the concern is that the firm's ability to render impartial advice to the Government could appear to be undermined by its relationship with the entity whose work product is being evaluated.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a pre-solicitation conference will take place and Request for Proposals will be issued in January, 2013. Contract awards are anticipated by June, 2013. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. The estimated period of performance for this requirement is a base year plus four one-year options. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541690. <br />THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.<br />CMS will evaluate market information to ascertain potential market capacity to 1) provide services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated; 2) secure and apply the full range of corporate financial, human capital, and technical resources required to successfully perform similar requirements; and 3) implement a successful project management plan that includes: compliance with tight program schedules; cost containment; meeting and tracking performance; hiring and retention of key personnel and risk mitigation.<br />Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions.</p>
<p><strong>Submission Instructions</strong>: <br />If your organization has the potential capacity to perform the services described in the appendices, please provide the following information: <br />1. Organization information including name, point of contact, address, website address, telephone number, size and type of ownership.<br />2. Based upon the NAICS code specified herein, indicate whether your firm is classified as a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business and whether the firm is U.S. or foreign owned.<br />3. Tailored capability statement addressing the particulars of this effort, with clear documentation supporting claims of organizational capability and staff qualifications and expertise. If subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, the documentation shall address the administrative, management, and communication structure of such arrangements in appropriate detail<br />4. Interested firms shall have strong knowledge, educational background, and documented expertise related to project management, quality measure development, specification and testing, instrument and tool development, maintenance and application, statistical analysis and modeling, consensus entity endorsement and federal policy and program implementation related to national healthcare strategies.<br />5. Please briefly discuss any potential conflicts that may preclude your company from performing any such work under this requirement.<br /><br />Submissions are to be delivered no later than December 20, 2012, 2:00 p.m. EST and shall be e-mailed to Kimberly Tatum at Kimberly.Tatum@cms.hhs.gov or Jonathon Chattler at Jonathon.Chattler@cms.hhs.gov. Submissions received after this date and time may not be included as part of the market research analysis.</p>

<a href="mailto:James.M.Hillman@nasa.gov">James M. Hillman</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/DFRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for REPAIR MISSION CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURES (RMCI). This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement-market survey for information only that will be used for preliminary acquisition planning purposes.  No proposals are being requested or accepted at this time.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC), is seeking capability statements from all interested parties (nationwide), including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses,  and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for revitalization of a fifty-five (55) year old building complex by upgrading, replacing, or demolishing deteriorating and inefficient mechanical systems that have become too unreliable and costly to maintain.  The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto. The proposed project will be a Firm Fixed Price construction contract.	The type of solicitation to be issued will depend upon the responses received to this synopsis.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or for any follow up information requests.  Please note that a decision to set-aside this procurement or to compete it through full and open competition has not yet been made. Project Background - The B4800 complex is the Heart of DFRC and houses; Mission Control Rooms, Western Aeronautical Test Range (WATR) data hubs, Telemetry & Radar Acquisition Processing Systems (TRAPS), and mission critical labs and support offices.  The B4800 complex also houses the Centers leadership and the largest percentage of DFRC's workforce.  The complex is comprised of three (3) buildings: B4800, B4801, and B4802. Building B4800 is at the center of the complex and has undergone eleven (11) major renovations.  Buildings B4801 and B4802 are essentially active aircraft hangars attached to the East and West sides of building B4800.  The mechanical systems of all three (3) buildings are interconnected, and therefore function as only one (1) building from a mechanical systems standpoint.	However, from an architectural standpoint, the three (3) buildings can be individually identified.  Space volumes, roof configurations, and general conditions are quite different between the buildings.  While building B4800 has an array of flat roofs at different elevations, building B4802 to the West of B4800, is basically an active aircraft hangar with a standing seam metal roof in good condition, and building B4801 to the East of building B4800, is also an active aircraft hangar with a mezzanine, some support offices, storage areas, and a parabolic roof currently under repair. The general scope of the project is as follows: 1) Replace existing twin 400 ton chillers in Fanhouse 1A with a high efficiency oil-free magnetic bearing centrifugal chiller.  The all variable speed central plant will be fully optimized using the Kiltech Central Plant Energy Control System (CPECS), or approved equal, selected platform to be fully integrated into a Siemens Building Controls System. Chilled water service shall not be interrupted during construction.  A temporary Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) service plan shall be submitted for the Government's prior approval. 2) Install automated chemical water treatment system. 3) Install new chilled water pump system for Fanhouse 1A. 4) Upgrade the existing Siemens equipment controls in buildings B4800, B4801, and B4802. 5) Replace pneumatic operated ventilation air dampers for Fanhouses 1, 2, 3, 8A, and 8B. 6) Upgrade Fanhouse 1A cooling tower fan motors. 7) Replace the existing Fanhouse 1A cooling tower condenser water pumps. 8) Demolish the existing chilled water system in Fanhouse 6. 9) Replace Fanhouse 7A multi-deck Air Handling Unit (AHU) which services the Blue and Gold rooms of the Mission Control Complex (MCC).  Chilled water service shall not be interrupted at any time during construction.  A temporary HVAC service plan shall be submitted for the Government's prior approval. 10) Replace Direct Expansion (DX) unit serving Lab 2404 and incorporate it into the chilled water system. 11) Replace 5 ton DX unit serving Room 3302 and incorporate it into the chilled water system. 12) Replace 25 ton DX unit serving the old Long Range Optics (LRO) area and incorporate it into the chilled water system. 13) Replace HVAC system serving the 4801 mezzanine conference room area with 6 zones, new Variable Air Volume (VAV) with hot water reheat, and new Direct Digital Control (DDC) controls. 14) Provide new 3 capped chilled water supply and return stub with valving for future expansion. 15) Replace 6 ton (AHU) serving Room 3303. 16) Provide refrigerant monitoring system for Fanhouse 1A. 17) Provide an energy management system for the central plant. 18) Replace the HVAC system serving the video teleconference room in building B4801. 19) Replace HVAC system (7a AHU 2) and install new VAVs and DDC controls. Other procurement information: Order of Magnitude for the acquisition is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. Duration of project is approximately 500 calendar days after NoticeTo-Proceed (NTP). North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this acquisition is 238220 with a small business size standard of $14.0 Million dollars in average annual receipts. Under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guidelines, if this action is set-aside for small business concerns, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 15% of the contract work with his/her own employees. Prior Government contract work is not required for submitting a response under this sources sought synopsis. Interested parties shall submit the following information in their capability statements: 1) Business name and address, cage code, DUNS number, size of business (large or small), socioeconomic classification, if applicable, (HUBZone, 8(a) include graduation date, Veteran-Owned, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Woman-Owned) including a copy of the certificate issued by the SBA, average annual revenue for the last three (3) years and number of employees; ownership; number of years in business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed); 2) Clear evidence of the firm's current experience (within the last five (5) years) performing work of a similar type, scope, and in remote areas.	The experience should be identified by: list of customers, contract numbers, agency issuing the contract, contract type, project titles, dollar values, and points of contact (both contractor and customer) with CURRENT and VERIFIED telephone numbers, email addresses, etc.  Indicate if the firm was a prime or subcontractor (if subcontractor on the project, provide prime contractor information).  Description of items/services provided under the contract.  If your firm has never contracted with the Federal Government as a prime contractor, or as a subcontractor to a prime Federal contractor, provide a description of construction services provided to commercial sources. Include attachments documenting the company's equipment assets, personnel skill levels, and financial resources that demonstrate the company's responsibility and capability to perform the required work; 4) A affirmative statement of intention to submit an offer for the solicitation (if issued) as a prime contractor; 5) Statement of bonding capacity (the project will require 100% performance and payment bonds on the final amount of the project awarded); 6) Has your firm ever been terminated for cause or default from a contractual arrangement, whether Federal or private sector, as a result of failure to perform, poor quality and workmanship provided, etc.?  If so, please provide the specifics; 7) Has your firm, or any firm that you would potentially joint venture or team with, ever bid on a Federal acquisition and had been determined non-responsible by the contracting officer or has the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) ever failed to issue a Certificate of Competency (COC) to your firm or teaming partners when the matter was referred to SBA for review and consideration?  If so, please provide the specifics. Firms are reminded of the requirement to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, as required by FAR 4.1102, and of the submission of Annual Representations and Certifications as required by FAR 4.1201.  (See "https://acquisition.gov    " for on-line registration). Interested parties are encouraged to respond to this sources sought synopsis not later than 21DEC12.

<p>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing laser diode systems.</p>
<p>The Electron Physics Group in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology at NIST requires laser diode systems to perform research on high brightness ion sources for focused ion beam applications based on laser cooling. This research supports the CNST's mission to develop new measurement tools that enable critical applications of nanotechnology in the Nation's economy. Diode laser systems provide a very cost effective means to produce the required laser power with the necessary continuous wave (CW) stability, narrow linewidth and tunability to both laser cool atoms and ions and also ionize cold atoms. The proposed acquisition will enable new developments in barium ion sources and cesium ion sources.</p>
<p>The laser diode systems will be used in laser cooling and ionization of cold atoms. High power is required because the laser light will be frequency-doubled in existing systems that require high power for good efficiency. The linewidth and stability of the lasers are essential for fine frequency control of the cooling laser light and long-term reliable operation. An integrated system with a small footprint is necessary to meet space constraints of the experimental apparatus. Computer control is also required to enable full flexibility of operation.</p>
<p>NIST requires a tunable diode laser system that operates in continuous wave (CW) mode for use in laser-cooling of barium ions. In particular, NIST requires a master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) consisting of a tunable, single-frequency external cavity diode laser (ECDL) that is amplified by a tapered amplifier (TA) diode laser.</p>
<p><br />The specified laser system is essentially identical in all aspects except for wavelength and output power to an existing laser system in the NIST laboratory purchased from Toptica Photonics (TA PRO 850 HP) in 2012. It is essential that the new laser system match the existing equipment. The system is modular in construction and it will be necessary to exchange modules between laser systems during the course of operation. CNST is a multi-user facility in which this equipment is used on a daily basis. This laser diode system will be the primary backup. Should one system fail, the redundancy of having two identical systems such that parts can be exchanged is essential to continued operations and meeting the agency's goals in a timely manner.</p>
<p>The system shall be capable of:</p>
<p>1. Minimum Specifications</p>
<p>a. Wavelength range: 980 nm to 988 nm<br />b. Output power @987 nm: &gt;2000 mW, measured before output isolator<br />c. Linewidth (over 5us): &lt;150 kHz<br />d. ASE background: &lt; -40 dB<br />e. Mode-Hop-Free Tuning Range: &gt; 40 GHz<br />f. Output mode M^2 &lt; 1.5<br />g. Optical Isolation between ECDL and TA: 60 dB<br />h. Output Optical Isolation: 60 dB or greater with a transmission &gt;80%<br />i. ECDL tunable diode laser (master oscillator) and the tapered amplifier laser (power amplifier) integrated into a single laser head for maximum frequency stability and minimum linewidth<br />j. The system must include all electronics and cables necessary to run the laser with the above specifications<br />k. The system must include all software and hardware necessary for computer control of the laser via USB interface. At a minimum, the following controls must be present via computer:</p>
<p>i. Diode current<br />ii. ECDL grating piezo voltage<br />iii. Laser frequency modulation with at least 20 MHz bandwidth<br />iv. Frequency stabilization based on saturated absorption spectroscopy signal provided by user with the following features:</p>
<p>1. "Side-of-fringe" and "top-of-fringe" frequency stabilization options<br />2. Dual channel PID control for feedback to diode current and ECDL grating voltage<br />3. Automatic locking and relocking to selected feature in spectroscopy signal<br />4. Measurement and display of error signal spectrum</p>
<p>l. Warranty: 3000 hours or 1 year, whichever comes first<br />m. Acceptance period: 4 weeks after delivery of entire system</p>
<p><br />After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the laser diode systems that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a contract. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socioeconomic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that manufacture such systems are requested to email product literature describing their capabilities to eric.bubar@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:<br /><br />1.

<p>2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address).</p>
<p>3. Budgetary info for a system that is capable of meeting the aforementioned specifications.</p>
<p>4. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems.</p>
<p>5. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to eric.bubar@nist.gov is currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s).<br /><br />6.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT: 55 CONS/LGCZ, Offutt AFB NE intends to award a sole source extension to Science Applications International Corporation, contract FA4600-05-C-0003, under authority 10 USC 2304(c )(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) provides that: For DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, "services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in (B) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements." The period of performance for the extension will be a three-month period of 1 Apr 2012 through 30 Jun 2013. The National Target Base (NTB)/National Desired Ground Zero (DGZ) List (NDL) Integrated Development System (NIDS II) is a subsystem of the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) supporting assigned Operational Plans (OPLANS), to include OPLAN 8044, Theater Planning, and Global Strike Support Documents, and new UCP tasking and related products through target selection and DGZ Construction capabilities. The Contractor shall (1) fulfill software engineering, hardware, integration, technical support, and training requirements of the ISPAN targeting function, including the areas of NTB Production and DGZ development, (2) provide software sustainment for NIDS II and incorporation of NDL Support Software (NDLSS) into NIDS II. This effort includes completion of Government-approve Software Change Requests (SCRs) for the NIDS II software applications and completion of SCRs to support Enterprise Database (EDB) cutovers. Additionally, the contractor will provide systems engineering services for future software development tasks, as they become relevant to the USSTRATCOM strategic mission.<br />The follow-on effort source selection will not be completed by the end of the current contract on 31 Mar 2013. Therefore, the Government intends a three month extension of the current contract (1 Apr 2012 through 30 Jun 2013) to allow time for completion of the follow-on source selection.<br />This notice is neither a request for a competitive proposal or a solicitation for offerors. A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.<br />

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
<p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1. The FHFA intends to negotiate a sole source award with NeighborWorks America, 1325 G Street, NW Suite 800, Washington, DC 20005 for the service of marketing to the NeighborWorks Training Institutes (NTI) participants related to issues and topics of interest to the affordable housing field, meeting and logistics planning, meeting/presentation and facilitation space at each NTI for the next three years (2013-2015).</p>
<p>FHFA has contracted with NeighborWorks America for the above services for the previous two years (2010-2012).</p>
<p>NeighborWorks&reg; America (NeighborWorks) is a national nonprofit organization chartered by Congress in 1978. NeighborWorks&reg; mission is to provide opportunities for Americans to live in affordable homes, improve their lives, and strengthen their communities. NeighborWorks strengthens communities across America using two primary strategies. First, they support innovative local partnerships of residents, businesses, and government, collectively known as the NeighborWorks network. The network currently includes 235 organizations serving more than 4,500 urban, suburban, and rural communities nationwide. The second strategy is to support thousands of affordable housing and community development non-profits and municipalities across America by providing training, tools, and community revitalization and stabilization programs. In fiscal year 2011, NeighborWorks provided training and technical assistance to more than 22,000 individuals from approximately 3,400 nonprofits and municipalities.</p>
<p>NeighborWorks' Congressional charter and governance structure assure that its goals, activities and operations are sound and suitably monitored through audits and an annual report to the President and Congress. NeighborWorks' Board of Directors is required by statute to consist of the heads or their statutorily designated representatives of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), Federal Reserve System, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). In addition to being represented on NeighborWorks' Board of Directors, the FDIC, Federal Reserve System and HUD have various sponsorship and service agreements with NeighborWorks.</p>
<p>NeighborWorks&reg; America is the nation's leader in providing affordable housing and community<br />development training to nonprofits and municipalities. The NeighborWorks Training Institute (NTI), held four times annually in different cities across the country, provides over 50 courses (most are multi-day courses) in eight different program areas; between 1, 700 and 2,100 practitioners attend each NTI. Using proven adult education methodology, NeighborWorks Training emphasizes practical competency-based instruction, combining lecture with case studies, site visits, small-group exercises, demonstrations, and other participatory methods. At each of its national training institutes, they hold a symposium on critical issues and innovative and cutting-edge strategies to the affordable housing and community development field.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. Interested persons may identify their interest and capacity by responding to this requirement in writing to the points of contacts designated herein.</p>
<p>Oral or telephonic inquiries will not be accepted. All interest and capability statements received within fifteen (15) calendar days after the date of this publication will be considered by the FHFA.</p>
<p>The FHFA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents. Based upon the responses to this notice, the Government retains sole discretion to award and not compete the proposed contract action.</p>

<DESC>The US Department of Interior, through its Franchise Fund activity, Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD), intends to award a contract to DataScape, LLC, on behalf of the US Department of Agriculture, Risk Management Agency (RMA). This award is intended to be done on a non-competitive basis for the purpose of updating the Nursery Eligible Plant List and Plant Price Schedule (EPLPPS) and Associated Software For the 2015 - 2019 Crop Years. The action is made in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." This acquisition will be made under FAR Parts 12 and 15.
The Risk Management Agency's (RMA) Nursery Crop Insurance Program provides crop insurance coverage to wholesale nurseries for field grown and container grown nursery plants.  The key component of the nursery program is the Eligible Plant List and Plant Price Schedule (EPLPPS), which lists each insurable plant and its assigned plant type, its insurable sizes, its insurability requirements, and the maximum insurable price for each size.  The EPLPPS was developed and first issued by RMA in 1997 (for the 1999 Crop Year).  It is RMA's responsibility to ensure the EPLPPS database is updated annually for each succeeding crop year with new insurable plants and prices, and additional plant prices for existing plants.  Other changes are made as needed to insurability requirements, information, and instructions contained in the EPLPPS.
The EPLPPS database lists all field grown and container grown wholesale nursery plants, which are insurable under the Nursery Crop Insurance Program.  The EPLPPS is issued as eight separate books (PDF Books), with each book specifying insurable plants for one or more states.  The EPLPPS lists base prices for each plant type and measurement method(s) insured under the type.  A plant factor is listed for each applicable measurement method for each plant and is used to establish the maximum insurable price of the plant.  The EPLPPS also specifies hardiness zone limitations for all listed plants and storage protection requirements for container grown plants. 
Three different software packages are used in conjunction with the EPLPPS.  The Regional Office (RO) Plant Selection Software is used by RMA ROs to assist in updating the EPLPPS each crop year.  The RMA ROs use this software twice each crop year to review current EPLPPS specifications and to change specifications if needed.  The Inventory Software is used by crop insurance agents and insureds to determine plant insurability and the value of insurable plants in the nursery based on the EPLPPS.  And finally, the Appraisal Software is used by loss adjusters to aid in the settlement of claims on losses incurred based on insurable plants in the nursery and prices in the EPLPPS.  
DataScape has a unique set of skills to accomplish this task, as they were the developers of the original software and database for this program.  DataScape retains rights to the data and the software necessary for the continued implementation, upgrades, and maintenance of this program. 

THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO AWARD THIS REQUIREMENT NONCOMPETITIVELY IAW FAR 6.302-1.
The relevant NAICS Code is 541519, and the relevant PSC is D399.
The anticipated award date of the contract is 01/17/2013. A vendor must be registered at http://www.sam.gov to be awarded the contract.
Contractors who believe they are capable of meeting the performance requirements should contact the Contracting Officer by electronic mail at James_Tessitore@nbc.gov by 12 PM (ET), 7 December 2012.

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (1), with Oligos Etc. for purchase of oligonucleotide synthesis sequence services.   Synthesis services were performed by Oligos Etc in FY 2009 and before for custom primers needed to support forward and  quote mark in house quote mark  diagnostic assays which use a common chemistry for quality assurance. These are operation critical items for sample testing and support of forward units.  It is paramount that this research project's results be scientifically sound and therefore capable of withstanding the greatest amount of scientific question and scrutiny.  The only way to insure the consistency and scientific merit of the tests is for them to be performed by the same source.  Minute differences in test results of this kind occur between sources.  Those small differences between vendors are enough to compromise the science.  Therefore, the same source must provide all custom primers at the 10 uM scale, HPLC purified, tested and certified throughout the research project.  Oligos Etc is uniquely qualified to synthesize custom primers at the 10 uM scale, HPLC purify them, test them for quality control by capillary electrophoresis, and provide the results of that testing along with a detailed Certificate of Analysis. USAMRIID's research project may be seriously compromised if synthesis services are not obtained from Oligos Etc.   No solicitation package will be issued.  However, responses received by 28 December 2012, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a future competitive procurement.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum:<br /><br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC).

<p>52.212-4 Addenda:<br />(e) "Definitions" is tailored as follows:<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2) "Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs.

<p>(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs, rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br>  <br> (i) Technical capability of the service offered to meet the Government requirement  <br> (ii) Past Performance <br> (iii) Price <br>  <br> (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br>  <br> (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br>  <br> In accordance with the FAR 13.106-1(a) (2), Soliciting Competition, Offerors are notified that award will be made on the basis of best value. Proposals received in response to subject request for proposal (RFP) shall be evaluated for technical acceptability and best value. Technically acceptable offers must meet all minimum specifications but offers which exceed the minimums may be rated more favorably. However, the Government will not pay an unreasonable amount for additional technical capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price. Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price. Notwithstanding that technical capability is more important than price, should all offers appear equal, and price will become the determining factor in the award decision. <br>  <br> 52.216-1 TYPE OF CONTRACT (APR 1984) <br> The Government contemplates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation. <br>  <br> 52.217-8 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999) <br> The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract.

The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 60 DAYS. <br>  <br> 52.217-9 OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000) <br> (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 DAYS; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least sixty (60) DAYS before the contract expires.

<DESC>The U. S. Postal Service plans to issue a Fixed Price Contract to complete a CCTV replacement at the Harrisburg PA P&amp;DC located at 1425 Crooked Hill Road, Harrisburg, PA 17107-9371. All work will be done in accordance with USPS approved specifications and drawings.
<p>The estimated cost of the project is $1,400,000 with construction completion within 210 calendar days from receipt of notice to proceed. Contractors must submit a Qualification Statement and a Management Plan with their price proposal. Only the most qualified contractors will be considered.</p>
<p>To be considered, a company must meet the following minimum requirements:<br />(1) Contractors must be licensed, as required by the State of Pennsylvania, to perform the work as stated in this solicitation.<br />(2) Contractors must have been in the construction business for a minimum of five years as of the date of this solicitation. There is no requirement that eligible contracting firms remained the identical entity for the five-year period, although legal entity changes (such as from a partnership to a corporation) that occurred during this five-year period should be clearly explained, and if key personnel were retained, this should also be clearly explained. <br />(3) Contractor must be capable of obtaining performance and payment bonds for 100% of the contract price.<br />(4) Contractors must provide their EMR rating. If the EMR rating is greater than 1.0, the contractor must provide an explanation from its insurance company in order to be given further consideration for prequalification.<br />(5) Company must submit information for a minimum of one and a maximum of five comparable projects that have either been completed within the past five years or are currently ongoing. Comparable projects are defined as CCTV projects with similar scopes of work and costs of $500,000 or more.</p>
<p>The Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated: experience/performance and capabilities. The price proposals for only the most qualified contractors will be considered. Price will be considered more important than the other evaluation factors contained in the Management Plan. However, the Postal Service will select the offeror that provides the best value to the Postal Service.</p>
<p>Prequalified contractors will be placed on a list for inclusion in future solicitations in this area with similar scopes of work. There is no guarantee that a specific number of solicitations will be issued to these prequalified contractors.</p>
<p>A PRE PROPOSAL MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE SITE ON 12-13-2012, AT 11:00 A.M. ATTENDANCE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p>

Upon award, the name of the successful offeror and the amount of the contract will be released as public information. The names of offerors and the amount of their offers will not be released as public information. This information is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, Exception 4.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Treasury requires a training course to increase all of our bureaus' capacity to assess the outcomes of proposed changes, build organizational support, develop plans to manage the transitions and assess the effectiveness of both the transition and the change. The course entitled, "Leading Strategic Corporate Change and Transition", is a critical piece of the Treasury-wide leadership curriculum for experienced Senior Managers and is designed to encourage best practice leadership behaviors. We believe this course is equally vital for all Senior Managers across the Federal Government. This course will be available to all Treasury Bureaus and may be available to other Federal agencies that participate in Treasury Executive Institute training courses.
<p>All of our Treasury Bureaus and agency partners experience continuous change - some of it minor, but much of it significant. A significant risk of any major change is the failure to manage the transition from &lsquo;what is' to &lsquo;what will be'. While Change Management is an important competency for workers at all levels throughout Treasury and the Federal Government, it is especially critical for the top leaders (experienced Senior Managers and Executive Readiness Program** participants) of these organizations. Successful leaders demonstrate both the ability to envision, market and implement changes and the ability to assume ownership and implement changes designed by others. Their role may vary depending on the magnitude of the change, but one thing will remain constant - their ability to lead the change has the potential to make or break the change.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall deliver an already developed experiential learning** course, "Leading Strategic Corporate Change and Transition", to experienced Treasury-wide (as well as other Agency) Senior Managers, when needed by the Department of Treasury. The course must meet all of the requirements and specifications herein. The IRS, who will administer the contract on behalf of the Department of Treasury, intends to award a performance-based, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract to cover the delivery of (a) the course, (b) course materials, (c) tools and resources, (d) instruction, (e) travel and lodging for Instructors and other designated Contractor Key Personnel and (f) other deliverables as described. The aforementioned deliverables (services) will be ordered via individual Delivery Orders against the contract. The Department of Treasury estimates a maximum of three (3) courses in the Base Year and a maximum of three (3) in each of the four (4) Option Years.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are hereby incorporated by full text:</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development, USAID/RDMA intends to release a solicitation for the ASEAN Connectivity through Trade and Investment (ACTI) activity to provide technical assistance, training, materials, and other resources as needed to accelerate the implementation of select components of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Community Blueprint.
<p>ASEAN is advancing economic integration among its Member States through a harmonized system of protocols and implementation regimes governing intra- and extra-regional investment flows, trade, and the production and movement of goods and services within ASEAN member states and beyond. The activity will focus on assisting ASEAN's regional economic-related working bodies as well as national level assistance in several ASEAN member states to implement their commitments under the ASEAN Economic Community so that the whole of ASEAN will derive the benefits of an integrated and harmonized customs, trading, and investment regime by 2015. The activity will also support overall United States Government economic cooperation with ASEAN, which occurs through various economic agencies in support of the ASEAN-U.S. Trade and Investment Framework Arrangement (TIFA) and other relevant agreements.</p>
<p>The overall development goal of the activity is to strengthen ASEAN integration by expanding capacity in trade, investment and human capital to enable ASEAN to drive its realization of ASEAN Economic Community and integration into the global economy. It will contribute to the overall ASEAN-U.S. Partnership Program effort.</p>
<p>The component objectives of the activity are: (a) strengthened regional integration utilizing an operational ASEAN Single Window architecture, improved terms of trade in the ASEAN region, greater ASEAN member country capacity to implement Single Window systems, and continuation of trade enhancing reforms and standards harmonization in priority industry sectors in collaboration with the private sector; (b) improved capacity of ASEAN Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), particularly in less-developed Members States, to bridge the development gap allowing for effective and leveled participation in the ASEAN Economic Community; (c) strengthen ASEAN capacity to implement its ICT Master Plan; and, (d) increased capacity of ASEAN Member States to facilitate delivery of clean energy and energy efficient technologies to their citizens. Reflecting the demand-driven nature of U.S. assistance to ASEAN and to take advantage of "windows of opportunity" that were not present or accounted for at the design/award stage, the activity will provide flexibility to address relevant elements of the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint and the ASEAN-U.S. Enhanced Partnership Plan of Action (2011-2015).</p>
<p>USAID/RDMA envisions a combination of technical assistance, training and grants (for either U.S. or ASEAN Member State-based organizations) to ensure rapid response to emerging opportunities to achieve activity objectives. USAID also places emphasis on the utilization of regional expertise and partnerships in the provision of technical assistance.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>Attached is the FULL SOLICITATION.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.

Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  <br>    <br>  (i) Technical capability of the service offered to meet the Government requirement   <br>  (ii) Past Performance  <br>  (iii) Price  <br>    <br>  (b) Options.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:   <br>      <br>   (i) Technical capability of the service offered to meet the Government requirement    <br>   (ii) Past Performance   <br>   (iii) Price   <br>      <br>   (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).   <br>      <br>   (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.   <br>      <br>   In accordance with the FAR 13.106-1(a) (2), Soliciting Competition, Offerors are notified that award will be made on the basis of best value. Proposals received in response to subject request for proposal (RFP) shall be evaluated for technical acceptability and best value. Technically acceptable offers must meet all minimum specifications but offers which exceed the minimums may be rated more favorably. However, the Government will not pay an unreasonable amount for additional technical capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price. Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price. Notwithstanding that technical capability is more important than price, should all offers appear equal, and price will become the determining factor in the award decision.   <br>      <br>   52.216-1 TYPE OF CONTRACT (APR 1984)   <br>   The Government contemplates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation.   <br>      <br>   52.217-8 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999)   <br>   The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:    <br>        <br>    (i) Technical capability of the service offered to meet the Government requirement     <br>    (ii) Past Performance    <br>    (iii) Price    <br>        <br>    (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).    <br>        <br>    (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.    <br>        <br>    In accordance with the FAR 13.106-1(a) (2), Soliciting Competition, Offerors are notified that award will be made on the basis of best value. Proposals received in response to subject request for proposal (RFP) shall be evaluated for technical acceptability and best value. Technically acceptable offers must meet all minimum specifications but offers which exceed the minimums may be rated more favorably. However, the Government will not pay an unreasonable amount for additional technical capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price. Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price. Notwithstanding that technical capability is more important than price, should all offers appear equal, and price will become the determining factor in the award decision.    <br>        <br>    52.216-1 TYPE OF CONTRACT (APR 1984)    <br>    The Government contemplates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation.    <br>        <br>    52.217-8 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999)    <br>    The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 60 DAYS.    <br>        <br>    52.217-9 OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000)    <br>    (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 DAYS; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least sixty (60) DAYS before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.    <br>    (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.    <br>    (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed (4) FOUR YEARS AND (6) SIX MONTHS.    <br>        <br>    52.232-99 PROVIDING ACCELERATED PAYMENT TO SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTORS (DEVIATION)(AUG 2012)    <br>    This clause implements the temporary policy provided by OMB Policy Memorandum M-12-16, Providing Prompt Payment to Small Business Subcontractors, dated July 11, 2012.     <br>    (a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the contractor is required to make accelerated payments to small business subcontractors to the maximum extent practicable after receipt of a proper invoice and all proper documentation from the small business subcontractor.     <br>    (b) Include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (b), in all subcontracts with small business concerns.    <br>    (c) The acceleration of payments under this clause does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act.    <br>        <br>    52.252-1 SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)    <br>    This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(1) o&nbsp;Are, o&nbsp;are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(2) o&nbsp;Have, o&nbsp;have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; </span></p>

<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(A) <em>The tax liability is finally determined</em>. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(B) <em>The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment</em>. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(ii) <em>Examples</em>. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). </span></p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), US Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112 , Washington, D.

<DESC><p>Amendment Number: 002 (A002) <br />Questions and Answers (Q&amp;A)</p>
<p>1. Could you provide further details, if any, on evaluation criteria-such as weights given to staff, firm experience, approach/work plan, and technical/price offers?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: <br />See Combined Synopsis/Solicitation posted on FedBizOpps (FBO) or www.fbo.gov under solicitation number RFQ-CO201351044 that list six (6) evaluations factors.</strong></p>
<p>Question:<br />2. Period of performance is said to be one year from signature, although all deliverables are due by April 2013-does this mean there will be a retainer following the DM's completion for any follow-on work or advice needed?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:<br />There is no retainer. While the deliverables are due by April 2013, the period of performance is for a larger span of time in the event that it is not possible to complete the deliverables by the referenced date due to circumstances beyond the DM Contractor's control. </strong></p>
<p>Question: <br />3. Could you provide any indication of budget allocated for this job, or expected level of effort?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:<br />See Combined Synopsis /Solicitation as posted on FBO - "The historical cost for a similar requirement is $65,000.00." </strong></p>
<p>Question:<br />Could you confirm whether we must include in our price offer the cost of the Defense Base Act insurance and MEDEVAC insurance?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:<br />The contractor should not include the cost of either insurance in their quote.</strong></p>

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

<p>Many of our shortcomings relate to strategic and acquisition planning, contract administration, and program oversight. These shortcomings directly relate to the competency and knowledge base levels of our integrated acquisition workforce. Other issues of concern include:</p>
<p>&bull; Organizational conflict of interest (OCI) rules are not standardized across the agency<br />&bull; Risk tolerance is low <br />&bull; Productive competition is often hampered by unclear, inconsistent policies and cumbersome requirements<br />&bull; Momentum for integration of our acquisition, engineering, and budget processes is moving too slowly<br />&bull; Efforts to enhance communications and collaboration are maturing at too slow a pace</p>
<p>NGA's overarching strategy is to collaborate with industry over a sustained period of time -- to listen, learn, and improve. As we move forward, this will involve large and small group sessions targeted toward both traditional and non-traditional NGA contractors. NGA Deputy Director Mike Rodrigue is committed to engaging business leaders in on-going discussions on what NGA might do to improve our business practices and leverage industry expertise in developing innovative solutions to long term issues. NGA recently completed the first in a series of in-house meetings to introduce the concept of business collaboration with acquisition professionals. As a follow-on to that meeting, a large group event is in the planning stages to include both industry and acquisition professionals together in a problem solving session. This will occur on 11 December 2012 and be followed up with multiple small group sessions throughout calendar year 2013.</p>
<p><strong>2. NGA Government-Industry Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p>In listening to industry partners and professionals across NGA, several themes continue to arise that will serve as initial topics for NGA-industry collaborative discussions:<br /><br /><strong>OCI</strong></p>
<p>1. OCI has been a concern for some time now, with profound effects on industry. Given the legislative atmosphere and the way NGA has been addressing OCI, what recommendations do you have for making this issue more manageable? <br />2. Do you foresee the need for any further corporate restructuring to accommodate OCI? <br />3. How do you see NGA improving procedures to avoid OCI issues?</p>
<p><strong>Barriers to Competition</strong></p>
<p>4. Does NGA's handling of competitive procurements provide sufficient opportunities for your purposes? What changes can you recommend to improve the process? <br />5. What suggestions could you provide that would help expand access and remove barriers to increase competition on NGA procurements? <br />6. How could we allow better access to NGA buildings and decision makers?</p>
<p><strong>Procurement Processes</strong></p>
<p>7. What practices could NGA adopt that would allow for more rapid acquisition of technology and services?</p>
<p><strong>Workforce</strong></p>
<p>8. What recommendations do you have to enhance the NGA workforce's competencies to handle the award and execution of complex IT contracts? <br />9. What could NGA do that would better enable it to develop and retain its IT acquisition expertise?</p>
<p><strong>Risk</strong></p>
<p>10. NGA portrays itself as an organization with a transformative vision. Does our willingness to accept risk support this characterization?<br />11. Most NGA source selection decisions are based on a Best Value approach. Do you believe this to be reality, or do you believe that the decisions are driven by the lowest bids?</p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
<p>12. How might NGA balance an increased focus on more open communication with industry on procurement opportunities without increasing exposure to more industry protests? <br />13. What do you believe we could do to increase communication during the acquisition process (pre/post award)? <br />14. What can NGA do to minimize its risk to protests by unsuccessful offerors while maintaining its ability to engage with industry in a more collaborative and communicative environment? What can you (industry) do to allay the government's concerns?<br />15. How satisfied are you today with the level of communication afforded by NGA throughout the acquisition process? Is communication better at sometimes than others? What can we do to improve these communications?</p>
<p><strong>3. Industry Responses [Comments / Questions / Thoughts / Recommendations]</strong></p>
<p>Industry members are encouraged to respond to NGA with comments, questions, etc., related to the topic questions above. NGA will not be posting formal responses to information received, but rather information gained from industry and other sources will be used to help frame out the agenda and discussion areas for the NGA Collaboration Forum. To help NGA build the final agenda and discussion items, responses to the NGA Government-Industry Discussion Questions should be submitted by 28 November 2012 via the <strong>Unclassified IC-ARC at:</strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://arc.westfields.net</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Responses shall not include proprietary information. Any responses that are marked proprietary will not be considered. No marketing materials will be accepted. Should you have questions regarding use of the Unclassified IC-ARC, please contact the ACE IT Support Team at 703-230-6300.</p>

<p>Questions regarding this event should be directed to the NGA point of contacts for this event: William Clougherty at (571) 558-1521 or Kemisola Lofinmakin at (571) 557-5149, or unclassified email at <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NGACollaborationForum@nga.mil</span></strong>.</p>

The limited ILS package being procured will include a Navy Work Package (WP) technical manual, Maintenance Requirements Card, Engineering Drawings for Provisioning (EDFP) and Hazardous Materials Report including Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) on a sole source basis with Test Systems International, Inc. (TSI).
<p>The Government plans to procure 13 MMPUs along with a limited logistics package over the life of the contract. In July 2010, in response to multiple Broad Arrow (BA) messages from the Fleet for obsolete legacy assets, NAVAIR completed an Urgent Need Sole Source procurement of ten units from TSI as an immediate stop gap solution. The current procurement for&nbsp;THIRTEEN units is to replace the remainder of the Fleet's inventory of legacy assets. The emergency buy did not include a logistics package, so the Fleet does not have logistics support in place for the existing ten units. soliciting this requirement by full and open competition is not effective as TSI is the only known source with the knowledge and capability to provide a unit that has proven availability to demonstrate reliability and sustainability in a fleet environment without a disruption in schedule or degradation of performance. NAWCADLKE intends to award this contract under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (C)(1), as implemented in FAR 6.302-1. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government will consider all responses received to this notice. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation will be available for this procurement.</p>

<DESC>This is the annual synopsis for the FY 2013 fiscal year an established 5 year Repair Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) .  The repairable components are for the P3C USQ 78  Acoustic.  This  BOA supports the repair of 25 line components, which has been uploaded with this synopsis as an Attachment A. The line items listed on Attachment A, will be repaired by Lockheed Martin  (52088) which, is located in Manassa VA and is the place of performance. Lockheed Martin  is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of these requirements and is the only known source to possess full repair capability.  Complete data, drawings and the rights to the same are not available from the Government. Therefore, the items listed on Attachment A, are sole source to Lockheed Martin  .
   Even though these items are sole source to Lockheed Martin , all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  For any questions concerning this notice, contact the PCO, Regina Neal at (215) 697-5815

The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.  Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items will be solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained at â€œhttps://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_oppsâ€ or by calling the NAVICP PCO.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.
  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

The contractor shall provide analytic services, including cost-benefit and/or other economic analyses, market penetration assessments, etc., to evaluate the effectiveness of current Agency policies on indoor environmental quality and provide recommendations for improvements; B.  The contractor shall provide support to analyze, disseminate, support, and/or develop information and materials on indoor air quality related issues; C. The contractor shall provide support for developing effective methods to communicate with the ge neral public and with specified target audiences,  domestically and internationally, such as:  school decision makers, parents, school-based personnel; health care providers, asthma patients and their care givers; parents and public health advocates concerned about children?s exposure to secondhand smoke; homeowners, home buyers and sellers, renters, code officials, and the real estate and building industries regarding the health impacts of radon exposure and other indoor air pollutants; building owners and facility and energy managers concerning proper design, construction, operation, and maintenance of buildings for healthy indoor air quality and reduced vulnerability to intentional releases of biological or chemical contaminants; health care industry regarding incorporation of environmental controls into standards of care; and other audiences with whom the Program may choose to communicate messages concerning risks and risk reduction in the indoor environment; D.  Public  demand for knowledge about indoor environmental problems, including their health risks and the means by which human exposure can be reduced, has been fueled by a growing body of scientific information confirming the adverse impacts of poor indoor air quality on health, comfort, and productivity.  The program recognizes the need for a variety of audiences to understand these risks and to be informed about available methods for risk reduction.  As a voluntary program, two of the main objectives of the program are to: (1) develop and disseminate information, including technical and non-technical guidance;  and (2) conduct education and outreach activities that will inform a broad range of potential users, including the general public; building design, construction, and facility and energy management professionals; private sector diagnostic and mitigation firms; industry associations; environmental researchers and experts; indoor environments educators; EPA program partners; pub lic health and advocacy organizations; health practitioners; environmental health officials at Federal, state, and local levels; and related groups; E.  The Program works with Agencies and organizations at the Federal, state and local level, with other nations, and with a range of domestic and international stakeholder and target audience groups, to promote more effective approaches to identifying and solving indoor environmental problems as well as applying community leadership and social marketing techniques to accelerate environmental risk reduction results.  To provide effective communication, the Program may initiate meetings, training, conferences, events, or workshops, or work collaboratively with others to do so; and F.  Among the key responsibilities of the Indoor Environments Divisions are the development and dissemination of publications and other outreach materials and the live presentation of both substantive and organizational information to a variety of audien ces.  The resultant contract shall provide the necessary labor, material, facilities, and expertise required for the performance of tasks specified in the Statement of Work (SOW) (See Draft Statement of Work at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/index.htm#sources). Specific details of the requirement will be outlined in the Statement of Work.

The system provides for efficient loading of environmental data (location meta data, sample analysis results, field parameters, etc.) into a relational database and automates many basic quality assurance, routine data analysis, and reporting tasks required under the RFI. The DBMS may be executed either locally with a desktop installation (Desktop DBMS) to upload and analyze project specific data, or using the GSA application portal (Site-Wide DBMS) via the internet for verification of project-specific data deliverables and for analysis and reporting of site-wide RFI data. The DBMS is propitiatory code and is being made available to responders for use to respond to this effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Access to the DBMS and will be granted upon award of specific projects. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Use of this program on any projects other than those required by GSA is prohibited.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR INVITATION FOR BID. INFORMATION RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS REQUEST WILL BE CONSIDERED PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE AND WILL NOT BE RELEASED TO ANY OTHER PARTY, FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO DEVELOP MARKET INFORMATION FOR INTERNAL USE BY THE ST. LOUIS DISTRICT, CORPS OF ENGINEERS. The NAICS code for this proposed acquisition is 237990. The Product Service Code is Y299. The control number for this notice is W912P9-13-S-001. The Government will use responses to this Sources Sought notice to make appropriate acquisition decisions regarding the possible procurement of Chain of Rocks Ditch Work, Phase 2 <br>  <br> Project Description <br> The project consists of replacing an existing 48 quote mark  culvert with a 72 quote mark  diameter reinforced concrete pipe (RCP). The section of new pipe is approximately 230 feet in length, and is underneath an existing railroad embankment. The height of fill over the culvert ranges from approximately 15 feet outside the railroad embankment to approximately 35 feet directly under the railroad tracks. Four new precast concrete manholes will be required in order to tie into the existing 72 quote mark  RCP that exists on either side of the existing 48 quote mark  culvert. Two existing manholes will be removed. <br>  <br> The means of installation of the culvert will be by the jack-and-bore method. This specialized method is required to minimize disturbance to the embankment, and the operations of the railroad. This method includes excavating adjacent to the railroad embankment on each side, and pushing the sections of RCP through the embankment by boring through the soil and jacking against the wall of the excavation. The selected contractor must be capable of completing the project using this jack-and-bore method. The project will not be allowed to be constructed using open-cut excavations through the railroad embankment. <br>  <br> The PDT recommends experience requirements be placed on the contractor to ensure a capable contractor with prior experience with this specialized jack-and-bore method is selected.  The recommended requirement is that the contractor has completed no fewer than three successful projects using this method to install RCP culverts of at least 60 inches in diameter. Contractor will have at least three years experience in using the jack-and-bore method within a five year period. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> Contractors will provide:  <br>  <br> 1) Firm name, address, e-mail, telephone and fax number.  <br>  <br> 2) If submitting as a small business, provide identification of the company as a Small Business with proper certification; 8(a), Hub Zone, Service Disabled Veteran or Woman-Owned.  <br>  <br> 3) Address your capability to secure bonding for the projects described above in the range of $500,000.00 to $1,000,000.00 Million. <br>  <br> 4) Experience of five years using the jack-and-bore method. The estimated price range of each project is between $500,000.00 and $1,000,000.00.  The NAICS Code is 237990 and the small business size standard is $33.5 million.  The Corp will require the prime contractor to have documentable experience showing completed projects of similar size and scope using the jack-and-bore method.  Firms interested and capable of providing the required services should provide: <br>  <br>  a)      The company name, address, Point of Contact (POC), size of business pursuant to the following questions:  (1) is your business small?  (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emerging business or a small disadvantaged business?  (3)  If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and if your firm is certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business.  (4)  Is your firm a certified Hub Zone firm?  (5)  Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business:   <br>  <br>  b)     At least three (3) similar, completed contracts within a five year period, performance rating and POC.   <br>  <br> 5.

Background The Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Collaborative Program (Program), using U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) Program funds, executed a contract in FY2011 for the development of an adaptive management (AM) Plan. Version 1 of the AM Plan was delivered to the Program in October 2011 (http://www.mrgesa.com/Default.aspx?tabid=460). The successful offeror will continue to develop, refine, and implement AM throughout the Program using Version 1 of the AM Plan as a template. <br /><br />Adaptive management (AM) is a rigorous approach for designing and implementing management actions affecting the natural and human environments, which intend to maximize learning about critical uncertainties that affect decisions, while simultaneously striving to meet multiple management objectives. It involves synthesizing existing knowledge and identifying critical uncertainties, developing scientific hypotheses related to those critical uncertainties, and exploring alternative management actions to test those hypotheses. These management actions will include explicit predictions of their outcomes including level of risk involved with implementation. Finally, science-based monitoring and research will be conducted to see if the actual outcomes match those predicted, and then these results will be used to learn and adjust future management and policy. <br /><br />B. Work to be Performed. Building on Version 1 of the AM Plan, the contractor will add on to the existing plan by developing the quote mark Priority Projects and Processes quote mark of AM. Tasks would include: a) work with the Program to establish a Policy Group and a science-based Technical Group to work on the AM, b) develop an updated list of critical uncertainties and scientific hypotheses generated by the Program, based on those developed in Version 1 of the AM Plan (including a 2-day workshop to discuss findings with Program members), c) develop a list of the 'top five priority AM actions' that could be pursued by the Program and develop a plan for implementing, monitoring and evaluating those AM actions, d) develop a Strategic Program AM Guide, and e) develop an AM Tracking Tool that documents evaluation criteria in order to document success and develop management decisions. This Tool will be part of the Program's Database Management System (http://mrgescp.dbstephens.com/#Home). These tasks would take place over a 2-year period. <br /><br />Estimated duration of the project is 2 years. <br /><br />Minimum capabilities required include: <br />1) 5 years minimum experience with 'adaptive management' of ecological resources <br />2) Key Personnel working on this project should have at least 5 years experience and a Master's Degree (preferred) in the fields of ecological, biological, or environmental science. Key Personnel should have the following expertise: <br />a. Project Management <br />b. AM specialist with professional experience in and applied knowledge of ecological, biological, and environmental processes. <br />c. Experience in southwest river systems and related T&amp;E species. <br />d. Experience managing adaptive management of ecological resource policy and technical meetings with diverse stakeholders <br /><br />3) At least 3 examples (within the past 5 years) of projects similar to the work and scale to be done on this project. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System code for this procurement is 541620 which has a small business size standard of $14,000,000. The Standard Industrial Code is 8742. <br /><br />Small Businesses are reminded under FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting that they must perform at least 50% of the cost of the contract with their own employees. <br /><br />Prior Government contract work is not required for submitting a response under this sources sought synopsis. <br /><br />Anticipated solicitation issuance date is on or about January 4, 2013 and the estimated proposal due date will be on or about February 4, 2013.

The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 623110 with the small business size standard of $13.5 million.  
The Sioux Falls VA Health Care System Under Statutory Authority 41 USC 253 (c)(5) and 38 U.S.C. 1720 the Government anticipates entering into acquisition negotiations and award of a Basic Ordering Agreement for placement of eligible veterans into a nursing home facility located in Sioux Center, Iowa, for a Base Year period 12/1/2012 - 11/30/2013 with four (4) Option Years.

STATEMENT OF WORK:  
1. The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.
2.  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
3.  Absences of the patient from the nursing home in excess of 48 hours will not be reimbursable.
4.  Patients, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
5.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this contract dies, the nursing home will promptly notify the VA facility authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by the VA patients upon the premises of the nursing home shall be delivered by the nursing home to the person or persons entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the nursing home for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs, or next of kin capable of inheriting.  When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with annotation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA facility authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases the nursing home will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA facility authorizing admission and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.
6.  The nursing home shall not maintain nor provide dual or segregated patient facilities, which are segregated on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin.  The nursing home shall neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such use by local custom.  The term facilities shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, and other like areas.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to inspection of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well being of the patient is rendered.
7.  Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and not to exceed 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA facility will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
8.  If a veteran is re-hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility will arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the patient and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days will be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but will not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  The VA facility will include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the conditions above are met.
9.  The VA facility will approve leave days (days away from the nursing home) for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a therapeutic plan and approved by VA.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  Exceptions may be approved by the VA facility director or designee.
10.  Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
11.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
12.  The nursing home shall provide all services specified herein, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting will not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.
13.  It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA will provide follow-up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back into the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.
14.  All medical records concerning the veteran's care in the nursing home will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records will be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (Â§5 U.S.C. 552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient, which includes at least the following: Admission identification record; VA Form 10 1204, Referral for Community Nursing Home Care or State-approved referral form; Admitting evaluation (including diagnosis by nursing home physician; Physician orders; Progress notes; the physician orders/notes shall be charted immediately after patient is seen; special reports (laboratory, x ray, activity, etc.; SMA Patient Assessment Form (only if SMA level of care is used); and Minimum Data Set (MDS) information, provided to VA upon admission and every six months thereafter.
15.  The beneficiary will be provided nursing home care at the expense of VA for a period not in excess of that stated in the nursing care and treatment plan received from VA unless an extension of the authorization is provided in writing by the placing VA facility.
16.  The contract for the affected patient will terminate whenever a VA patient is rehospitalized for 15 calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility.  A new authorization agreement and contract will be considered at the time the patient returns.
17.  Level of Care Classification Effective Records: VA will contract for 50 categories of care under Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-IV).  The level of care classification and associated per diem rate will remain in effect for each placement until and unless one of the following events takes place: (a) The recipient is discharged and subsequently qualifies for a new admission assessment, (b)The nursing home's Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment will be completed at customary times during a patient's stay, dependent on projection for short term or long term residence, and adhering to the most current MDS frequency guidelines from Medicare MDS or BRA or MPAF.  The applicable per diem rate will continue until the next assessment. In addition, assessment will be made eight (8) days after the completion of an episode of authorized rehabilitation therapy, after a rehospitalization, after a significant change in status and at VA's request.  Classification changes will be approved by VA. VA staff will audit approximately 20% of the MDS assessments.  Based on these findings, VA retains the right to remove the automatic applicability of the nursing home generated MDS assessment for payment purposes, and (c) Therapy Requirements - All therapy provided under this contract will be individual therapy, rather than group therapy, unless otherwise ordered by the authorizing VA facility.  NOTE: Prior to starting a therapy program, facility must obtain VA pre-authorization.
18.  The VA, at its sole option, will monitor the professional care and administrative management of services provided to VA beneficiaries under this agreement, through one or any combination of the following methods; reviews of state agencies reports, on-site inspection of the Nursing Home by VA staff, and/or on-site monitoring of VA patients.  It is agreed that the Nursing Home shall provide VA with copies of all state agency reports when requested, and cooperate fully with VA's quality improvement-quality assurance program functions relating to this agreement, including VA's on-site inspection and monitoring.   The VA Contracting Officer shall make all final determinations as to the contractor's reasonable cooperation with VA and compliance with these requirements.
SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: (1) TERMINATION OF SERVICES:  VA reserves the right to remove any or all VA patients from the nursing home at any time, when it is determined to be in the best interest of the VA or the patients, without additional costs to the Government (2) EXTENSION OF AGREEMENT:  This agreement may be extended for four (4) one year periods at the option of the Government in accordance with 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.  Notice of an extension must be served in writing by the Government thirty days prior to the scheduled expiration date.  The extension is granted subject to the availability of funds, (3) MINIMUM QUANTITIES:  It is impossible to determine the exact or estimated amount, which will be expended under this agreement.  No obligation will be incurred by VA under this agreement, until authorizations are issued for nursing home care of specific beneficiaries.  VA agrees to make payment on a timely basis for services rendered in accordance with such authorizations upon receipt of proper invoices submitted by the nursing home as outlined in this agreement.  VA will make payment for the day a recipient enters the facility but not the day the recipient leaves a facility unless entrance and departure are on the same day, then payment will be made for one day, (4) LIFE SAFETY CODE CLAUSE:  The administrator of your facility is required to notify the VA Contracting Officer at least 3 days prior to any planned facility changes that could impact the Life Safety Code and other safety features of the facility, which were in existence at the time this contract was issued.  The VA Contracting Officer will notify the VA Fire Safety Officer responsible for the Life Safety Code inspection of your facility and he/she will review (inspect the facility if required) the proposed changes and provide necessary approval/disapproval of your facility to house veterans during and/or after the proposed changes. Examples of facility change (but not limited to) that require VA Contracting Officer notification are as follows; interior finish, corridor partitions/walls, patient room doors, linen/trash chutes, exits, emergency lighting, fire alarm systems, automatic sprinklers, smoke barrier walls/doors, oxygen systems, compressed gas storage, HVAC, electrical and fuel gas systems, (5) If the veteran had a former VA primary care physician, VA policy precludes this provider being available to the veteran during the period of nursing home care.  The assigned nursing home physician is the primary doctor during the nursing home stay and is responsible for writing or approving admission and all other orders as soon as the veteran arrives at the community nursing home.  The community nursing home physician is responsible for general medical care, urgent evaluation and intervention.  Physician visits will be according to medical assistance guidelines.  The assigned nursing home physician will provide timely care following the most current CMS guidelines; arranging 24/7 access for patient care, easy access to staff for consultation, provide timely response to calls and arrange for timely physician back-up according to OBRA guidelines (Ref. 42 CFR 483.40 OBRA Guidelines), (6) In emergencies, nursing home staff will utilize the 911 local emergency systems as for any resident; advance directives/living wills shall be considered according to nursing home doctor's orders.  When private hospitalization or emergency services are required, the patient, spouse, financial guardian, or insurer is financially responsible.  Service connected veterans may qualify for VA coverage of emergency care provided the VAMC is contacted by the private hospital physician within 72 hours of admission.  This includes the cost of necessary transportation for such care, (7) VA MEDICAL CENTER CONSULTATION/RESOURCES: (a)  Telephone Care Communications System (TCCS):  For urgent-same day outpatient specialty care or for non-urgent scheduled clinic appointments/consultations, phone 605-336-3230 x6181 between 9AM and 3PM Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.  If a same day appointment is anticipated, please call as early as possible, (b) Admissions System phone number 605-336-3230.  For non-emergency consultation/evaluation for admission to the VA Medical Center (after initial evaluation/intervention by the nursing home physician), (8) Ancillary Services/Supplies:  Any additional cost to the all-inclusive contract must be preapproved according to the following terms: (a) Medications/supplies will be billed/paid according to generic average wholesale pricing guidelines; monthly invoices verifying cost must be submitted for payment of any additional approved rates. Discharge Medications - on the day of discharge, the facility will dispense medications for a 14 day supply to the veteran and facility can bill to the VA at the AWP, and  (b)  Billing:  The patient, family and any other entitlement programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid) will not be billed for uncovered services/costs during the VA contract period.  This constitutes double billing and Federal fraud, (9) The VAMC will pay two-day bed hold for therapeutic passes or re-hospitalization; for longer periods the family must make arrangements with the contract facility to hold a bed.  Reimbursement for all bed holds will be 70% of the prevailing per diem rate.  After a patient absence of fifteen (15) consecutive days the patient authorization for VA contract care ends, and (10) The contract nursing home will assume responsibility for arranging dental care at the veteran's/families' expense.
