The FAA currently operates numerous distinct primary radar systems for terminal aircraft surveillance and airport hazardous weather detection in the nations terminal airspace. These radar systems, Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) models 8, 9, and 11 are nearing the end of their life cycle and will require Service Life Extension Programs (SLEPs) to continue operational service. Sustainment and upgrade programs can keep these radars operating in the near to mid-term. For the long term, the FAA recognizes that replacement of these radars is the best option. The Next Generation Surveillance and Weather Radar Capability (NSWRC) Program is currently in the investment analysis phase. 

2.	Introduction/Purpose

The FAA has a requirement for a comprehensive solution(s) to address several issues of immediate concern impacting the operational readiness, sustainability and maintainability of the ASR-9 system including but not limited to the following:

a.	Resolve numerous supportability and maintenance issues that have surfaced over the years since the system was initially fielded in 1987.  
b.	Provide for consolidation of components and functions, 
c.	Consider potential future supportability and maintenance issues.  
d.	Requires the use of COTS and non-proprietary hardware and software unless an exemption or waiver is approved.
e.	Provide an itemized listing of potential COTS items to be included as part of the proposed solution.

<DESC>This Design-Build (DB) project repairs by replacement the main cross connect saltwater distribution piping which traverses the waterfront from the east of Dry Dock 3 to the west of Dry Dock 5 along with adapting the salt water intakes at both Dry Dock 6 and building 1003, Salt Water Pump Station, to meet CFR 40 and Clean Water Act requirements, for the reduction of cooling water intake velocities. The replacement facilities will incorporate features that provide the lowest practical lifecycle cost solutions; satisfying the facilities requirements; and the goal of maximizing energy efficiency and reliability.

The project scope provides for structural repairs by replacing approximately 3,620 linear feet of 20 piping supports, anchors and seismic bracing; mechanical repairs by replacing approximately 3,620 linear feet of 20cement lined ductile iron pipe or if applicable HDPE 20 pipe including associated distribution valves, connectors and manifold devices; in addition the project includes electrical cathodic protection, salt water distribution system access, and station support for the area.

The project will be located at Naval Base Kitsap, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility; Bremerton Washington.
  The estimated total contract price range, in accordance with FAR 36.204, is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.

This procurement shall be in accordance with FAR 52.225-11 and 12, Buy American Act Construction Materials. This procurement uses the two-phase design-build selection procedures in accordance with FAR 36.3 and consists of one solicitation covering both phases. This procurement will be solicited utilizing full and open competition.
Source Selection procedures will be used with the intent to award a firm-fixed price construction contract to the responsible Offeror whose proposal, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.
  The firm needs to be able to demonstrate knowledge, current relevant qualifications, experience, bonding, and the capability to perform a design/build construction contract similar to the scope indicated. 

The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions. Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following: PHASE I: Factor 1  Technical Approach, Factor 2  Experience, Factor 3  Past Performance, and Factor 4  Safety;  PHASE II: Factor 5  Technical Solution, Factor 6  Small Business Utilization, and Price.  The Phase I evaluation will result in a determination of the most highly qualified Offerors.  These Offerors will be requested to submit a Phase II proposal.
  A maximum of five (5) Offerors will be selected to submit a Phase II proposal unless the Contracting Officer determines that a number greater than five is in the Governments interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of two-phase design-build contracting. 

THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. The Phase I RFP will be posted on the NECO website at www.neco.navy.mil on or about November 9, 2015. No hard copies will be provided. IT IS THE CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEBSITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THE SOLICITATION. Prospective Offerors MUST register on the website. Plan holders lists will not be faxed and will be available only at the website listed above.
 

A pre-proposal conference will be scheduled for mid-November the Naval Undersea Museum, 1 Garnett Way, Keyport, WA 98345.  The final date of the pre-proposal conference will be specified in the solicitation. Registration for the conference will be by email. A site visit will be held only during Phase II and only for those that have been selected to proceed to Phase II.

No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with this announcement, attending pre-proposal conferences or any follow-up information requests.  

Results of Sources Sought
A sources sought was used to conduct market research to determine if qualified small businesses were interested in performing this project.
  The sources sought notice was issued using solicitation number N4425516MKTG46004, which was posted on August 13, 2015 with a due date of August 31, 2015. The sources sought requested responses from interested prime contractors and statements of capabilities.   The Government received a total of three responses from small business concerns.  The firms did not possess the relevant specialized experience as defined in the notice or could not meet the bonding capacity. In addition to the notice, based on a SBA Pronet search by NAICS code 237110, sources sought was distributed via email. Only two responses were received; neither of which possessed the capabilities specified. Therefore, the contracting officer determined there is not a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two or more responsible small business concerns in accordance with FAR 19.502-2.
  Based on the market research, it was determined that this procurement will be solicited utilizing full and open competition.  The Seattle Small Business Administration (SBA) Office concurred with this decision.

<DESC>This is an annual synopsis of Repair Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00383-14-G-007N with North Star Scientific Corporation (cage code 3YJM5) and serves as the pre-solicitation synopsis notice for all repair orders issued by the NAVSUP WSS for fiscal year 2016 for the repair coverage of the E-2C Aircraft. 

See the enclosed attachment for the list of repair items.

For any questions concerning this notice, contact Kathryn Hull, 215-697-1219.

The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited.
 The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochure listed below. 

Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx 

This brochure identifies the technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval.
 Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP WSS Commercial Item Identification Brochure is now available at: https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx.

<SOLNBR>RFI_DEC_15_177(2020Census)
<RESPDATE>111615
<CONTACT>Nicholas Apperson, Email nicholas.apperson@census.gov
<DESC>The business goal of this Request for Information (RFI) is to survey commercial offerings and determine the most effective means of electronically generating materials and data to use for 2020 Census IT and operational testing. These means could possibly include data buys or acquiring a capability to generate the materials in-house.
<p>The Census Bureau's mission is to serve as the leading source of quality data about the nation's people and economy. We honor privacy, protect confidentiality, share our expertise globally, and conduct our work openly. As mandated by the U.S. Constitution, America gets just one chance each decade to count its population. The Census Bureau operates under Title 13 and Title 26 of the U.S. Code.</p>
<p>The next Census in 2020 will require counting an increasingly diverse and growing population of around 330 million people in more than 142 million housing units. To get an accurate count, the Census Bureau must build an accurate address list of every housing unit, maximize self-response to the census, and efficiently follow up with those who do not respond.<br />Currently we are conducting research in four areas that focus on the major cost drivers of the decennial census:</p>
<p>&bull; Use the Internet to increase self-response.<br />&bull; Use existing government data sources to answer census questions and reduce follow-up workloads.<br />&bull; Automate operations to increase productivity and reduce staff and offices.<br />&bull; Use existing maps and address to reflect changes rather than walking every block in every neighborhood in America.</p>
<p>Certain tests require data sets that may be protected by Title 13 or Title 26 or that are considered sensitive or PII. This requires the implementation of very specific security measures before the conduct of the test. This is especially true in newly considered environments like Cloud that are not Census provided and/or operated. Having access to data sets that simulate Census data formats but are not actual Census data or based on actual Census data (not considered Title 13, Title 26, Sensitive or PII) can expedite testing activities. These data could be used for operational testing or in implementing an Enterprise Development, Test, and Integration Environment that would leverage multiple types of test data for use across multiple project teams.</p>

<a href="mailto:sean.g.auld.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Natick (SPS)</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center, Product Manager, Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS), Natick, MA is conducting Market Research regarding industry's interest and capability in providing a replacement for the Mobile Kitchen Trailer (MKT), first fielded in 1975. This Sources Sought Request for Information is part of that market research, which may assist the Government in developing future procurement strategies. The MKT replacement system shall be called the Battlefield Kitchen (BK). Like the MKT, the BK will be a trailer based kitchen, sized to feed up to 300 personnel at remote field sites. It will be towed by the Light Medium Tactical Vehicle (LMTV) and prepare the full range of military rations. <br>  <br> The BK will have the same basic capabilities as the current MKT with significant improvements in key areas. The BK will be a mobile trailer based system capable of being transported overland (road and cross country). It will also be transported by rail and air, by both helicopter sling load and fixed wing aircraft (C-130 and larger). Basic improvements expected from the BK are in the areas of kitchen work area efficiency, appliance efficiency, kitchen air quality, work area lighting, kitchen noise reduction, appliance temperature control, and kitchen environmental control. <br>  <br> The MKT utilizes the Modern Burner Unit (MBU) as the heat source for its appliances. These are 'open flame' burners that operate on JP-8 and a small amount of electrical power (75 watts) required for ignition, controls, air pumps, etc. Significant improvements over the MKT appliances are required of the BK appliances. The BK appliances are being designed around two basic principles: 1) the appliances will adhere to a standardized footprint of 22 inches wide by 27 inches deep. This will allow for complete interchangeability between appliances in any given layout, and 2) the ability to collect and expel cooking and combustion effluent from the kitchen.  This ability must be downloadable into alternate structures/shelters with the appliances. Once downloaded the system can be reassembled into a fully functional, ventilated kitchen. The appliances must also be download for individual stand-alone applications. The goal is to provide a safe and productive work environment regardless of the ventilation properties of the site chosen.   <br>  <br> The government has been developing designs of the BK modular appliances, their heat source burner, and the BK platform. The intent is for the Government to provide the technical data developed to date to the BK contractor. The Government has done much of the conceptual and developmental work on the BK and components to reduce risk and fulfill its intention to have Government purpose rights and configuration control of the BK, modular appliances, and burner. These data rights will be used for full and open competition in future follow-on contracts for BK production and support. The drawing package will not be complete at the time of this upcoming contract. The intent of the contract is to have the BK contract awardee complete the developmental work and technical data package. Subsequent production and support contracts will be fully competed using the technical data completed and obtained during this first contract. Status of current efforts is as follows: <br>  <br> BK appliance burner: The appliance burner is in near production ready condition. Following performance verification this year it is expected that a complete and verified drawing package will be available at the time of the developmental contract award.   <br>  <br> Modular Appliances: The government is currently in possession of technical data and prototypes that function at about 80% of the desired performance. A design upgrade is in progress to reduce weight and cost, and increase performance to the project threshold levels as a minimum. The technical data along with prototype equipment, and all test data will be made available to the BK developer to complete the development to include producability. If the Contractor prefers to present their own design, government purpose rights to all technical data will be sought and taken into consideration during proposal evaluation. <br>  <br> BK platform: The BK platform design is mostly conceptual at this time. The government has developed and possesses a solid model of components in various stages of development. It is anticipated that some of the design features will be proven through prototyping and demonstration in FY2015. All technical data and test data will be made available to contractors at the time of the release of the Request for Proposals (RFP). It will be the prospective Contractor's responsibility to review the government data presented and determine the suitability of the design and data for this effort. The contractor will be responsible for meeting all of the performance requirements of the BK regardless of the extent to which they use the government technical data unless adherence to the technical data in whole or part is expressly required by the government.   <br>  <br> BK Trailer: Use of a standard Army trailer for the BK is highly desired, and the leading candidate is the M1061. This is a 16,000 lb. capacity lunette trailer with a 38 inch deck height.(The maximum height of the BK configured for transport cannot exceed 96 inches to meet the C-130 transportability requirements.) Testing of the M1061 is scheduled this year to evaluate its suitability for the BK. Some modifications of the trailer may be necessary to meet the BK application. It is likely that the M1061 or other standard Army trailer (with minimal modifications) will be specified. <br>  <br> Key BK requirements: <br>  <br>   C-130 and larger air transportability (maximum height 96 inches in transportation mode) Erectable by 4 persons in no greater than 30 minutes (not including site prep and leveling of platform) <br>   2-4 man portable appliance modules <br>   Cross country as well as highway transportability <br>   LMTV compatible (maximum rated towing capacity 12,000 pounds) <br>   Cooking capacity of 3 UGR-A meals of 300 servings 3 times per day  <br>   Food prep and cook time - maximum of 4 hours for all UGR-A menus. <br>   On board refrigeration (size maximized to fit within one 22 quote mark x27 quote mark  module position but no specific cavity capacity specified) <br>   Modular Hand wash sink and separate food preparation sink <br>   Minimum 4 well serving line with accommodations for an internal serving line <br>   All components including generator transported on board kitchen platform <br>   Active cooking and combustion product exhaust system that is downloadable with appliances <br>   Food holding capability <br>   Kitchen noise levels not to exceed 85 dBA, steady state average not to exceed 70 dBA <br>   Fully functional in environmental conditions from -25 F to +120 F. <br>   Ability to complex with a minimum of 1 additional BK back to back or multiple BKs daisy chained (current government concept only allows for back to back) <br>   Minimum appliance heat transfer efficiencies of: <br> o 30% for oven <br> o 36% for griddle and skillets <br>   Lighting meeting the requirements of MIL-STD-810 <br>   Will utilize an Army standard 3 kW generator that will be transported on the BK trailer. <br>   There will be a parasitic requirement of 700 watts to power the Food Sanitation Center (FSC). <br>   Designed for low cost and ease of maintenance <br>   Less than $150,000 manufactured cost desirable <br>  <br> All interested firms and manufacturers, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information. Information submissions should include available technology, product literature and illustrations, relevant company background/experience, experience designing systems to meet performance specifications and configuration control, experience developing technical manuals, existing quality assurance program, recent unit prices of the products presented in the vendor's response to include proposed costs for 1, 10, 50 and 100 systems,  NAICS Code and whether or not vendor is a small business (include number of employees). Information submissions must be received NLT 5:00 p.m. EST on August 1st 2015. Responses to this notice should be directed to: U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center, Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems, Food Service Equipment Team, ATTN: SFAE-CSS-E2 FS (Glenn Doucet), Natick MA  01760-5057, or email to glenn.a.doucet.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) seeks to identify current and emerging small arm systems, components, and support technologies that would provide significant, enduring, enhanced operational capability to dismounted infantry forces in the 2025+ time frame. We anticipate using this information to aid in the internal analysis and prioritization of future small arms research and development investments.
<p>This RFI seeks submissions from the private sector, to include firms and academic institutions, which will showcase technology which can be matured, integrated, and fielded into the next generation of dismounted squad weapon systems. Some technologies and subjects of immediate interest include, but are not limited to: munitions, munition effects, sensors, fire control, propulsion technology, energetics, weapon function and control, light weight solutions, automatic fire stabilization, and targeting technology. We are also interested in industry's ability to manufacture these items, and at what rate and cost, so as to ascertain the practicality of these technologies in the coming decades.</p>
<p>This RFI is not focused on off the shelf (COTS) solutions; nor is it focused on singular niche items that are intended for specific threats and venues. Rather, we are seeking broad based, innovative technologies which will enable the next generation of War-Fighter to hit: harder, farther, faster, and more often than they do now, with minimal consequence to logistics and maneuver. Final solutions must be well suited for the full array of ranges, environments, targets, and challenges which are projected for a 2025+ individual weapon system that will be carried and employed by the 2025+ dismounted squad member.</p>
<p>Abstract Format:</p>
<p>Submissions must be kept at modest size to facilitate processing. Respondents are encouraged to provide multiple submissions if covering multiple technologies. Submissions should include:</p>
<p>a) A one-page cover sheet that identifies the contact information including the title, organization, responder's points of contact (names, addresses, phone number, and e-mail addresses), and subject area selection to aid in processing.

Targeting<br />10. Weight<br />11. Sensors<br />12. Effects<br />13. Safety (e.g. noise Limits / recoil)<br />14. Fire Control</p>
<p>Letter Choices (Technical Maturity) (TRL):</p>
<p>Select the letter(s) which describe the current status of the technology.</p>
<p>A. Virtual Design Work Completed<br />B. Bench Firing (Proof of Concept) Tests Completed<br />E. Initial Prototype Work Completed<br />F. Ruggedized Prototype Work Completed<br />G. Current Commercial Product Sales (Low Rate Production Only)<br />H. Domestic Commercial Sales (More than XYZ cartridges produced per year) <br />I. International Commercial Sales<br />J. Foreign Military Product Sales</p>
<p>Roman Numeral Choices (Benefit):</p>
<p>Select the roman numeral(s) which best describe the range bracket most impacted by the submission.</p>
<p>I. Leap Ahead for Training<br />II. Leap Ahead for Close Quarter Battle (out to 50 meters)<br />III. Leap Ahead for Tactical Fire (out to 200 meters)<br />IV. Leap Ahead for Effective Range Fire (out to 600 meters)<br />V. Leap Ahead for Extended Range Fire (out to 1000 meters)<br />VI. Leap Ahead for Strategic Range Fire (Beyond 1000 meters)<br />VII. Leap Ahead for effects (More targets or Controlled targets)<br />VIII. Other</p>
<p>Submissions should also include:</p>
<p>b) A one to two page executive summary, summarizing key aspects of the submission. It should contain a concept of operations highlighting employment, versatility, function, and necessity. Leap ahead improvements should be clearly described in this summary. This is not part of the body.<br /><br />c) A ten page (or less) body describing any technical details of the submission. Figures, tables, and drawings are included in the ten page limit.</p>
<p>d) A five page (or less) summary of the operational utility of the submission can be included.</p>
<p>e) A five page (or less) summary of unit production cost; pertinent manufacturing details; and a discussion of what can be done to minimize the impact of the submission on the current logistics system can be provided.</p>
<p>f) Up to two additional pages of references can be included. This is not part of the body. Submissions are requested in electronic format as PDF (Portable Document Format) files (or equivalent). Submitters are also encouraged to, where relevant, fill out the associated excel template that was posted with this RFI. This information will be used to help ascertain the "state of the shelf".</p>
<p>Closing Thoughts</p>
<p>The level of effort which is associated with making decisions about next generation capability is not trivial. The intent of this request is to gather defensible evidence to insure that decision makers are fully informed of current and developing technologies at both the component and system level. This level of detail is necessary to substantiate and initiate future acquisition.</p>
<p>Other applications of small arms technology, such as vehicle mounted systems, play a meaningful role however they are not included in this RFI. This is a targeted query for squad weapons which have the potential to satisfy the missions covered by current infantry squad weapons. Additional RFI's are planned. Submitters are encouraged to respond to these, as they become available, and as appropriate to each RFI's wording and intent.</p>

<p><br />APPENDIX 1: Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>Background: The current platform, GoArmyEd, is a legacy system that provides a wide range of contractor-provided services to Army Continuing Education Division (ACED) to satisfy the educational requirements of Soldiers, Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) Scholarship Cadets, Early Commissioning Program (ECP) Second Lieutenants, and Department of the Army Civilians (DACs). GoArmyEd provides for educational programs and services for military personnel, i&not;&not;&not;ncluding Cadets, and professional development, training activities and events for Civilian personnel. Changes in the operating environment have produced a requirement for the Army to seek an efficient and cost effective enterprise solution to ensure that the post-secondary education needs and professional development of all eligible Army personnel are met. Objective is to obtain a flexible, real-time system that is adaptable to the Army's financial assistance needs.</p>
<p>ACED is a division of The Adjutant General Directorate (TAGD), U.S. Army Human Resources Command (HRC), DA G1. ACED's mission is to actively promote lifelong learning opportunities for Soldiers by providing and managing quality self-development education programs and services. Additional information on Army Continuing Education System (ACES) programs and services can be found at GoArmyEd.com.</p>
<p>GoArmyEd offers eligible students "anytime, anywhere" access to high quality education and training opportunities from accredited postsecondary and technical institutions and qualified training providers. GoArmyEd capitalizes on technology to provide 21st century education to the 21st century student. GoArmyEd provides equitable, virtual access to Tuition Assistance (TA) and professional development for users on a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (24/7) basis to assist the students in managing their own post-secondary education. GoArmyEd also provides one location for academic institutions and vendors to process enrollments, submit course grades, verify and prepare invoices for payment, and access centralized support for troubleshooting and information about Army Education and training processes and policies.</p>
<p>Under GoArmyEd the Army has a direct relationship with their partner schools through a Letter of Instruction (LOI) or Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). The Army plans to continue using a standardized agreement between the Army and its partner schools. Servicemembers Opportunity Colleges (SOC), as the Army's Academic Integrator, currently serves as primary interface and academic facilitator for all academic/higher education issues with GoArmyEd schools. The Army obtains SOC services through a contract with the Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES).</p>
<p><br />OBJECTIVE: Through this contract, ACED seeks to achieve the following objectives:</p>
<p>&bull; Create a virtual environment to sustain education services to Army military and civilian personnel, anytime and anywhere, thus allowing Army and Civilian personnel who are limited by location or technology, access to educational opportunities 24/7.<br />&bull; Allow Army and Civilian personnel virtual access to their complete education record and enable all users to perform many self-service actions that can promote efficiencies.<br />&bull; ACED, as a system owner, intends to obtain high quality, cost-effective and secure services necessary to meet its operational requirements by taking advantage of commercial marketplace offerings for educational, management and operation services accessed through the System. ACED recognizes that technology is rapidly evolving and advancing and desires that GoArmyEd services and features remain up-to-date with commercial equivalents. <br />&bull; Contractor shall develop, implement and maintain a system which is capable of incorporating new and emerging technologies and adaptable to incorporate new mission or policy requirements.<br />&bull; Establish ACED - contractor partnership to mutually satisfy Army's requirements and ensure a flexible, effective and efficient operations of the GoArmyEd system are maintained. <br />&bull; Ensure continuity of GoArmyEd System operations and user services during contract transition and implementation with no disruption to services or security risk exposure. <br />&bull; Acquire a system able to incorporate new users and new functionalities supporting ACED mission <br />&bull; Implement a performance-based acquisition.</p>
<p>The contractor shall develop, implement and maintain a modernized and flexible GoArmyEd system which incorporates emerging technologies with virtual capabilities that will be used by all 1) Soldiers who are eligible to receive TA and participate in other ACES programs and services provided by Army Education Centers/Offices such as counseling, academic and military testing, and basic skills; 2) eligible ROTC Scholarship Cadets and ECP Lieutenants to process their civilian college enrollments and to facilitate payment of their scholarship money to their academic institution; 3) eligible DAC employees to process their Army-funded professional development, education and training activities, and 4) other potential user groups as required, such as other Military Services (Air Force, Navy and/or Marines).

<DESC><p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) is issuing this sources-sought announcement as part of a market survey for X-band radar systems and technologies relevant to a future requirement for a shipboard self-defense radar system. This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP). NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME. Industry responses will be used as an input in the formulation of acquisition approaches and plans for appropriate future investments. The identification of radar systems and relevant subsystem technologies, including X-band active phased array antennas and low phase noise, exciters / frequency synthesizers that are relatively mature (TRL-6 or higher) are a major objective of this RFI.</p>
<p>A new X-band active array based radar system is envisioned to compliment both existing and emergent volume surveillance radar systems for horizon surveillance and tracking applications. A scalable radar design is envisioned to accommodate current and future mission requirements for multiple platforms. Although a radar system with multiple, fixed-face arrays is primarily of interest, a design that can additionally support single or back to back faces in a rotating variant is also of interest.</p>
<p>This sources sought is seeking interested parties that may have developed or are currently producing X-band active array radar systems or supporting active array antenna and low phase noise exciter / frequency synthesizer subsystems that have the potential to meet the emergent X-band radar requirements. This approach could include marinizing of land based, or possibly airborne, radars. Industry responses will be used as an input in the formulation of acquisition approaches and plans for appropriate future investments.</p>
<p>This sources sought is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>Advanced Development for HIV Vaccine
<SOLNBR>W81XWH-16-R-0006
<RESPDATE>110215
<CONTACT>Andrew W. Green, Phone 3013199279, Email Andrew.w.green17.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>Purpose<br />The HIV Vaccine Program Management Office (HIVV PMO) and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) are seeking information from companies, organizations, educational institutions and consortia (hereafter referred to as companies) with capabilities to support and perform vaccine clinical research activities primarily at its facilities in the US, Uganda, Tanzania, Nigeria, Kenya, Mozambique, and Thailand. The information being gathered will be used to assess the opportunity to issue a solicitation with the intent of completing clinical trials and supporting laboratory analysis in support of critical path studies leading to licensure of candidate vaccines. <br /><br />The primary focus of this Sources Sought is to gather information about organizations capable of conducting research and development of vaccines that can advance intramural HIV vaccine candidates from its Tech Base (safety and immunogenicity) to Advanced Development (efficacy and immunogenicity) programs. WRAIR is interested in companies with the capacity to support and conduct vaccine trials utilizing heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategies comprising combinations that can include, but are not limited to: (a) recombinant viral vectors (e.g. MVA, Ad26, Pox viruses, etc.); (b) recombinant protein immunogens + adjuvant;  and (c) HIV DNA plasmids.<br /><br />A secondary focus of this Sources Sought is to seek information about potential HIV vaccine technological enhancements. Examples of vaccine technological enhancements include but are not limited to any of the following: optimization of a protective immune response, innovations in formulation that improve stability and shelf life, efficacy of novel adjuvants, novel routes of delivery and identification of novel immunologic markers as correlates of protection. <br /><br />Background<br />In 1985, the United States military recognized the emerging HIV epidemic as a new threat to U.S. and allied forces worldwide. A military directive emerged to develop effective preventive measures to include prevention education, vaccine development and implementation of novel anti-viral therapies, and clinical management tools for the Department of Defense (DoD). Congress mandated the formation of an Army-led HIV/AIDS research unit in 1986.
<p>The HIV research program, centered at WRAIR, includes affiliated research sites in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Nigeria, Mozambique, and Thailand and collaborates with a wide variety of national and international research groups. The overarching program is collectively known as the U.S. Military HIV Research Program (MHRP). Attachment A: MHRP Slide Deck, gives a summary of the program efforts. Additional program and organization information can be accessed at www.hivresearch.org.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />MHRP has become an important and strategic partner in the international effort to develop a HIV vaccine. From its inception, MHRP has focused vaccine development efforts on the HIV variants that circulate in the developed (subtype B) and developing (non-subtype B) world, given its dual mission to develop a preventive HIV vaccine for U.S. military personnel and for the global community.</p>
<p><br />Since 1988, the U.S. Army has executed the vast majority of its diverse HIV research and development portfolio under a single cooperative agreement with a congressionally authorized non-profit organization. The U.S. Army anticipates transitioning this work to a contract vehicle within calendar year 2016.</p>
<p><br />Information Requested <br />The Government requests capabilities statements which shall be used to assess potential offerors with strong capabilities in developing and performing OCONUS clinical trials and HIV-vaccine specific research. Time permitting and based upon the capabilities statements, the Government may elect to conduct an industry day with the purpose of further honing the PWS.<br /> <br />Companies are invited to describe their experience and any on-going research efforts involving HIV vaccines, or similar products.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Your responses should include but are not limited to: <br />&nbsp; 1.	Company Information<br />&nbsp; 2.	Describe any vaccine platforms and antigen components you have directly supported. Include a brief synopsis of design and results of any Phase II and III trials.<br />&nbsp; 3.	Describe your experience operating/working outside the continental United States (OCONUS) to conduct clinical trials and vaccine R&amp;D:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.	Working in resource-limited countries including Africa and Asia<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.	Working with foreign governments to conduct clinical trails<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.	Working/collaborating with educational institutions OCONUS<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.

Working with advocacy groups, Community Advisory Boards, and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in the context of conducting clinical trials OCONUS<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f.	Working with foreign Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) in executing vaccine clinical trials <br />&nbsp; 4.	Describe OCONUS laboratory capabilities (or experience in developing these capabilities) to support clinical trials and conduct protocol related R&amp;D to determine biological basis for efficacy (e.g. immunological assays to determine correlates of protection, -omics to assess pathogen and host dynamics that influence protection, etc).<br />&nbsp; 5.	Describe your experience in supporting US-based management and oversight required to conduct complex international multi-site clinical trials. Include regulatory support, protocol development support, clinical monitoring, data analysis, project management support, IT support, financial analysis and reporting support.<br />&nbsp; 6.	Describe your experience in building capacity, technology transfer, and empowering international sites in host nations, particularly in resource-constrained countries. <br />&nbsp; 7.	Describe your experience obtaining specimens from clinical trials and the general nature of experiments your organization has conducted from those specimens.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Please include any comments relative to critical factors that your organization feels the government should consider for this effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Submitting a Response<br />This is a Sources Sought only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the DOD will take procurement action in this matter. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, applications, proposal abstracts or quotations. The purpose of this Sources Sought is to obtain knowledge and information to assess the current state of the science.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID: VA248-15-AP-12562	1A. PROJECT/TASK No. N/A	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$120,000.00
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE: This acquisition is a
request for Other Than Full and Open Competition for the procurement of Textile Care Analysis Annual Software Support for Plant Management Systems monitoring system at the Bay Pines VA. Textile Care Annual Software Support includes supporting the network system which was designed and developed by ICS. The Industrial Laundry Plant Management System (ILPMS) was composed of several programs that interface not only to each other but to other locations within the entire VISN network. Additionally, the ILPMS shall be a standalone system that is deployed on a separate plant network and utilizing a dedicate SQL Server, and shall not depend on any other network components that are deployed within the Laundry production facility. Servers are located at the Laundry facility at Bldg. #13, Bay Pines VA Healthcare System. 
3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED: ICS is the sole proprietary copyrighted Textile Care Analysis Software and support. There are no other authorized resellers.
4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES: ICS designed and developed the software and owns the proprietary copyrights and is the sole source provider for the Textile Care Analysis Software support.
5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED: Market Research was conducted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), SAM, NAC tools, GSA Advantage, and VetBiz. Research revealed that ICS owns the proprietary copyrights and is the sole source provider for Textile Care Analysis Software Support. No other sources are available to satisfy the needs of the government.
6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>The Aviation Development Directorate / Aviation Applied Technology Directorate seeks to procure specified components for the Airborne Mission Networking (AMN) project Technology Application Office (TAPO).  The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) Contracting Division, Army Contracting Command (ACC), intends to award on a sole-source basis in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(i), Soliciting from a Single Source, further utilizing FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(2)(i)(A), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The award will be made with East Coast Microwave Sales & Distribution located at 70 Tower Office Park; Woburn, Massachusetts 01801-2113. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-83. The solicitation number is W911W6-16-P-0003 and is NOT issued as a Request For Quotation (RFQ). The associated NAICS code is 423690 and the small business size standard is 100.  This is not a set-aside requirement.  The proposed contract action will be a commercial item purchase order in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The proposed effort is for procurement of the following: Airborne Mission Network (AMN) and Host Platform equipment, including QTY=1: 2,000 foot long Semflex RF cable- continuous spool (Manufacturer: Cinch Connectivity Solutions, PN: HP305); QTY=110 Semflex connectors (Manufacturer: Cinch Connectivity Solutions, PN: 20692-111); QTY=482 Semflex connectors (Manufacturer: Cinch Connectivity Solutions, PN: 20684-111), QTY=139 Semflex connectors (Manufacturer: Cinch Connectivity Solutions, PN: 20683-111); QTY=110 Semflex connectors (Manufacturer: Cinch Connectivity Solutions, PN: 20696-111); QTY=66 Semflex connectors (Manufacturer: Cinch Connectivity Solutions, PN: 20677-111) for installations on aircraft in support of the AMN Program.   <br>  <br> A US Army prototype design has been developed and is currently under Air Worthiness Review (AWR), utilizing the following part numbers (HP305, 20692-111, 20684-111, 20683-111, 20696-111, and 20677-111).  The AMN prototypes undergoing Redstone Test Center testing and flight testing on aircraft are already heavily invested in Semflex RF cable technology. The Semflex RF cabling are unique components that meet the AMN system requirements of compact size and durability and meet the MIL-SPEC requirements of this contract effort.  Therefore, this requirement can only be fulfilled with Semflex RF cabling.  For Semflex RF cabling, Cinch Connectivity Solutions is the only manufacturer that will currently manufacture bulk cable and connectors for the 1800 MHz frequency range.  In addition, only one source is known that can deliver the bulk Semflex RF cable and separate connectors (not as a pre-terminated assembly), and that is East Coast Microwave.  Alternative pre-terminated assemblies cannot be routed through the aircraft structure without major airframe modifications which would add significant risk to the program and adversely affect the timeline for program execution.  Only the items listed above will be acceptable, and no substitute or like items will be considered for award.  Delivery, Inspection, Acceptance and F.O.B. Point are at Destination, Fort Eustis, Virginia 23604.   <br>  <br> The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition without addenda. Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items Alternate I, with their offer.

The full text of the clauses or provisions may be accessed electronically at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.  <br>  <br> This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive quotes/proposals.  No request for quotes/proposals will be posted. Interested sources may identify interest and their capability to respond to the requirement.  The Government will review and consider all capability statements received within the closing date set in this notice.

<DESC><br />This notice is a synopsis in accordance with FAR 5.101 for a proposed contract action to Contract W31P4Q-11-C-0309 published at least 15 days before the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations and a solicitation will not be issued for this requirement. <br /><br />The Army Contracting Command - Redstone Arsenal intends to award a modification to the existing Improved Bradley Acquisition Subsystem (IBAS) Engineering Services (ES) contract which will extend the contract period of performance from 1 March 2016 through 30 September 2016. The extension will provide for the continuation of ES in support of fielded IBAS, components and support equipment.<br />&nbsp;
<p>This seven month extension of services is accomplished pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This seven month extension is intended to be awarded to DRS NIS LLC under FAR 6.302-1 as award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement.</p>
<p>This extension is necessary to allow time for the limited competition acquisition of the follow-on contract.</p>
<p>The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this option to extend services. Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be e-mailed to Barbara.j.balaban.civ@mail.mil and dorphelia.b.foster.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed an Electric Field Imaging (EFI) system that is the only noncontact method capable of quantitatively measuring the magnitude and direction of electrostatic fields in near- and far-field applications. Based on low-cost, commercially available components, the EFI system uses measurement of very low-current, human-safe electric fields to construct a three-dimensional image of objects and people based on their dielectric properties. This platform technology, originally developed for measurement of the efficacy of electrical shielding around cables, could be optimized for a variety of applications, including medical imaging, security and detection, weather and natural disaster prediction, and nondestructive evaluation of composites and insulators. The EFI system has the potential to offer a lower-cost, portable, and safer alternative to the imaging systems currently used in these applications.  NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially. To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to <a href="mailto:LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov">LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov </a> with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide the nature of your interest in the technology along with a brief background of your company. For more information about licensing other NASA-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Technology Transfer Portal at <A HREF="http://technology.nasa.gov/">http://technology.nasa.gov/ </A>  . These responses are provided to members of NASA Langleys Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development OSACB for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a Floating Ultrasonic System for improved nondestructive testing. Most ultrasonic scanners require an external liquid coupling agent (e.g., water, gel, oil) to make a good contact between the probe and the surface being scanned. However, some surfaces are sensitive to moisture and/or contamination created by these agents. NASA created the Floating Ultrasonic System to address this issue. NASAs technology is based on a momentary touching scheme where a vibrating probe comes in contact with the structure for fractions of a second while performing measurements, giving the probe the appearance of floating across a surface. The design allows for the easy movement of the probe over surfaces being inspected without the use of a liquid couplant between the probe and the surface. Initial test results have also shown NASA's system to have comparable performance to liquid-couplant-based, ultrasonic scanners. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a process for fabricating carbon nanotube (CNT) structural nanocomposites that brings CNT-based composites closer to realizing their potential for structural applications. Conventional methods fail to properly wet CNTs within the epoxy matrix, due to high resin viscosity, resulting in poor infiltration and reduced load transfer between the CNTs and matrix. The NASA process, resistive heating assisted epoxy infiltration (RHAEI), uses the CNTs electrical resistance to generate heat which reduces epoxy resin viscosity, for greater CNT wetting and adhesion. Mechanical properties are significantly improved compared to conventional methods. NASA's process has been demonstrated to offer 50% improvement in strength and elastic modulus, with mechanical properties competitive with structural carbon fiber composites. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially.

The container size accommodates varying sizes for nominal maximum size of aggregate of 12.5-32mm. ERDC-CERL intends to sole source this acquisition in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) to Germann Instruments as it is the only company that offers a product meeting the above specifications.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Oct 2014), applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides a capabilities statement to include evidence of being a telecommunications company which has the ability to deliver Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 -Local Communication Services.<br />2a. This subfactor is met when the Offeror submits a sound approach for supporting local communication services in a detailed SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend. The diagram and legend should clearly illustrate the Offeror's capability to meet all SOW and site-specific Appendix 10 requirements. Reference the Appendix 10, para. 10.13 attachment A, "Traditional Legacy" and attachment B, "Utilizing SIP Trunking", or Offerors may use a combination of both attachments to submit the Offeror's diagram. Provide the requested diagram and legend using these formats or a similar format.</p>
<p>2b. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides a written description of each service that will be delivered in the site-specific diagram and the methodology of their delivery.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Evidence of Agreements.</p>
<p>This subfactor is met when the Offeror states whether your company is providing a proposal as a Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC). If providing a proposal as a CLEC for ANY and/or ALL services, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Dec 2014), which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Oct 2014), applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability.</p>
<p>This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides a capabilities statement to include evidence of being a telecommunications company which has the ability to deliver Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID) and number portability at the Government demarcation point at the site specified in the Appendix 10 attachment, page 1.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 -Local Communication Services. <br />2a. This subfactor is met when the Offeror submits a sound approach for supporting local communication services in a detailed SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend. The diagram and legend should clearly illustrate the Offeror's capability to meet all SOW and site-specific Appendix 10 requirements. Reference the Appendix 10, para. 10.13 attachment A, "Traditional Legacy" and attachment B, "Utilizing SIP Trunking", or Offerors may use a combination of both attachments to submit the Offeror's diagram. Provide the requested diagram and legend using these formats or a similar format.</p>
<p>2b. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides a written description of each service that will be delivered in the site-specific diagram and the methodology of their delivery.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Evidence of Agreements.</p>
<p>This subfactor is met when the Offeror states whether your company is providing a proposal as a Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC). If providing a proposal as a CLEC for ANY and/or ALL services, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

An "established catalog price" is a price included in a catalog, price list, schedule, or other form that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or the offeror, is either published or otherwise available for inspection by customers, and states prices at which sales currently, or were last, made to a significant number of buyers constituting the general public.

(b) Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services. If the offeror certifies to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision, and the Contracting Officer determines in accordance with FAR 22.1003-4(d)(3) that the Service Contract Labor Standards statute- (1) Will not apply to this offeror, then the Service Contract Labor Standards clause in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; or (2) Will apply to this offeror, then the clause at FAR 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Labor Standards to Contracts for Certain Services-Requirements, in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offer, and the offeror may be provided an opportunity to submit a new offer on that basis. (c) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision-    (1) The clause of this solicitation at 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Labor Standards to Contracts for Certain Services-Requirements, will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; and (2) The offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible if the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation. (d) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror, if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (a) of this provision or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (c) of this provision.

(c)  The Contractor shall allow as many personnel as practicable to remain on the job to help the successor maintain the continuity and consistency of the services required by this contract.  The Contractor also shall disclose necessary personnel records and allow the successor to conduct on-site interviews with these employees.  If selected employees are agreeable to the change, the Contractor shall release them at a mutually agreeable date and negotiate transfer of their earned fringe benefits to the successor. (d)  The Contractor shall be reimbursed for all reasonable phase-in, phase-out costs (i.e., costs incurred within the agreed period after contract expiration that result from phase-in, phase-out operations) and a fee (profit) not to exceed a pro rata portion of the fee (profit) under this contract.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<DESC>The SCW is designed for Navy enterprise organizations in support of Navy and Joint operations. Participants expect to gain expertise in SC and apply this knowledge within their various commands. Expertise includes knowledge about organizational change and leadership, strategic communication planning, organizational communication, new media, development and analysis of narratives, crisis communication and metrics. Participants who attend the SCW expect to acquire cutting-edge SC knowledge that is grounded in the latest research. They also expect to learn best SC practices from both the private and public sector. In addition to attaining new knowledge, they expect to take away an actionable product that uses a variety of analytical tools and procedures.
 The desired outcome of the SCW is to develop an organizational culture that recognizes the value of communication and effectively integrates strategic communication into policy development, operational planning, execution and assessment to advance DoD and national interests. The desired outcome is accomplished in two ways: 1) instruction in SC principles and processes; and, 2) facilitation of individual teams in developing individualized SC plans and processes for their unique organization and issues.

<p>Sensitive Information Required Special Contract Terms (MARCH 2015) <br />SAFEGUARDING OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION (MAR 2015)</p>
<p>(a) Applicability. This clause applies to [ENTITY NAME], its subcontractors, and Contractor employees (hereafter referred to collectively as "Contractor"). The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in all subcontracts.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause-<br />"Personally Identifiable Information (PII)" means information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, or biometric records, either alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, or mother's maiden name. The definition of PII is not anchored to any single category of information or technology. Rather, it requires a case-by-case assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified. In performing this assessment, it is important for an agency to recognize that non-personally identifiable information can become personally identifiable information whenever additional information is made publicly available-in any medium and from any source-that, combined with other available information, could be used to identify an individual.</p>
<p>PII is a subset of sensitive information. Examples of PII include, but are not limited to: name, date of birth, mailing address, telephone number, Social Security number (SSN), email address, zip code, account numbers, certificate/license numbers, vehicle identifiers including license plates, uniform resource locators (URLs), static Internet protocol addresses, biometric identifiers such as fingerprint, voiceprint, iris scan, photographic facial images, or any other unique identifying number or characteristic, and any information where it is reasonably foreseeable that the information will be linked with other information to identify the individual.</p>
<p>"Sensitive Information" is defined in HSAR clause 3052.204-71, Contractor Employee Access, as any information, which if lost, misused, disclosed, or, without authorization is accessed, or modified, could adversely affect the national or homeland security interest, the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under section 552a of Title 5, United States Code (the Privacy Act), but which has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense, homeland security or foreign policy. This definition includes the following categories of information:</p>
<p>(1) Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) as set out in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 (Title II, Subtitle B, of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, 196 Stat. 2135), as amended, the implementing regulations thereto (Title 6, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 29) as amended, the applicable PCII Procedures Manual, as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the PCII Program Manager or his/her designee);</p>
<p>(2) Sensitive Security Information (SSI), as defined in Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1520, as amended, "Policies and Procedures of Safeguarding and Control of SSI," as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the Assistant Secretary for the Transportation Security Administration or his/her designee);</p>
<p>(3) Information designated as "For Official Use Only," which is unclassified information of a sensitive nature and the unauthorized disclosure of which could adversely impact a person's privacy or welfare, the conduct of Federal programs, or other programs or operations essential to the national or homeland security interest; and</p>
<p>(4) Any information that is designated "sensitive" or subject to other controls, safeguards or protections in accordance with subsequently adopted homeland security information handling procedures.</p>
<p>"Sensitive Information Incident" is an incident that includes the known, potential, or suspected exposure, loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access or attempted access of any Government system, Contractor system, or sensitive information.</p>
<p>"Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII)" is a subset of PII, which if lost, compromised or disclosed without authorization, could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual. Some forms of PII are sensitive as stand-alone elements. Examples of such PII include: Social Security numbers (SSN), driver's license or state identification number, Alien Registration Numbers (A-number), financial account number, and biometric identifiers such as fingerprint, voiceprint, or iris scan. Additional examples include any groupings of information that contain an individual's name or other unique identifier plus one or more of the following elements:</p>
<p>(1) Truncated SSN (such as last 4 digits)<br />(2) Date of birth (month, day, and year)<br />(3) Citizenship or immigration status<br />(4) Ethnic or religious affiliation<br />(5) Sexual orientation<br />(6) Criminal History<br />(7) Medical Information<br />(8) System authentication information such as mother's maiden name, account passwords or personal identification numbers (PIN)</p>
<p>Other PII may be "sensitive" depending on its context, such as a list of employees and their performance ratings or an unlisted home address or phone number. In contrast, a business card or public telephone directory of agency employees contains PII but is not sensitive.</p>
<p>(c) Authorities. The Contractor shall follow all current versions of Government policies and guidance accessible at http://www.dhs.gov/dhs-security-and-training-requirements-contractors, or available upon request from the Contracting Officer, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>(1) DHS Management Directive 11042.1 Safeguarding Sensitive But Unclassified (for Official Use Only) Information<br />(2) DHS Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300A<br />(3) DHS 4300A Sensitive Systems Handbook and Attachments<br />(4) DHS Security Authorization Process Guide<br />(5) DHS Handbook for Safeguarding Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information<br />(6) DHS Instruction Handbook 121-01-007 Department of Homeland Security Personnel Suitability and Security Program<br />(7) DHS Information Security Performance Plan (current fiscal year)<br />(8) DHS Privacy Incident Handling Guidance <br />(9) Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules accessible at http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/standards.html<br />(10) National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-53 Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations accessible at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html<br />(11) NIST Special Publication 800-88 Guidelines for Media Sanitization accessible at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html<br />(d) Handling of Sensitive Information. Contractor compliance with this clause, as well as the policies and procedures described below, is required.</p>
<p>(1) Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policies and procedures on Contractor personnel security requirements are set forth in various Management Directives (MDs), Directives, and Instructions. MD 11042.1, Safeguarding Sensitive But Unclassified (For Official Use Only) Information describes how Contractors must handle sensitive but unclassified information. DHS uses the term "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" to identify sensitive but unclassified information that is not otherwise categorized by statute or regulation. Examples of sensitive information that are categorized by statute or regulation are PCII, SSI, etc. The DHS Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300A and the DHS 4300A Sensitive Systems Handbook provide the policies and procedures on security for Information Technology (IT) resources. The DHS Handbook for Safeguarding Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information provides guidelines to help safeguard SPII in both paper and electronic form. DHS Instruction Handbook 121-01-007 Department of <br />Homeland Security Personnel Suitability and Security Program establishes procedures, program responsibilities, minimum standards, and reporting protocols for the DHS Personnel Suitability and Security Program.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not use or redistribute any sensitive information processed, stored, and/or transmitted by the Contractor except as specified in the contract.</p>
<p>(3) All Contractor employees with access to sensitive information shall execute DHS Form 11000-6, Department of Homeland Security Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), as a condition of access to such information. The Contractor shall maintain signed copies of the NDA for all employees as a record of compliance. The Contractor shall provide copies of the signed NDA to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) no later than two (2) days after execution of the form.</p>
<p>(4) The Contractor's invoicing, billing, and other recordkeeping systems maintained to support financial or other administrative functions shall not maintain SPII. It is acceptable to maintain in these systems the names, titles and contact information for the COR or other Government personnel associated with the administration of the contract, as needed.</p>
<p>(e) Authority to Operate. The Contractor shall not input, store, process, output, and/or transmit sensitive information within a Contractor IT system without an Authority to Operate (ATO) signed by the Headquarters or Component CIO, or designee, in consultation with the Headquarters or Component Privacy Officer. Unless otherwise specified in the ATO letter, the ATO is valid for three (3) years. The Contractor shall adhere to current Government policies, procedures, and guidance for the Security Authorization (SA) process as defined below.</p>
<p><br />(1) Complete the Security Authorization process. The SA process shall proceed according to the DHS Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300A (Version 11.0, April 30, 2014), or any successor publication, DHS 4300A Sensitive Systems Handbook (Version 9.1, July 24, 2012), or any successor publication, and the Security Authorization Process Guide including templates. <br />(i) Security Authorization Process Documentation. SA documentation shall be developed using the Government provided Requirements Traceability Matrix and Government security documentation templates. SA documentation consists of the following: Security Plan, Contingency Plan, Contingency Plan Test Results, Configuration Management Plan, Security Assessment Plan, Security Assessment Report, and Authorization to Operate Letter. Additional documents that may be required include a Plan(s) of Action and Milestones and Interconnection Security Agreement(s). During the development of SA documentation, the Contractor shall submit a signed SA package, validated by an independent third party, to the COR for acceptance by the Headquarters or Component CIO, or designee, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of operation of the IT system. The Government is the final authority on the compliance of the SA package and may limit the number of resubmissions of a modified SA package. Once the ATO has been accepted by the Headquarters or Component CIO, or designee, the Contracting Officer shall incorporate the ATO into the contract as a compliance document. The Government's acceptance of the ATO does not alleviate the Contractor's responsibility to ensure the IT system controls are implemented and operating effectively.<br />(ii) Independent Assessment. Contractors shall have an independent third party validate the security and privacy controls in place for the system(s). The independent third party shall review and analyze the SA package, and report on technical, operational, and management level deficiencies as outlined in NIST Special Publication 800-53 Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations. The Contractor shall address all deficiencies before submitting the SA package to the Government for acceptance.<br />(iii) Support the completion of the Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA) as needed. As part of the SA process, the Contractor may be required to support the Government in the completion of the PTA. The requirement to complete a PTA is triggered by the creation, use, modification, upgrade, or disposition of a Contractor IT system that will store, maintain and use PII, and must be renewed at least every three (3) years. Upon review of the PTA, the DHS Privacy Office determines whether a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and/or Privacy Act System of Records Notice (SORN), or modifications thereto, are required. The Contractor shall provide all support necessary to assist the Department in completing the PIA in a timely manner and shall ensure that project management plans and schedules include time for the completion of the PTA, PIA, and SORN (to the extent required) as milestones. Support in this context includes responding timely to requests for information from the Government about the use, access, storage, and maintenance of PII on the Contractor's system, and providing timely review of relevant compliance documents for factual accuracy. Information on the DHS privacy compliance process, including PTAs, PIAs, and SORNs, is accessible at http://www.dhs.gov/privacy-compliance.</p>
<p>(2) Renewal of ATO. Unless otherwise specified in the ATO letter, the ATO shall be renewed every three (3) years. The Contractor is required to update its SA package as part of the ATO renewal process. The Contractor shall update its SA package by one of the following methods: (1) Updating the SA documentation in the DHS automated information assurance tool for acceptance by the Headquarters or Component CIO, or designee, at least 90 days before the ATO expiration date for review and verification of security controls; or (2) Submitting an updated SA package directly to the COR for approval by the Headquarters or Component CIO, or designee, at least 90 days before the ATO expiration date for review and verification of security controls. The 90 day review process is independent of the system production date and therefore it is important that the Contractor build the review into project schedules. The reviews may include onsite visits that involve physical or logical inspection of the Contractor environment to ensure controls are in place.</p>
<p>(3) Security Review. The Government may elect to conduct random periodic reviews to ensure that the security requirements contained in this contract are being implemented and enforced. The Contractor shall afford DHS, the Office of the Inspector General, and other Government organizations access to the Contractor's facilities, installations, operations, documentation, databases and personnel used in the performance of this contract. The Contractor shall, through the Contracting Officer and COR, contact the Headquarters or Component CIO, or designee, to coordinate and participate in review and inspection activity by Government organizations external to the DHS. Access shall be provided, to the extent necessary as determined by the Government, for the Government to carry out a program of inspection, investigation, and audit to safeguard against threats and hazards to the integrity, availability and confidentiality of Government data or the function of computer systems used in performance of this contract and to preserve evidence of computer crime.</p>
<p>(4) Continuous Monitoring. All Contractor-operated systems that input, store, process, output, and/or transmit sensitive information shall meet or exceed the continuous monitoring requirements identified in the Fiscal Year 2014 DHS Information Security Performance Plan, or successor publication. The plan is updated on an annual basis. The Contractor shall also store monthly continuous monitoring data at its location for a period not less than one year from the date the data is created. The data shall be encrypted in accordance with FIPS 140-2 Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules and shall not be stored on systems that are shared with other commercial or Government entities. The Government may elect to perform continuous monitoring and IT security scanning of Contractor systems from Government tools and infrastructure.</p>
<p>(5) Revocation of ATO. In the event of a sensitive information incident, the Government may suspend or revoke an existing ATO (either in part or in whole). If an ATO is suspended or revoked in accordance with this provision, the Contracting Officer may direct the Contractor to take additional security measures to secure sensitive information. These measures may include restricting access to sensitive information on the Contractor IT system under this contract. Restricting access may include disconnecting the system processing, storing, or transmitting the sensitive information from the Internet or other networks or applying additional security controls.</p>
<p>(6) Federal Reporting Requirements. Contractors operating information systems on behalf of the Government or operating systems containing sensitive information shall comply with Federal reporting requirements. Annual and quarterly data collection will be coordinated by the Government. Contractors shall provide the COR with requested information within three (3) business days of receipt of the request. Reporting requirements are determined by the Government and are defined in the Fiscal Year 2014 DHS Information Security Performance Plan, or successor publication. The Contractor shall provide the Government with all information to fully satisfy Federal reporting requirements for Contractor systems.</p>
<p>(f) Sensitive Information Incident Reporting Requirements.</p>
<p>(1) All known or suspected sensitive information incidents shall be reported to the Headquarters or Component Security Operations Center (SOC) within one hour of discovery in accordance with 4300A Sensitive Systems Handbook Incident Response and Reporting requirements. When notifying the Headquarters or Component SOC, the Contractor shall also notify the Contracting Officer, COR, Headquarters or Component Privacy Officer, and US-CERT using the contact information identified in the contract. If the incident is reported by phone or the Contracting Officer's email address is not immediately available, the Contractor shall contact the Contracting Officer immediately after reporting the incident to the Headquarters or Component SOC. The Contractor shall not include any sensitive information in the subject or body of any e-mail. To transmit sensitive information, the Contractor shall use FIPS 140-2 Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules compliant encryption methods to protect sensitive information in attachments to email. Passwords shall not be communicated in the same email as the attachment. A sensitive information incident shall not, by itself, be interpreted as evidence that the Contractor has failed to provide adequate information security safeguards for sensitive information, or has otherwise failed to meet the requirements of the contract. <br />(2) If a sensitive information incident involves PII or SPII, in addition to the reporting requirements in 4300A Sensitive Systems Handbook Incident Response and Reporting, Contractors shall also provide as many of the following data elements that are available at the time the incident is reported, with any remaining data elements provided within 24 hours of submission of the initial incident report:<br />(i) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS); <br />(ii) Contract numbers affected unless all contracts by the company are affected;<br />(iii) Facility CAGE code if the location of the event is different than the prime contractor location;<br />(iv) Point of contact (POC) if different than the POC recorded in the System for Award Management (address, position, telephone, email);<br />(v) Contracting Officer POC (address, telephone, email);<br />(vi) Contract clearance level;<br />(vii) Name of subcontractor and CAGE code if this was an incident on a subcontractor network;<br />(viii) Government programs, platforms or systems involved;<br />(ix) Location(s) of incident;<br />(x) Date and time the incident was discovered;<br />(xi) Server names where sensitive information resided at the time of the incident, both at the Contractor and subcontractor level;<br />(xii) Description of the Government PII and/or SPII contained within the system;<br />(xiii) Number of people potentially affected and the estimate or actual number of records exposed and/or contained within the system; and<br />(xiv) Any additional information relevant to the incident.</p>

The Contractor agrees to continue to provide sufficient personnel to perform critical tasks already in operation or scheduled, and shall be guided by the instructions issued by the Contracting Officer or the Contracting Officer's Representative.

<p>J. INTERRELATIONSHIP OF ASSOCIATE CONTRACTORS. The TSA may enter into contractual agreements with other Contractors (i.e., "Associate Contractors") in order to fulfill requirements separate from the work to be performed under this contract, yet having a relationship to performance under this contract. It is expected that contractors working under TSA contracts will have to work together under certain conditions in order to achieve a common solution for TSA. The Contractor may be required to coordinate with other such Contractor(s) through the cognizant Contracting Officer (CO) and/or designated representative in providing suitable, non-conflicting technical and/or management interface and in avoidance of duplication of effort. Information on deliverables provided under separate contracts may, at the discretion of the TSA and/or other Government agencies, be provided to such other Contractor(s) for the purpose of such work.</p>
<p>Where the Contractor and an associate Contractor fail to agree upon action to be taken in connection with their respective responsibilities, each Contractor shall promptly bring the matters to the attention of the cognizant CO and furnish the Contractor's recommendations for a solution. The Contractor shall not be relieved of its obligations to make timely deliveries or be entitled to any other adjustment because of failure of the Contractor and its associate to promptly refer matters to the CO or because of failure to implement CO directions.</p>
<p>Where the Contractor and Associate Contractors are required to collaborate to deliver a service; the Government will designate, in writing and prior to the definition of the task, to both Contractors, a "lead Contractor" for the project. In these cases the Associate Contractors shall also be contractually required to coordinate and collaborate with the Contractor. TSA will facilitate the mutual execution of Non-Disclosure Agreements.</p>
<p>K. PERSONAL SERVICES<br />"Personal services" are those in which contractor personnel would appear to be, in effect, Government employees via the direct supervision and oversight by Government employees. No personal services shall be performed under this contract. No Contractor employee will be directly supervised by a Government employee. All individual Contractor employee assignments, and daily work direction, shall be given by the applicable employee supervisor of the Contractor. If the Contractor believes any Government action or communication has been given that would create a personal services relationship between the Government and any Contractor employee, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of this communication or action.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall not perform any inherently Governmental actions as defined by FAR 7.500. No Contractor employee shall hold him or herself out to be a Government employee, agent, or representative. No Contractor employee shall state orally or in writing at any time that he or she is acting on behalf of the Government. In all communications in connection with this contract, Contractor employees shall identify themselves as Contractor employees and specify the name of the company for which they work. In all communications with other Government Contractors in connection with this contract, the Contractor employee shall state that they have no authority to in any way change any contract and that if the other Contractor believes this communication to be a direction to change their contract, they should notify the Contracting Officer for that contract and not carry out the direction until a clarification has been issued by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure that all of its employees working on this contract are informed of the substance of this clause. Nothing in this special contract requirement shall limit the Government's rights in any way under any other term of the contract, including those related to the Government's right to inspect and accept the services to be performed under this contract. The substance of this special contract requirement shall be included in all subcontracts at any tier.</p>

<DESC>The project consists of the dredging of portions of the Auxiliary Channels of the Thimble Shoal Federal Navigation Channel and the placement of the beach-quality dredged material along the Chesapeake Bay shoreline of the City of Norfolk, VA between the Little Creek Federal Navigation Channel and the terminal groin at the Tip of Willoughby Spit. The work shall be performed by a hopper dredge with 1,200,000 cubic yards of beach-quality dredged material transported and placed along the shoreline to provide for a protective beach berm with an average width of 60 feet constructed at an elevation of 5 feet above mean low water [3.5 feet, North American Vertical Datum, 1988 (NAVD 88)], with a foreshore slope of one on 20 extending to the natural bottom along the entire 7.3-mile shoreline where an adequate berm does not presently exist. The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract using INVITATION FOR BID WITH PRE-AWARD SURVEY and procedures outlined in FAR 36 and FAR<br />14. Pre-award survey will determine contractors' responsibility in accordance with FAR 9.104 and 9.106.
<p>Bidders will be evaluated on both pre-award survey and conformance to the solicitation and price. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all Bids; and to award the contract to other than the lowest total price and to award to the bidder submitting the lowest bid determined by the Government to be responsible. The contract duration is 365 calendar days. The magnitude of construction is estimated to be between $10,000,000.00 to $25,000,000.00. The solicitation will be posted on/about 16 October 2015. The receipt date for Bids is&nbsp;20 November 2015 by 2:00 p.m. NAICS CODE 237990 ($27.5M) applies to this procurement. Bid bonds will be required with bid submittals. Search on W91236% for solicitations issued by Norfolk District. No hard copies will be available.

<p>(SAM) database in order to obtain access to FEDBIZOPPS. It is incumbent upon vendors to monitor FEDBIZOPPS for the release of the solicitation, specification, drawings, and all subsequent amendments. SAM Registration must also be ACTIVE and current to be eligible for contract award. Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements may be obtained by calling 1-866-606-8220 or via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov. Lack of registration in the SAM database will prevent access to FEDBIZOPPS and will make a Bidder ineligible for award. NOTE: Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) apply to this solicitation. With ORCA, vendors have the ability to enter and maintain representations and certification information, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov; therefore, vendors no longer have to submit representations and certifications with bid. Instead, this solicitation contains a single provision that will allow vendor to either certify that all representations and certification in ORCA are current, complete, and accurate as of the date of signature, or list any changes.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The following pertains to this Amendment:


QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q1.  If these requirements are currently or have been being performed under a contract, who is the Contractor?  What is the contract number?  What is the value?

A1.  The incumbent contractor is Resolution Consultants, Contract N62470-11-D-8013, with an estimated contract amount of $200,000,000.

Q2.  We have a large IDIQ task order with multiple activities/deliverables.  The overall task order is 95% complete. While final versions have been issued for most of the deliverables, some deliverables have only been issued as draft versions.  Does this task order meet the definition of a substantially completed project?

A2.
  Yes.

Q3.  The submission requirements state that electronic copies of the SF 330 are to be provided as a Microsoft file (.doc or .xls format).  These are file extensions for Microsoft Office 2003 and 1997 versions.  May we submit our SF330 in the latest Microsoft Office 2013 version?  

A3.  Any version of Microsoft Office that is compatible with Microsoft Office 2010 is acceptable.

Q4.  Since Microsoft files may appear different when viewed on different systems (e.g., pagination may vary), may we instead provide the electronic copies as an Adobe PDF file to ensure consistency in appearance and page count from one system to another?

A4.  Graphics/photos may be submitted in .pdf; however, the text must be submitted in a Microsoft file (Word or Excel) that is compatible with Microsoft Office 2010.
 

Q5.  Does the requirement for 12-pitch font (or larger) apply to all parts of the submittal, or may we use a smaller font for tables, figures, headers, and footers as long as it is legible?

A5.  No, please use at least 12-point font for all parts of the submittal.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

As used in this clause:Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.Inverted Domestic Corporation.

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.(c) Special rules. <BR> <BR>The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p>TITLE: Measurement and Signatures Intelligence Exploitation (MASINT-X)</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-12-02</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The technical objectives of this BAA are to research innovative, disruptive technologies and methods in Measurement and Signatures Intelligence Exploitation (MASINT-X). The MASINT-X BAA seeks significant advances in the exploitation and reporting of five MASINT sub-disciplines.<br /><br />The five MASINT sub-disciplines of interest to this solicitation include: <br />1. Electro-Optical - Technologies for the detection and exploitation of relevant phenomena by electro-optical sensors to include laser intelligence (LASINT), Overhead Non-imaging Infrared (ONIR), Thermal IR (TIR), and spectroscopy. <br /><br />2. RADAR - Technologies to include Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Inverse SAR, Line of Sight (LOS), Over the Horizon (OTH), and bi-static radar.</p>
<p>3. Materials - Technologies to collect, characterize and identify materials, point of origin by remote or close-in means to include nuclear materials, biological threats to include the identification of infectious agents of military importance. Investigations may include improvements in the dissemination of intelligence information to medical personnel through improvements in bioinformatics and data management systems.</p>
<p>4. Radio Frequency - Seek technology to collect, process, and exploit signals intelligence from Ultra Wideband (UWB), Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP), High Power Microwave (HPM), Unintended RF Emissions (URE or RINT) threats.</p>
<p>5. Geophysical - Seek new capabilities for persistent surveillance of areas of interest using seismic, magnetic, acoustic, hydro-acoustic or multi-disciplinary approaches.<br />The innovative MASINT-X technology supporting the sub-disciplines above may require the planning and conducting of field tests to demonstrate the advancement in the specific technology. This includes preparing test plans; acquiring, transporting, deploying, and operating all equipment; operating and measuring ground truth sources; evaluating and monitoring test execution; and documenting all test results.</p>
<p>The MASINT-X capabilities will be required to interface and report to operational systems such as (but not limited to) Distributed Common Ground Systems (DCGS), Defense Information &amp; Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E), and Multimedia Analysis &amp; Archive System (MAAS). The goal of interfacing with these operational systems is twofold; first, provide a more cohesive and complete situational awareness and assessment of enemy activities for on-going US missions, and second, provide surgical cueing for MASINT-X opportunities. Automated knowledge-based tools and decision aids will provide a more effective exploitation of MASINT with its complementary multi-source sensor and intelligence data for improved Situational Awareness. The development of tools and techniques that equip the operational analyst in providing timely and highly accurate signature characterization of signals and objects leading to threat analysis is increasingly critical to MASINT domain issues.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>

<p>8. GOVERNMENT APPROVED ACCOUNTING SYSTEM: An offeror must have an government approved accounting system prior to award of a cost-reimbursement contract per limitations set forth in FAR 16.301-3(a) to ensure the system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. The acceptability of an accounting system is determined based upon an audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). IMPORTANT: If you do not have a DCAA approved accounting system access the following link for instructions: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=<br />core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: White papers and proposals will be evaluated through a peer or scientific review process using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, and will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: <br />(1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates the detailed approach, development, and testing of the proposed new technology to achieve relevant new capabilities or enhancements, <br />(2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, <br />(3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and <br />(4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. <br /><br />3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Confidential, SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. The offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a> and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp</a> or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-3572. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your Proposal.</p>
<p>3. Data Rights: The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement.

<br />The U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center, Product Manager, Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS), Natick, MA is conducting Market Research regarding industry's interest and capability in providing a replacement for the Mobile Kitchen Trailer (MKT), first fielded in 1975. This Sources Sought Request for Information is part of that market research, which may assist the Government in developing future procurement strategies. The MKT replacement system shall be called the Battlefield Kitchen (BK). Like the MKT, the BK will be a trailer based kitchen, sized to feed up to 300 personnel at remote field sites. It will be towed by the Light Medium Tactical Vehicle (LMTV) and prepare the full range of military rations. <br /><br />The BK will have the same basic capabilities as the current MKT with significant improvements in key areas. The BK will be a mobile trailer based system capable of being transported overland (road and cross country). It will also be transported by rail and air, by both helicopter sling load and fixed wing aircraft (C-130 and larger). Basic improvements expected from the BK are in the areas of kitchen work area efficiency, appliance efficiency, kitchen air quality, work area lighting, kitchen noise reduction, appliance temperature control, and kitchen environmental control. <br /><br />The MKT utilizes the Modern Burner Unit (MBU) as the heat source for its appliances. These are 'open flame' burners that operate on JP-8 and a small amount of electrical power (75 watts) required for ignition, controls, air pumps, etc. Significant improvements over the MKT appliances are required of the BK appliances. The BK appliances are being designed around two basic principles: 1) the appliances will adhere to a standardized footprint of 22 inches wide by 27 inches deep. This will allow for complete interchangeability between appliances in any given layout, and 2) the ability to collect and expel cooking and combustion effluent from the kitchen. This ability must be downloadable into alternate structures/shelters with the appliances. Once downloaded the system can be reassembled into a fully functional, ventilated kitchen. The appliances must also be download for individual stand-alone applications. The goal is to provide a safe and productive work environment regardless of the ventilation properties of the site chosen. <br /><br />The government has been developing designs of the BK modular appliances, their heat source burner, and the BK platform. The intent is for the Government to provide the technical data developed to date to the BK contractor. The Government has done much of the conceptual and developmental work on the BK and components to reduce risk and fulfill its intention to have Government purpose rights and configuration control of the BK, modular appliances, and burner. These data rights will be used for full and open competition in future follow-on contracts for BK production and support. The drawing package will not be complete at the time of this upcoming contract. The intent of the contract is to have the BK contract awardee complete the developmental work and technical data package. Subsequent production and support contracts will be fully competed using the technical data completed and obtained during this first contract. Status of current efforts is as follows: <br /><br />BK appliance burner: The appliance burner is in near production ready condition. Following performance verification this year it is expected that a complete and verified drawing package will be available at the time of the developmental contract award. <br /><br />Modular Appliances: The government is currently in possession of technical data and prototypes that function at about 80% of the desired performance. A design upgrade is in progress to reduce weight and cost, and increase performance to the project threshold levels as a minimum. The technical data along with prototype equipment, and all test data will be made available to the BK developer to complete the development to include producability. If the Contractor prefers to present their own design, government purpose rights to all technical data will be sought and taken into consideration during proposal evaluation. <br /><br />BK platform: The BK platform design is mostly conceptual at this time. The government has developed and possesses a solid model of components in various stages of development. It is anticipated that some of the design features will be proven through prototyping and demonstration in FY2015. All technical data and test data will be made available to contractors at the time of the release of the Request for Proposals (RFP). It will be the prospective Contractor's responsibility to review the government data presented and determine the suitability of the design and data for this effort. The contractor will be responsible for meeting all of the performance requirements of the BK regardless of the extent to which they use the government technical data unless adherence to the technical data in whole or part is expressly required by the government. <br /><br />BK Trailer: Use of a standard Army trailer for the BK is highly desired, and the leading candidate is the M1061. This is a 16,000 lb. capacity lunette trailer with a 38 inch deck height.(The maximum height of the BK configured for transport cannot exceed 96 inches to meet the C-130 transportability requirements.) Testing of the M1061 is scheduled this year to evaluate its suitability for the BK. Some modifications of the trailer may be necessary to meet the BK application. It is likely that the M1061 or other standard Army trailer (with minimal modifications) will be specified. <br /><br />Key BK requirements: <br /><br />C-130 and larger air transportability (maximum height 96 inches in transportation mode) Erectable by 4 persons in no greater than 30 minutes (not including site prep and leveling of platform) <br />2-4 man portable appliance modules <br />Cross country as well as highway transportability <br />LMTV compatible (maximum rated towing capacity 12,000 pounds) <br />Cooking capacity of 3 UGR-A meals of 300 servings 3 times per day <br />Food prep and cook time - maximum of 4 hours for all UGR-A menus. <br />On board refrigeration (size maximized to fit within one 22 quote mark x27 quote mark module position but no specific cavity capacity specified) <br />Modular Hand wash sink and separate food preparation sink <br />Minimum 4 well serving line with accommodations for an internal serving line <br />All components including generator transported on board kitchen platform <br />Active cooking and combustion product exhaust system that is downloadable with appliances <br />Food holding capability <br />Kitchen noise levels not to exceed 85 dBA, steady state average not to exceed 70 dBA <br />Fully functional in environmental conditions from -25 F to +120 F. <br />Ability to complex with a minimum of 1 additional BK back to back or multiple BKs daisy chained (current government concept only allows for back to back) <br />Minimum appliance heat transfer efficiencies of: <br />o 30% for oven <br />o 36% for griddle and skillets <br />Lighting meeting the requirements of MIL-STD-810 <br />Will utilize an Army standard 3 kW generator that will be transported on the BK trailer. <br />There will be a parasitic requirement of 700 watts to power the Food Sanitation Center (FSC). <br />Designed for low cost and ease of maintenance <br />Less than $150,000 manufactured cost desirable <br /><br />All interested firms and manufacturers, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information. Information submissions should include available technology, product literature and illustrations, relevant company background/experience, experience designing systems to meet performance specifications and configuration control, experience developing technical manuals, existing quality assurance program, recent unit prices of the products presented in the vendor's response to include proposed costs for 1, 10, 50 and 100 systems, NAICS Code and whether or not vendor is a small business (include number of employees). Information submissions must be received NLT 5:00 p.m. EST on August 1st 2015. Responses to this notice should be directed to: U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center, Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems, Food Service Equipment Team, ATTN: SFAE-CSS-E2 FS (Glenn Doucet), Natick MA 01760-5057, or email to glenn.a.doucet.civ@mail.mil.

<br />The U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center, Product Manager, Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS), Natick, MA is conducting Market Research regarding industry's interest and capability in providing a replacement for the Mobile Kitchen Trailer (MKT), first fielded in 1975. This Sources Sought Request for Information is part of that market research, which may assist the Government in developing future procurement strategies. The MKT replacement system shall be called the Battlefield Kitchen (BK). Like the MKT, the BK will be a trailer based kitchen, sized to feed up to 300 personnel at remote field sites. It will be towed by the Light Medium Tactical Vehicle (LMTV) and prepare the full range of military rations. <br /><br />The BK will have the same basic capabilities as the current MKT with significant improvements in key areas. The BK will be a mobile trailer based system capable of being transported overland (road and cross country). It will also be transported by rail and air, by both helicopter sling load and fixed wing aircraft (C-130 and larger). Basic improvements expected from the BK are in the areas of kitchen work area efficiency, appliance efficiency, kitchen air quality, work area lighting, kitchen noise reduction, appliance temperature control, and kitchen environmental control. <br /><br />The MKT utilizes the Modern Burner Unit (MBU) as the heat source for its appliances. These are 'open flame' burners that operate on JP-8 and a small amount of electrical power (75 watts) required for ignition, controls, air pumps, etc. Significant improvements over the MKT appliances are required of the BK appliances. The BK appliances are being designed around two basic principles: 1) the appliances will adhere to a standardized footprint of 22 inches wide by 27 inches deep. This will allow for complete interchangeability between appliances in any given layout, and 2) the ability to collect and expel cooking and combustion effluent from the kitchen. This ability must be downloadable into alternate structures/shelters with the appliances. Once downloaded the system can be reassembled into a fully functional, ventilated kitchen. The appliances must also be download for individual stand-alone applications. The goal is to provide a safe and productive work environment regardless of the ventilation properties of the site chosen. <br /><br />The government has been developing designs of the BK modular appliances, their heat source burner, and the BK platform. The intent is for the Government to provide the technical data developed to date to the BK contractor. The Government has done much of the conceptual and developmental work on the BK and components to reduce risk and fulfill its intention to have Government purpose rights and configuration control of the BK, modular appliances, and burner. These data rights will be used for full and open competition in future follow-on contracts for BK production and support. The drawing package will not be complete at the time of this upcoming contract. The intent of the contract is to have the BK contract awardee complete the developmental work and technical data package. Subsequent production and support contracts will be fully competed using the technical data completed and obtained during this first contract. Status of current efforts is as follows: <br /><br />BK appliance burner: The appliance burner is in near production ready condition. Following performance verification this year it is expected that a complete and verified drawing package will be available at the time of the developmental contract award. <br /><br />Modular Appliances: The government is currently in possession of technical data and prototypes that function at about 80% of the desired performance. A design upgrade is in progress to reduce weight and cost, and increase performance to the project threshold levels as a minimum. The technical data along with prototype equipment, and all test data will be made available to the BK developer to complete the development to include producability. If the Contractor prefers to present their own design, government purpose rights to all technical data will be sought and taken into consideration during proposal evaluation. <br /><br />BK platform: The BK platform design is mostly conceptual at this time. The government has developed and possesses a solid model of components in various stages of development. It is anticipated that some of the design features will be proven through prototyping and demonstration in FY2015. All technical data and test data will be made available to contractors at the time of the release of the Request for Proposals (RFP). It will be the prospective Contractor's responsibility to review the government data presented and determine the suitability of the design and data for this effort. The contractor will be responsible for meeting all of the performance requirements of the BK regardless of the extent to which they use the government technical data unless adherence to the technical data in whole or part is expressly required by the government. <br /><br />BK Trailer: Use of a standard Army trailer for the BK is highly desired, and the leading candidate is the M1061. This is a 16,000 lb. capacity lunette trailer with a 38 inch deck height.(The maximum height of the BK configured for transport cannot exceed 96 inches to meet the C-130 transportability requirements.) Testing of the M1061 is scheduled this year to evaluate its suitability for the BK. Some modifications of the trailer may be necessary to meet the BK application. It is likely that the M1061 or other standard Army trailer (with minimal modifications) will be specified. <br /><br />Key BK requirements: <br /><br />C-130 and larger air transportability (maximum height 96 inches in transportation mode) Erectable by 4 persons in no greater than 30 minutes (not including site prep and leveling of platform) <br />2-4 man portable appliance modules <br />Cross country as well as highway transportability <br />LMTV compatible (maximum rated towing capacity 12,000 pounds) <br />Cooking capacity of 3 UGR-A meals of 300 servings 3 times per day <br />Food prep and cook time - maximum of 4 hours for all UGR-A menus. <br />On board refrigeration (size maximized to fit within one 22 quote mark x27 quote mark module position but no specific cavity capacity specified) <br />Modular Hand wash sink and separate food preparation sink <br />Minimum 4 well serving line with accommodations for an internal serving line <br />All components including generator transported on board kitchen platform <br />Active cooking and combustion product exhaust system that is downloadable with appliances <br />Food holding capability <br />Kitchen noise levels not to exceed 85 dBA, steady state average not to exceed 70 dBA <br />Fully functional in environmental conditions from -25 F to +120 F. <br />Ability to complex with a minimum of 1 additional BK back to back or multiple BKs daisy chained (current government concept only allows for back to back) <br />Minimum appliance heat transfer efficiencies of: <br />o 30% for oven <br />o 36% for griddle and skillets <br />Lighting meeting the requirements of MIL-STD-810 <br />Will utilize an Army standard 3 kW generator that will be transported on the BK trailer. <br />There will be a parasitic requirement of 700 watts to power the Food Sanitation Center (FSC). <br />Designed for low cost and ease of maintenance <br />Less than $150,000 manufactured cost desirable <br /><br />All interested firms and manufacturers, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information. Information submissions should include available technology, product literature and illustrations, relevant company background/experience, experience designing systems to meet performance specifications and configuration control, experience developing technical manuals, existing quality assurance program, recent unit prices of the products presented in the vendor's response to include proposed costs for 1, 10, 50 and 100 systems, NAICS Code and whether or not vendor is a small business (include number of employees). Information submissions must be received NLT 5:00 p.m. EST on August 1st 2015. Responses to this notice should be directed to: U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center, Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems, Food Service Equipment Team, ATTN: SFAE-CSS-E2 FS (Glenn Doucet), Natick MA 01760-5057, or email to glenn.a.doucet.civ@mail.mil.

The Department of the Interior, The National Park Service, Intermountain Region, contemplates award of a service contract, five year base period and five one-year option years to the offeror whose proposal provides the best value to the Government for Transit Services located at Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah. Authority: P L 105-391, 16 USC  5961(a).
NAICS: 485113
DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:
The contractor shall provide all buses, personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to provide the transit service that will be defined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), and in accordance with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, Department of Transportation, Title 49, CFR Part 383, controlled substances and alcohol use and testing. Medical Advisory Criteria for Evaluation under 49 CFR Park 391.41, Department of Public Instruction Office Services, National Fire Protection Agency 10 (NFPA 10), and the State of Utah Department of Transportation. 
The system operates during the period of highest visitation, i.e. late spring  fall, with less visitation at the start and end of this season. The service is temporarily suspended during situations such as weather or emergencies, when buses cannot be safely operated.

Additionally, two round-trip tours to a farther point (Rainbow Point) may be conducted, one in the morning and one in the evening. The Contractor may add trailers to the main vehicle to increase seating for a Rainbow Point twice daily round-trip. The altitude of the route changes from 7,620 feet at the Shuttle Staging Area to 8,296 feet at Bryce Point, and to 9,200 feet at Rainbow Point. The Bryce Canyon Visitor Center is at 7,888 feet. In an emergency, buses may be required to operate up to 9,200 feet at Rainbow Point (to transport fire crews for example). 
The Contractor shall provide safe, timely, professional, and reliable services. The Contractor shall manage costs and resources effectively while meeting the terms of this contract and staying within the NPS approved annual allocation.
In addition, the Contractor shall also provide all labor, parts, tools, equipment, and supplies necessary for the operation, maintenance (routine and specialized), repair, rebuilding, replacement, upgrading, and cleaning of all transit vehicles.
There exists a current Shuttle Staging Area with available office space and parking area adequate to operate shuttle services and park all buses overnight. No maintenance may occur in this area. A separate maintenance facility operated off-site will need to be included in the proposal. 

Emissions by the buses, including but not limited to NOx and PM, are a major concern of the NPS. Buses the Contractor proposes should meet, at minimum, the EPA Tier II standards for the size vehicles proposed by the offeror and generally be consistent with the EPAs National Clean Diesel Campaign if proposing the use of diesel vehicles. 
Once the solicitation is posted, the request for proposals and documents shall be available without charge, through www.fbo.gov. Work will be completed in accordance with government furnished specifications and plans. A paper solicitation will not be issued and electronic submission of contractors proposals will only be accepted by submission to Julie_Newland@nps.gov

The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price, 100% small business set-aside contract for the procurement of Orthotic Blank and accessories for Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune. The requirement is for one base year and four option years. This office will no longer issue a hard copy of the Request for Quote (RFQ); therefore, a copy can be obtained from website http://www.neco.navy.mil. By submitting an offer, the vendor is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency.  Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the offer.
  By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this RFQ, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States.  Lack of registration in the SAM database will make a contractor ineligible for award.  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at https://www.bpn.gov.  The solicitation will contain the clause FAR 52.217-8, and the prices under this clause will be evaluated prior to award.
  The RFQ should be posted on or before 04 November 2015.

<DESC>FRTIB is in the process of refining the requirements for ExPRESS and has not made any decisions regarding a final RFP request. The intent of publishing the Draft PWS is to gather comments/best practices from industry. As such, questions and comments received in response to this draft PWS shall not be shared with industry. Vendors are encouraged to provide comments, suggestions, solutions, innovations, questions, etc based on the information that has been provided with the Draft PWS. Vendors are reminded that this is not a RFP and as such, may respond as a single entity or a joint environment. How a vendor responds to this Draft PWS will have no impact on any future submissions. Vendors are encouraged to provide comments, suggestions, solutions, innovations, questions, etc. based on the information that has been provided with the Draft PWS.
<p>The vendor response date has been extended to 2 November 2015, 3:00PM Eastern. Vendors should send submissions electronically to FRTIBContracting @tsp.gov.</p>
<p>Vendors who have been granted Explicit Access to the documents are reminded to ensure that before they share the documents with either team members or potential sub-contracts that they submit a completed NDA for each individual who will be viewing the documents. Any individual who wants direct access to the documents via FBO must submit to the FBO Explicit Access process. The authorization to view Explicit Access documents process is managed by FBO, not by FRTIB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CLARIFICATION OF QUESTIONS TO INDUSTRY:</p>
<p>Question #3: When referring to the "transition time", FRTIB is referring to the Phase-In phase into steady state outlined within the PWS.</p>
<p>Question #6: For this question, FRTIB is looking for the best approach for change management</p>
<p>Questions #11: The ExPRESS Document Repository contains a number of artifacts that provide information regarding FRTIB's current application and systems environments. These documents are located in the folder labeled, "4.8 IT Architecture &amp; Topologies" and include a detailed Functional Design Document for the current Participant Services Representative (PSR) system which will be replaced by the Participant Engagement Hub (PEH), as defined in the PWS. The folder also contains a document titled, "4.1 To-Be State Diagrams" that includes FRTIB Application Interface Tables.</p>
<p><br />Question #13: "Future phases" is referring to transition within the four phases that are in scope for ExPRESS. More specifically, adding functionality as you move from Steady State to Optimization and Optimization to Transformation.</p>
<p>Question #14: FRTIB is looking for service level requirements for all forms processing to include OCR capture as well as other processes.</p>
<p>PWS: Under Section 3.1.3 Security Requirements, #16 prohibits any electronic devices. This refers to vendor employees utilizing personal electronic devices within the service center during business hours. It does not restrict vendor responsibilities regarding the transformation of the participant experience with social media and other mobile device campaigns.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity and Communications <br />Stakeholder Engagement and Cyber Infrastructure Resilience (DHS/CS&amp;C/SECIR) has a requirement increase the contract ceiling amount on a sole source basis to reserve and fund an exhibitor booth at the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco, taking place February 29, 2016 - March 4, 2016 and February 27, 2017 - March 3, 2017. Approval is sought to increase the contract ceiling amount on a sole source contract that was awarded to Nth Degree for the RSA Security Conference on December 17, 2014.
<p>Through its participation, DHS will continue to foster existing partnerships with Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial governments, and international partners in attendance to educate and build awareness for safe cyber and communication practices, programs, and resources. These new and existing partnerships are vital to our mission enabling the groundwork for increased information sharing among our trusted stakeholders with an interest in preventing, mitigating, and managing incidents that could impact the Nation's critical infrastructure sectors. The RSA Security Conference directly supports DHS' goal to promote cybersecurity knowledge and innovation, therefore, DHS, through the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications (CS&amp;C) funds and sponsors an exhibition booth at the RSA Security Conference.</p>
