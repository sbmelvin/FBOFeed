<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY – The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE basis with the Ambulatory Pediatric Association, 6728 Old McLean Village Drive, McLean, Va  22101.  The Public Health Service Act, Title XII, authorizes HRSA to train primary care providers to care for underserved populations, especially those located in medically underserved communities, and to train interns who are representative of disadvantaged backgrounds.  The Ambulatory Pediatric Association (APA) developed and published in 1992 APA Educational Guidelines for Ambulatory/General Pediatrics Fellowship Training.  Systemic changes have taken place within the body of medical knowledge and the system of health care delivery that have necessitated the updating of these guidelines.  Because HRSA’s mission includes the training of primary care providers, it requires updated educational guidelines for ambulatory/general pediatric fellowships and assistance in encouraging their use by the various fellowship programs.

This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions.  The period of performance for this project is one year.   In accordance with FAR 13.106-1, a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file.   The Ambulatory Pediatrics Association is the owner of the APA Educational Guidelines for Ambulatory /General Pediatrics Fellowship Training. They are the only known entity that can address the issues in this procurement on behalf of all of the Ambulatory Pediatrics training programs.  Procurement requires the use of these guidelines in order to update and enhance them. APA are the proprietors of the Guidelines which are not available from any other source. 

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY – The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE basis with The Home Safety Council, 1725 Eye Street NW, Washington, DC 20006.  The purpose of this procurement is two-fold: 1) expand HRSA’s Poison Control Program stakeholders to include more national injury prevention and health organizations, medical and health associations, and state and local government agencies, and 2) implement and facilitate an educational forum with the stakeholders for the purpose of developing and tracking recommendations on how to address the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) recommendations encouraging collaboration and integration of public education efforts into the public health system.  As a result of the educational forum, a report shall be prepared which will summarize the issues and recommendations of the forum. This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions.  The period of performance for this project is 12 months.   In accordance with FAR 13.106-1, a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file.  The Home Safety Council is the only national non-profit organization solely dedicated to preventing home related injuries that result in thousands of deaths and injuries each year.  This will be an opportunity for HRSA to develop a partnership with an organization that is dedicated solely to reaching poisonings’ largest targeted population.  In addition, staff at the Home Safety Council served as an expert member on the IOM Committee on Poison Prevention and Control that produced the IOM Report “Forging a Poison Prevention and Control System.”

Also provide the firms resume with names and phone numbers for contacts (best value/ past performance and experience) Exotic vegetation control on San Diego National Wildlife Refuge Purpose: The purpose of this agreement is to provide control of isolated infestations of exotic vegetation, including saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissima) and fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) in several locations on San Diego National Wildlife Refuge (SDNWR). Agency Contacts: United States Fish and Wildlife Service, San Diego National Wildlife Refuge: John Martin: Refuge Wildlife Biologist (619) 669-7295, cell (619) 247-5277, fax (619) 669-7292 Don Brubaker: Refuge Operations Specialist (619) 669-7295, cell (619) 843-3647, fax (619) 669-7292 Val Urban: Refuge Manager (619) 669-7295, fax (619) 669-7292 Slader Buck: Acting Project Leader: (760) 930-0168,cell (619) 719-8599, fax (760) 930-0256 Contractor: To be determined. Program Responsibility: The contractor shall assist refuge staff by conducting exotic vegetation control measures on SDNWR.  The Refuge Biologist has identified 7-10 minor infestations of saltcedar and a comparable number of similar infestations of fennel.  Because these infestations are relatively isolated occurrences surrounded by upland areas, re-infestation is less likely than if the sites were Adownstream@ (literally and figuratively) from sources of seed sources of these species.  Work will commence after August 1 2005 and may be conducted at any time during the following year. Work will consist of 1) cutting of all saltcedar trees to within 15 cm of the ground, using a chain saw or other device which will cut the tree off quickly, 2) application of Pathfinder II J herbicide or 25% Garlon 4 (which is 62% triclopyr), diluted in generic food grade vegetable oil at a 1:3 ratio, to the cut stumps within two minutes of cutting, 3) application of 5% solution of glyphosate-based herbicide (e.g., Roundup), to growing fennel prior to anthesis; 4) re-treatment of fennel approximately 3-4 weeks after the initial application, as necessary to kill plants that were not killed by the first application; 5) coordination as needed with SDNWR staff; and, 5) provision of technical advice to SDNWR staff as appropriate.  If treated saltcedar stumps re-sprout following winter 2005-2006 rains, sprouts will be cut and re-treated.  Items 1 and 2 are to be conducted in accordance with the Pesticide Use Permit (PUP) applicable to this project.  Cut saltcedar will be left on the site, where it will provide cover for wildlife until it decays.  To minimize potential for deleterious effects to wildlife due to vehicles, the contractor shall park as directed by the Refuge Biologist, and carry all equipment and materials to the site on foot. The FWS is responsible for law enforcement within SDNWR.  Supervision of activities of all parties relating to management of federally endangered species, including coastal California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica californica) and Quino checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha quino) is the responsibility of the Refuge Manager of SDNWR. FWS staff are responsible for assuring that contractors have legal access to the proposed treatment areas.  FWS will provide the contractor with Arcview shapefiles and/or hard-copy maps indicating the location of the saltcedar and/or fennel infestations.   Authority: These National Wildlife Refuges are established in part, A...for the protection and preservation of endangered and threatened species and their habitat@. (50 CFR 25.11) Contractual Time Frame: August 1, 2005 through August 1, 2007 Scheduling: The contractor shall coordinate scheduling of treatment of exotic vegetation with the Refuge Manager or his designated representative. Equipment: Contractor is responsible for providing all necessary equipment for operation of the program including chain saws, fuel, spray application equipment, herbicides, personal protective equipment, and vehicles. Reporting and Payment: The Refuge Manager or his designated representative shall issue a task order for treatment of a specific infestation of saltcedar or fennel.  The contractor shall submit an invoice for treatment of that infestation, and upon completion of the work specified in that task order, receive payment.  Subsequent task orders shall be issued until the amount of money paid on this contract reaches $25,000.00, or until further effective vegetation control cannot be accomplished without exhausting the $25,000.00 available for this project. Completion of project.  The contractor shall report completion of saltcedar or fennel treatment prescribed on a task order to (Refuge Biologist) John Martin within 48 hours of completion.  Inspection. The Refuge Manager or his designated representative will visit the work site within one week of completion of control activities, to ensure that the work is complete.  Refuge staff will conduct an additional inspection in March 2006, to determine whether re-treatment of stump sprouts of saltcedar is necessary.  The Service may withhold a maximum of 20% of the total amount of the agreement until re-treatment of stump sprouts is complete or is determined to be unnecessary. Budget: 2005-2006 Exotic vegetation control on San Diego National Wildlife Refuge The total budget for this project shall not exceed $25,000.00.

<SUBJECT>A -- Switchblade Oblique Flying Wing (OFW) Program Phase I
<SOLNBR>BAA05-40
<RESPDATE>100305
<ARCHDATE>10182005
<CONTACT>Patty Matyskiela, Contract Specialist, Phone 571-218-4686, Fax 703-696-2208, Email pmatyskiela@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Tactical Technology Office (TTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative proposals for Phase I of the Switchblade program.  The Switchblade program is pursuing development and demonstration of critical enabling technologies for an operational oblique flying wing (OFW) aircraft.  In addition to this BAA, and before submitting proposals, prospective Offerors must refer to the Switchblade Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) located at the DARPA website, http://www.darpa.mil/baa for further information.  The Switchblade PIP contains additional details regarding the Program Description, Phase I Statement of Objectives, Proposal Guidance, and Evaluation Criteria for Award.
OVERALL PROGRAM GOAL AND VISION:  The goals of the Switchblade program are to mature critical enabling technologies for an OFW, validate design methodologies and conduct an experimental airplane (X-Plane) flight demonstration to prove the feasibility of a supersonic, tailless, oblique flying wing aircraft. Some of the key technology challenges will be in the areas of aerodynamics, controls, propulsion integration, and aeroelasticity.  For affordability reasons, the X-Plane should be designed to focus on the key technologies for the offeror’s operational concept that require flight demonstration.  It is not envisioned that all critical technologies will require flight demonstration.  Ground testing, modeling and simulation, and parallel, off-program risk reduction or technology maturation efforts should be leveraged to mature as many of the technology challenges associated with the operational OFW concept as possible. 
PHASE I DESCRIPTION: DARPA may fund one or more contractor teams for Phase I, Risk Reduction, Testing and Preliminary Design. During Phase I, the performer(s) will refine and execute their proposed Technology Maturation Plan for reducing the risk of the critical technologies associated with their operational OFW conceptual design. The performer(s) will also develop a derivative X-Plane preliminary design and conduct detailed planning for Phase II.  The performer(s) will update their operational aircraft and X-Plane designs as appropriate, based on emerging Phase I risk reduction results. The performer(s) should develop a demonstration philosophy that will result in an affordable Phase II demonstration program that maximizes risk reduction through X-Plane flight testing, as well as complementary ground demonstrations.  Offerors are directed to the PIP for further information.
FUNDING:  Due to the challenging suite of technologies that must be matured to support the OFW vision, as well as the expected variability in Offeror approaches, DARPA has not established a funding objective or schedule for Phase I. The Offeror is expected to provide a realistic technical and cost proposal for best achieving the program objectives within their proposed schedule.  The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and fund portions of proposals if warranted.  Proposal preparation costs shall not be allowable as a direct charge to any resulting contract or agreement. Final funding determination will be based on the combination of proposed approaches which will reasonably support program success.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation because of the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research and development in OFW technology.
AWARD INSTRUMENT AND EVALUATION APPROACH: In addition to a conventional procurement contract, the Offeror has the opportunity to propose an Other Transactions (OT) for Prototypes Agreement.  The Government may elect to award either a procurement contract or an OT Agreement.  Offerors are asked to submit two proposal responses:  one for a procurement contract that does not include cost share, and the second for an OT agreement, that may include cost share.   The Government will evaluate all Offerors’ no-cost-share proposals  in accordance with the established evaluation criteria (see Section 4 of the PIP, Evaluation Criteria for Award), other applicable published procedures (FAR Part 35) and the source selection plan. Interim negotiations may be conducted during this evaluation process.  After award selection based on the no-cost-share proposals, the Government will evaluate the selected awardees’ OT proposals with the intent of selecting a Phase I procurement instrument that offers the more beneficial program approach to the Government.  Historically, DARPA has solicited the use of OTs exclusively for programs such as this where performance is conducted over multiple phases and it is likely that revolutionary technology accomplishment will benefit both government and industry.  An OT agreement may offer significant advantages for the Performer and/or the Government if the conditions for an OT can be met by the Offeror. OTs are discussed in more detail in Section 3 of the PIP.  The intent of this evaluation approach is to prevent contractors with greater financial flexibility from reducing the proposed cost to the Government by providing a large cost share or extra effort beyond that of a contractor with less financial capability.  In this approach all proposals are evaluated based upon their technical merits and ability to realistically price their proposed technical scope.  This approach also affords the Offerors and the Government the opportunity to assess, propose and implement the most beneficial approach to program accomplishment.  This approach may also be used in later phases.
PROPOSAL PROCEDURES:  The Offeror's proposal shall consist of three volumes: Volume 1, No-Cost-Share Technical Proposal; Volume 2, No-Cost-Share Based Cost Proposal; and Volume 3, OTA Based Delta Proposal.  Volume 3 should represent any difference in technical work and associated cost proposed based on a no-cost-share contract versus the technical work and cost proposed based on an OT agreement.  If there are no differences, the Offeror should state this in Volume 3 of its proposal.  Volume 3 should also discuss how an OTA would potentially be a better contracting mechanism for both Industry and Government to utilize in Phase I of the Switchblade program.  The Offeror should refer to Section 3 of the PIP for guidance on how to structure and organize its proposal.  All Offerors must be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and must provide their CAGE, DUNS and TIN numbers on the cover sheet of the proposal.  Twelve printed copies of each volume are required for submission.  The Offeror is also required to submit their proposal in electronic format, on CD-ROM, in Microsoft Office 2000 compatible format.  Four CD-ROMs with a copy of Volumes 1 and 2 (only) are required.  For Volume 3, four electronic copies are also required; this CD-ROM should contain only Volume 3. The deadline for receipt of proposals is October 3, 2005, 4:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time.  All proposals should be mailed or hand-carried to the delivery address as follows:  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; Attention:  Mr. Mark Bennington, CMO; Switchblade BAA 05-40; 3701 N. Fairfax Drive; Arlington, VA 22203-1714.  Each volume of the proposal shall be packed and sealed separately and clearly marked to identify the volume number.  Responses not received at the address and time specified above will not be considered.  An Offeror intending to include classified information or data as part of its proposal submission should refer to Section 3 of the PIP for instructions.  
ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest.  All Offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the Offeror supports and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposed submission, and the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the Offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.  If the Offeror believes that no such conflict exists, then the Offeror shall so state in the affirmation.
NON-GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL: The Government intends to use support contractors, plus other independent experts to assist in processing and administering proposals during the Source Selection, and to provide advice relative to selected technical areas.  These personnel are restricted by their contract from disclosing information contained in any proposal for any purpose to anyone outside of the Source Selection for this effort.  Moreover, all personnel used in this capacity are required to enter into separate Organizational Conflict of Interest/Non Disclosure Agreements to this effect.  By submission of its proposal, a team agrees that proposals may be disclosed to these personnel for the purpose of providing this assistance.
PECEDENCE OF THE BAA:  In the event of discrepancies between the BAA and the PIP in the stated requirements, proposal submission instructions, or other items, the instruction in the BAA shall take precedence.

<DESC>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) has delegated authority to conduct personnel security background investigations on prospective ATF applicants, contractors, and other non-ATF personnel, as well as conducting periodic reinvestigations on all current employees.   The purpose of these investigations is to determine suitability for employment and/or eligibility to access National Security Information.  Background investigations are conducted in accordance with established Executive Orders 10450 and 12968, the Privacy Act of 1974, Office of Personnel Management regulations and these regulations are applied during administration of the personnel security program.  Background investigations are also conducted in accordance with other relevant regulations and Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF policies and procedures that will be made known to the Contractor.  

ATF has established a contract background investigation program to contract these investigations out to trained and experienced investigators.  Operational and administration aspects of the program are also contracted out to trained and experienced investigators or personnel security professionals, typically, though not exclusively, retired federal investigators who have at least 3 years of current experience in the administration of and/or conduct of personnel security background investigations.  Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them by ATF.

Contractors must be computer literate and efficient in software programs that support email, word processing, and data entry, which are utilized in the administration of the personnel security program.

Contractors’ duties and work hours are dictated by the ATF workload and funding availability.  Contractors are expected to be available to accept work as requested.  Contractors will be paid at the rate of $53.00 per hour.   The hourly rate will be reviewed on an annual basis and may be adjusted as determined by the increase of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Internal reviews of Contractor performance are conducted on a quarterly basis.  

In compliance with ATF’s specific invoicing procedures, Contractors must submit an invoice for payment detailing the number of hours worked.  Such invoice will be subject to audit by ATF. Contractors must also execute a Contractor Certification that declares that any submission of a Contractor’s invoice represents actual hours performed in accordance with requirements of the Statement of Work. 

ATF may use the services of a third party contractor to provide administrative records and financial management services.  This includes processing invoices and making payments for ATF designated contracts such as those for conducting background investigations.  Consequently contractors are advised that the third party, rather than ATF, may provide actual payment for services rendered and accepted by ATF under any resulting contract.   


Contractors must be willing to attend periodic conferences at selected locations within the United States.  Conferences are usually limited to one per year.  

Contractors will have access to ATF’s computer network and will sign ATF P 7500.1, ATF Rules of Behavior and Customer Agreement for ATF Workstation Users.  Contractors are required to successfully complete ATF Information System Security Awareness training each year.

Contractors shall submit to the performance of a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).  Favorable adjudication of the SSBI must be determined by ATF prior to access to ATF facilities and information.  ATF will conduct an SSBI-Periodic Reinvestigation on contract investigators every five years.

Contractors must execute, and abide by the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement.  

Contractors must be a certified contractor in the Central Contractor Register (CCR), for payment via electronic funds transfer.  

ATF intends to issue to multiple vendors Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) that will be available for placing calls/orders through September 30, 2010.  There is an initial solicitation with a closing date of August 26th, 2005.  All responses will be evaluated and a sufficient number of awards will be made to the most advantageous (most highly rated) companies.     ATF’s objective is to provide a sufficient number of sources, geographically distributed, to ensure prompt and efficient performance of background investigations.  Because ATF’s needs are dynamic, ATF anticipates a requirement to periodically add new contractors to the pool.  Therefore, ATF will retain offers received after the initial closing date and continually accept new responses for future consideration.  ATF will acknowledge receipt of offers and evaluate them for award when the need arises.

Vendors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a BPA.  A BPA is not a contract.  A BPA is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected vendors are in a position to furnish and eliminates the need for more complex acquisition methods.  There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity.  All calls/orders must be acknowledged and accepted by the selected vendor, or the call will be transferred to another vendor.  Calls/orders may be competed among all vendors at the same time, upon the discretion of the ATF representative.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561611 Investigation Services, and is the appropriate designation required by the CCR.

The following clauses and provisions are incorporated and are to remain in full force:  FAR Part 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror – Commercial Items (Oct. 00) is incorporated by reference, applies to this acquisition.  Clause 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 99) Evaluation.  Each Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial.   A copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 can be found on the web at http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/oa/oa52-212-3.doc or you may submit a request to siadministration@atf.gov.

EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.

Capability of the Vendor.

ATF will consider BPAs to vendors, as needed, on a pass/fail basis, based on past performance and experience, and the vendor’s acceptability (the acceptance of ATF terms and conditions including the hourly rate).  All vendors must submit complete responses, must be able to obtain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation and must be willing and able to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with the Central Contractor Registration.  These are mandatory requirements and any firm will be eliminated that fails to comply.  Vendors will be initially screened on a pass/fail basis for acceptability.  Vendors rated as “passed” will be awarded points for past performance and experience.  Vendors with an overall score of at least 54 points and that meet the mandatory requirements will be considered for issuance of a BPA and award will be made to those companies receiving the highest scores.  At least 30 points must come from Offeror Demonstrated Experience/Capabilities and 24 must come Vendor Qualifications.

a.  Experience/Capabilities (45 Points):  Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing.  A minimum of three years combined experience as either a personnel security specialist or an investigator conducting personnel security background investigations is recommended.  ATF will evaluate each vendor’s experience on the basis of its breadth, depth, and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA. Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting and/or administering personnel security background investigations in the federal environment, as well as computer proficiency.  ATF may assess the vendor’s communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. (30 points minimum).

b.  Qualifications/Past Performance (40 Points):  Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a vendor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.  ATF may contact some of the vendor’s customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the vendor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the vendor’s performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the vendor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the vendor was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, ATF may contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases. (24 points minimum).

Contractors with recent ATF experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided to ATF.  ATF will consider performance that contractors have previously rendered to ATF to be more influential than past performance rendered to another source.

c.  Acceptability.  ATF will determine the acceptability of each vendor offer on a “pass” or “fail” basis.  A vendor’s offer is acceptable when it manifests the vendor’s assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the solicitation, including attachments and amendments (if any).  If a vendor takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the scope of work, ATF will consider its offer to be unacceptable.  Vendors wishing to take exception to the terms and conditions stated are strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer before doing so.

If a copy of the Statement of Work is required in order to respond to this solicitation, please submit a written request via email to siadministration@atf.gov.  Anyone wishing to respond to this solicitation should submit a current resume with his/her social security number, as well as all the requested information within the content of this solicitation.  This solicitation will be open throughout the period of this BPA.  All proposals received after August 26th, 2005, will be evaluated on a continual basis as needs dictate.  All responsible sources may submit an offer of interest throughout this time period.  Only written requests received directly from the requestor are acceptable.  (No phone calls will be accepted).  

Proposals are to be submitted via mail at 650 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Room 2474, Washington, DC 20226, or via email to siadministration@atf.gov and must contain all of the required information.  Point of Contact:  Chief, Personnel Security Branch.

(2) 3-User Package: Annual Support and Maintenance for Windows i86Win32VS2003, part number 33060-03-100-171, qty 1.  (3) NDDS 3.0  Target Platform Permanent, LynxOS 4.0 gcc2.95.3 / i86Lynx4.0.0gcc2.95.3, part number 33002-02-440-506, qty 1.

The requirement is sole source because the NDDS product is used with an open architecture (OA) “track manager” component of a prototype combat system.  The required software is to be used for the continued development of the prototype system.  Use of another software product would require software re-design (with cost of new software, software testing, and software designer/analyst training) that would exceed the price of the required software and result in schedule slippage.  The Government will consider offers, from all responsible sources, which evidence ability to provide software, data, software training, and software maintenance with the same or equal features, benefits, quality, and reliability of the proprietary commercial off-the-shelf products and commercial services identified above.  Offers that do not provide such evidence will not be considered.  Offers must be submitted via email to XDS13@nswc.navy.mil by 26 August 2005, 2:00 pm EST.         Award will be subject to Simplified Acquisition Procedures, in accordance with FAR 13, and procedures for acquisition of commercial items, in accordance with FAR Part 12.  Successful offeror will complete and submit representations and certifications at FAR 52.222-22 and 52.222-25 and shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database.

<DESC>This is published as a Sole Source announcement in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  See Note 22.  The NAICS code for this action is 422120. The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) San Diego, CA intends to award a sole source modification to contract N00244-00-D-0001 with Corporate Express.  The modification will extend the contract by adding two months to the period of performance.  Performance under the extension period will commence 01 October 2005.  The contract provides an electronic order entry catalog of commercial items for sale to the Government.  The contractor is responsible for providing commodity groups to include, but not limited to office supplies, tools hardware, restaurant supplies janitorial supplies and protective clothing.  The contractor has Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) capabilities for ordering and invoicing.  All items are delivered next day, pier-side/desktop directly to end user.  End users located at various Navy and other military faci! lities West of the Mississippi place orders (via DoD Emall, telephone, written, and fax) against the contract.  Extension of the current contract's performance period is necessary as a result of a shift in the acquisition strategy and subsequent award of a follow-on contract.  The proposed modification will ensure continued and/or uninterrupted contract coverage that is important to the successful accomplishment of the Navy's mission.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and a solicitation will not be issued. Interested parties may submit a statement of interest only.  The statement of interest should address how the contractor proposes to establish a presence on DoD Emall prior to the period of contract extension.  Submit statements of interest by e-mail to the contract specialist at maria.papet@navy.mil by September 1, 2005.

The x-ray equipment consists of:ADC Solo, Compact, PRID 1, PRID 2, ADC C processing server (2 each), Monitor (2 each), 4mm Tape (2 each), Drystar 3000 (2 each), and Paxport.  This contract extension modification is for the ! period 01 October 2005 through 30 September, 2006, and adds an option for an additional year, from 01 October 2006 through 30 September 2007.  AGFA Corporation is currently the only provider capable of providing the maintenance and repair service because of the proprietary nature of the equipment and software.  Therefore, because of the aforementioned factors, AGFA Corporation is the only contractor capable of providing the required services. The NAICS code for this action is 811219.

<CONTACT>Marc G. MacKeigan Contracting Officer 2022083923     marc_g_mackeigan@nbc.gov;
<DESC>This pre-solicitation notice ("Synopsis") is issued as required at FAR PART 5. The United States Department of the Interior, Office of the Secretary, National Business Center, Acquisitions & Property Management Division, on behalf of the Office of the Chief Information Officer, is pleased to inform interested parties of the forthcoming Solicitation for the products and services described below. THIS IS NOT THE SOLICITATION. The Solicitation, when available, will be posted to this site along with all attachments, instructions and forms. Detailed requirements will be provided along with instructions for submitting proposals. NO HARD COPIES OF THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE: all Solicitation documents will be available through the FedBizOps website for downloading and printing. PLEASE NOTE: In order to receive a Government contract, a company or entity must be registered with Central Contractor Registration ("CCR") and have a DUNS number. Parties who believe that they might be interested in submitting a proposal in response to the Solicitation, but do not have a DUNS number or are not registered with CCR should do so as soon as possible. A DUNS number can be obtained from Dun & Bradstreet. Go to: http://www.dnb.com/US/duns_update/  to register. The DUNS number is required before you can register with CCR. To register with CCR, go to www.ccr.gov. The Department of the Interior ("DOI") anticipates that the Solicitation will be issued on or about September 26, 2005, although DOI reserves the right to post the Solicitation sooner or later than  September 26, 2005, so long as the Solicitation posting date complies with all FAR requirements. The Contracting Officer referenced has no additional information at this time other than what appears in this Notice. Please do not call for additional information or to ask questions. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted. E-mail inquiries will not be honored. After the Solicitation has been posted, you will be able to ask questions. The DOI anticipates that this Solicitation will occur, but makes no representations or warranties that a Solicitation will ever materialize.  The Government anticipates that the Procurement will be conducted under the provisions of FAR Parts 12 ("Acquisition of Commercial Items"), and other FAR parts as applicable. Description:  The Department of the Interior (DOI) Land and Resource Management (DLRM) solution is a major cross-cutting DOI-wide initiative that will support all of the Department's land and natural resources use and management business activities. The system will be an enterprise Department-level system, developed to serve the needs of the entire land use community. The primary goal will be to maximize the use of available resources and minimize department-wide land and natural resource use management systems interoperability and standardization issues. The project will acquire Commercial off the Shelf (COTS)-based land and resource use management system(s) that will economically provide a common set of core functionalities that can be employed in supporting the spectrum of land use business processes across DOI bureaus utilizing a collaborative process. DLRM is a major cross-cutting DOI-wide enterprise initiative. The major business processes supporting land and natural resource management within DOI are: "	Ownership Management (managing ownership information to specific parcels of land) "	Inventory Management (inventory of land holdings) "	Use Authorization Management (managing permits, leases and contracts) "	Planning (planning activities to maintain and conserve the natural resource) "	Compliance (compliance with terms and conditions associated with approved use authorization activities) "	Monitoring (availability and accessibility of natural resources)  "	Custodial Management (maintenance of the land and natural resources) The DLRM investment will provide a phased approach towards providing automated solutions for land and resource management. Phase I of the project will encompass the revenue-generating activities of land holdings through Use Authorization Management (permits, leases, and contracts) as listed above. The DLRM will provide the foundation upon which a complete Land and Resource Management system will be built, which will standardize data and processes across bureaus and lines of business. The system will eventually encompass the entire spectrum of land management activities. Phase I of the DLRM will provide a state-of-the art solution for managing the use authorization component. Phase I will be comprised of two instances, the first for Indian Trust lands and associated natural resources and the second for all non-Trust business activities. The Trust instance of DLRM will offer the long-term solution to the aged legacy applications and as a risk mitigation strategy to assure functionality prior to the purchase of both instances. DOI recognizes that the business processes and rules, information requirements, and supporting data, for each of the above major land and natural resource management phases have significant similarities that are applicable to both Indian and Federal land and natural resource management. That is, there is significant opportunities for process and data standardization with accompanying component re-use. As a result, subsequent phases of the DLRM will provide an automated IT solution for the use authorization component for both Federal and Indian Trust lands that re-uses core business processes, data and capabilities from Phase I of the DLRM.  This system will provide complete, accurate and timely information concerning activities in the 600+ million acres managed by DOI. DLRM will support land management processes to best manage and maintain thorough standardized core business processes while enabling line of business details to be captured. This will give DOI an authoritative source of information, within a singular data repository, to provide managers the necessary information to enhance the decision-making process for land and natural resource management. The DLRM will provide other advantages by decreasing operational costs, supporting the modernization initiative based on reusing and minimizing development activities, and providing management with the tools to effectively direct land management activities. This system directly aligns with DOI's goals and strategies and has independently been identified in the Fiduciary Trust Model and the Trust Modernization Blueprint. DLRM was initially conceived to aid Trust land management components, but due to proven functionality duplication/commonality for other DOI bureaus, DLRM will provide an enterprise solution for DOI-wide land and resource management. While the initial implementation will support Trust requirements, acquisition will be targeted toward selecting a COTS product that will provide most of the land use management functionality identified in the common requirements. Minor differences in requirements among bureaus, as a result of regulations and established business processes, will be customized into the core product suite with supplemental bureau-specific applications. DLRM will be the cornerstone in a suite of products to be employed to accomplish the similar needs of the various bureaus. The capabilities will be determined and evaluated during the procurement process with regard to other Land and Resource Management functional areas the individual system could address, resulting in future cost savings.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR subpart 13.106-1(b), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) seeks to award a contract on a Sole Source basis to mSPEC Inc. to provide a Refurbished Mobile Tandem Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer System for EPA?s Emergency Response Team (ERT).  ERT will use the refurbished Mobile Tandem Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer for rapid response to terrorist events at different locations throughout the nation to access the site, and to advise the appropriate members of ERT.  This technology is required to be stationed at strategic locations in the United States in mobile laboratories already purchased to house and transport the instrumentation. 	Over the past 17 years, the ERT has successfully used the first and second generation instrumentation of the Mobile Tandem Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer.  The instrumentation has been used for measuring on-site and off-site migration of volatile organic compounds during pilot-scale and full-scale site operations.  This equipment has also been used to determine emission rates of volatile organic compounds.                Additionally, the first and second generation mobile tandem quadrupole mass spectrometers have successfully demonstrated their capabilities to monitor, at extremely low levels, chemical warfare agents, explosives, and drugs prepared in illegal, clandestine laboratories.  These latter capabilities have become increasingly more of a part of the U.S. EPA?s mission in protecting human health and the environment.               ERT has already purchased three (3) of these units: two (2) in 1998 and one (1) in 2003.  The refurbished unit will be the same as the existing units previously purchased by the Government and will use the identical software necessary to be compatible with the existing equipment.  Because this TAGA is no longer made by the original manufacturer, only the refurbished model will meet the needs of the Government.             The specifications of the refurbished Mobile Tandem Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer System are as follows: MDS-SCIEX/Applied Biosystems API 365 Triple Quadruple Mass Spectrometer.  Description: Mass Range 30 - 300m/z; D16B Mechanical Roughing Pump and; D10E Mechanical Roughing Pump.  Computer System: PowerMac 7300/180 and Viewsonic P7875.  Optional Computer System: Analyst 1.4 upgrade hardware & software and Dell Computer System.              Other Options: APCI; heated nebulizer; LPCI source with power supply; Harvard 552222 Pump 22 with RS232 interface; MKS Type 146 Measurement and control system; MKS Model 1479 Mass Flow controller 100sccm N2; MKS Model 1179 Mass Flow Controller 100sccm N2; MKS Ty558 Mass Flow Meter 100 sim N2; MKS Model 640 Pressure Controller VO = 10,000 sccm; cable to connect 1479 to 146; Ametek SAF Blower Motor and; four (4) ADC inputs for external signal monitoring.  	This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting documentation to the office identified above which establishes that their specifications meet the EPA?s requirement.  Documentation must be received within seven (7) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by the EPA.                A determination by EPA not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Attached Statement of Work:  SCOPE OF SERVICES EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM Denver Administrative Program Center Denver Service Center Denver Based WASO Offices I.	INTRODUCTION The Department of Interior, National Park Service, Denver Service Center (DSC) and the Washington Support Offices (WASO) provide each of its employees with Employee Assistance Program (EAP) services. These employees span the full range of socioeconomic categories and are frequently culturally diverse. While the majority of these employees are physically located in Denver, Colorado, with a satellite office in Fort Collins, Colorado, there is the potential of providing service to operating offices geographically based elsewhere. These offices provide contract EAP services under the policy direction of the Agency's Director of Administrative Program Center (APC).  The Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act of 1970 (P.L. 91-616) and the Drug Abuse Treatment Act of 1972 (P.L. 92-255) authorized federal agencies to provide appropriate alcohol and drug services for civilian employees. P.L. 79-658 also authorized heads of Agencies to establish health services programs to promote and maintain the physical and mental fitness of employees. In 1986, the Omnibus Drug Enforcement, Education and Control Act (P.L. 99-570) were enacted. That law reiterated Congressional concern about the prevention of illegal drug use and the treatment of federal employees who use drugs. Also, in 1986, Executive Order 12564 established further requirements for agencies and employees in order to obtain a drug free federal workplace. P.L. 100-71 (1987) was enacted to establish requirements for implementation of the Executive Order. The employee assistance program (EAP) was given a major role in each of these. In 1988, Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which reinforces the idea of a drug free workplace and the need for EAPs. In 1971, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) created an agency-wide program to address the interests of individuals who needed alcohol counseling. In 1972, this program was expanded to address other drug abuse. Through the mid-1970's the program was expanded to include counseling for other types of personal problems as well. II.	PURPOSE NPS views the EAP as an effective method for handling employees whose alcohol, drug, and other personal problems are affecting their ability to function on the job. The Agency is also committed to the EAP as an adjunct to a drug free workplace. The broader objectives of the program delivered under this contract are to reduce the costs associated with troubled employees (such as absenteeism, accidents, sick leave, lowered productivity) and to contribute to the creation of a drug free workplace. III.	PROJECT DESCRIPTION The EAP is available to all NPS employees, regardless of the nature of their personal problems. Up to three (3) counseling sessions per problem and a normal maximum of two (2) problems per employee per calendar year may be provided by the contractor. The program is also available to family members (either a relative of an employee or someone in a primary relationship with an employee) in two situations. 1)	The counselor may see the family member whether or not the employee is seen by the EAP when the family member has a problem that is connected with the employee's alcohol or drug abuse. In such circumstances, the family member may be the client of the program and receive all of its services. 2)	The EAP may see the family member in situations where the employee has a personal problem that may be helped by seeing the family member or when the personal problem of the family member is affecting the employee's ability to function on the job. In these situations, the program's client is the employee, not the family member, and the EAP's services are provided to the employee. In addition, the family member may be seen only if the employee him/herself is seen by the EAP, or if the intent of the EAP is to see the employee. In some situations, the EAP may assess and refer the family or couple for treatment as a unit. It is not the intention of this contract to provide EAP services convenient to the locations of family members but rather to make the services available at the sites offered to employees. Also, when family members are being seen, the counseling sessions allowable are inclusive of what employees are allowed. i.e., three (3) counseling sessions per problem and a normal maximum of two (2) problems per employee per calendar year. Confidentiality. This is a primary concern of the EAP. EAP counseling records and information from employee visits shall be kept in a confidential manner, in accordance with privacy act laws, regulations, and OPM policy. The Contractor shall be expected to conform to these standards in running the program. Exceptions to confidentiality exist for situations where an individual intends to do imminent harm to self or others, in cases when child/elder abuse or neglect is revealed, and in cases where a judge signs a court order relative to the investigation of a serious crime and demonstrates the need for client-identifying information. Cost. There are no charges to employees for the services of the EAP. If an employee accepts any referral to an outside community resource, the employee is responsible for the cost of that treatment or assistance. The Contractor shall work with the employee to try to keep the cost within the employee's financial means. Contractors shall not refer EAP clients to themselves for treatment unless no other referral sources are possible. The Contractor shall track all such referrals. Drug free workplace initiative. Executive Order 12564 and its' implementing legislation recognize that illegal drug use is seriously impairing a portion of the Federal Government's work force. In response to this, OPM developed the Drug Free Workplace Program to set forth the objectives, policies, procedures, and implementation guidelines necessary to achieve a workplace free of drugs. The Contractor shall he expected to coordinate with individuals responsible for implementing various aspects of this program on an as needed basis. Program location(s). The Contractor shall provide suitable office space for employees and counselors to meet. Contractor office site must be located within a 20 mile radius of 12795 W. Alameda Parkway, Lakewood, CO  80228.  They must also allow for confidentiality of counseling sessions and secure maintenance of records, and be pleasant and accessible to wheelchair-bound employees.  Contractor will provide similar services of the same quality for the Colorado Front Range area. Labor-management relations.  An important aspect of the EAP is its' cooperation with the unions that represent NPS employees. Unions are considered essential to the success of the program and are sources of employee referrals. The Contractor shall demonstrate sensitivity to and familiarity with union issues. IV.

<DESC>The Library of Congress provides information services to various constituencies through twenty-two reading rooms organized around distinct collections and unique resources. The reading rooms provide services different hours of the day and different days of the week, the schedule for each reading room being based on many factors.  Generally, the reading rooms do not duplicate services relating to their collections or provide access to other reading room’s collections. The reading rooms employ subject and resource specialists relating to their unique collections who guide, direct and interpret the resources for researchers. 

The Library’s reading rooms are organized by (1) geographic regions of the world (European, African and Middle Eastern, and Asian), (2) format (microform, manuscript, Newspaper and Current Periodical, Prints and Photographs), (3) client (La Follette  Congressional Reading Room), (4) subject (history and social sciences, law, music, science and technology, and business), and (5) special format (rare book).

The Library’s reading rooms compile and report statistics reflecting usage of the facilities and collections that are incorporated in various reports to internal offices and external organizations.  However, each reading room compiles and reports statistical information differently, resulting in inconsistent and misleading statistical reports.

In 2003, the Library’s Inspector General completed an audit conducted to analyze space utilization in relation to client usage of the Library’s reading rooms, during which the inconsistencies of compiling statistical information was criticized.  To address the criticism, the Library requires a contractor to analyze the statistical compilation and reporting practices in each reading room and propose different methodology options for consistently compiling and reporting similar information.  Further, the Library requires a space utilization and space configuration analysis of each reading room, and an analysis documenting usage trends at various times of the day and days of the week.   To complete these tasks, the Library plans to award a fixed-price task order based on defined deliverables within established time frames.  The Library seeks to complete Project A immediately with the right to exercise the option to complete Project B at a later time.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>DRILLING, GROUTING AND CUTOFF WALL INDUSTRY DAY for Clearwater Dam Major Rehabilitation, Missouri.  The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has conducted national market research by holding a Industry Forum to seek Industrial capability and input into  how to approach the project consisting of construction of a positive seepage cutoff wall at Clearwater Dam in Southeast Missouri.  Seepage has been evident at Clearwater Dam dating back to its completion in the 1940s, and several projects have been constr ucted throughout its life to attempt to control seepage.  In January 2003, a sinkhole appeared in the upstream face of the dam, emphasizing the need to control seepage under and through the dam.  A drilling and grouting program was implemented in the immed iate vicinity of the sinkhole, and was completed in Spring 2005.  The Major Rehabilitation Project (Cutoff Wall) project will be conducted in two phases.  Phase I consists of exploratory drilling and grouting along the entire length of the proposed cutoff wall location.  This type of work is highly technical in nature and will provide enormous amounts of valuable data to be used in the design and construction of the proposed cutoff wall (Phase II).  Related to this effort are several other work items that w ill be accomplished for Phase I, including clearing and grubbing, work platform and access road construction, excavation and fill placement, and establishing turf.  Phase II will consist of construction of the cutoff wall, the length and depth of which wil l be determined, in part, by the data gathered during Phase I.  Phase II will include construction of additional work platform, as dictated by the work method by the selected contractor, and restoring the site upon completion of the cutoff wall. This program is not restricted and is open to both large and small business participation under NAICS codes 237 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction (237990) and Specialty Trade Contractors (238190, 238910, 238990).  This announcement is being broadcas ted to several of the above NAICS codes to ensure that it has the widest dissemination as possible.  It is intended to reach as many interested parties as possible. The Industry Day Forum will be held: September 15, 2005 in Little Rock, Arkansas at the Little Rock District office, 700 W. Capital Avenue, DE Conference Room, 7th Floor.  The Forums will Start Promptly at 1:00 PM and end at 4:00 PM LOCAL TIME.  Assembly w ill take place starting at 12:30 PM.  You are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to register yourself and any other participants from your firm (THERE IS NO FEE).  This may be done by emailing Dudley Smith at Dudley.A.Smith@us.army.mil.  The email must contain the followi ng information:  Firm Name, Firm Address, POC Information, Are you a Joint Venture? Will your firm be attending the Industry Forum?  Number of attendees, the Names of those individuals attending, email addresses, and Phone numbers. USACE encourages small business joint ventures or team arrangements.  SBA has provided flexibility for two or more small businesses to form a contract team for the purpose of competing for a contract while still maintaining small business status even thoug h the team as a whole would exceed the designated small business size standard for the procurement.  Obtain additional information and guidance from your Small Business Administrative Office. Point of Contact Email your questions to US Army Engineer District, Little Rock at Dudley.A.Smith@us.army.mil.

PURPOSE:  

The purpose of this acquisition is to support the development of training modules and the delivery of training on behalf of the Office of Policy, Planning and Budget’s (OPPB’s) Planning & Performance Measurement and Extramural Policy Teams.  This procurement will enhance the ability of the OPPB to address, coordinate, and implement its activities in a timely and effective manner.  In particular, projects will focus on training for members of SAMHSA’s National Advisory Council and Advisory Council on Women’s Services, as well as for SAMHSA staff on updates to extramural policies and the grant planning process.

<DESC>The Bay Pines VA Medical Center anticipates awarding a sole source procurement to Simplex Grinnell of Tampa, Florida for installing the Executone Care Com II-E nurse call system in the VA Bay Pines Nursing Home sections E and G.  Scope of work includes replacement of existing Dukane Nurse Call system with Executone Care Com II-E Nurse Call system. New system is a device-for-device replacement, with one additional single patient station located in room D-8 of attached building 101. Replacement consists of 54 dual patient stations, 13 single patient stations, 56 emergency stations, 2 nurse control stations, 2 nurse follower stations, 1 central equipment cabinet, and all associated peripheral devices, cabling, conduit, back boxes, cover plates, and any other components necessary. Materials for the installation are being purchased through Simplex Grinnel off their GSA contract. Installation will include installing the new main cabinet for the nurse call system in a new room being built by the VA in the dining room.  Disconnect device circuits to the areas being remodeled; demo the existing nurse call panel and install a blank cover over the old cabinet; replace all the existing nurse call devices with new devices one for one in the same locations as the existing. Add a new patient and emergency station in the laundry area connected to area E.  This will have intercom capability. Install a complete raceway system for the new or relocated devices only.

OFFERORS MUST SUBMIT PROOF OF SUCH CURRENT DESIGNATION WITH THEIR OFFERS. SAFETY ANALYTICS FLIGHT STANDARDS CERTIFICATION AND SURVEILLANCE DIVISION AFS-900 Background: The FAA is responsible for maintaining safety surveillance over the United States national aviation system.  In order to enhance it's capability to perform this statutory mission, the FAA has developed and implemented information technology based systems designed to collect, maintain, monitor and analyze aviation safety data. The United States Congress recently provided direction to the FAA to enhance these capabilities via House Report 108-671 - Departments of Transportation And Treasury And Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2005. The Report directed the FAA to improve aviation safety by acquiring state-of-the-art analytical tools. Specifically, the bill states:  "Safety and security analytics project --The recommendation includes $1,000,000 to initiate the safety and security analytics project.  Current software is available to analyze electronic text found in descriptions of accidents, incidents, pilot and controller reports, and other databases to determine trends, patterns, and anomalies earlier than using other methods.  This technology will help FAA meet its long-term goal of reducing the fatal accident rate among air carriers by focusing on long-term trends rather than specific cases." Section 2:  Objective: This SOW shall achieve the following specific objectives: â€¢ Assist the FAA in the development and implementation of an automated aviation centric thesaurus that supports the FAA's safety monitoring and surveillance programs. â€¢ Assist the FAA in the demonstration of a text-mining analytical tool.

<DESC>Modification 1:  The solicitation for a Horsepower Upgrade to an Electric Dynamometer has now been posted to the website www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.



The National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Ann Arbor, Michigan seeks an experienced vendor to upgrade one of our existing Light Duty Vehicle (LDV) 48? single roll electric dynamometers, which were installed by Horiba Instruments in 1992-96. The vendor shall provide the two essential components of this retrofit - the physical hardware and software changes and the expertise to engineer, install, calibrate, and verify the complete system.  The physical changes involve a new AC flux vectored power converter and drive to enable higher horsepower capability.   The existing motor, load cell, rolls, and all mechanical components of the LDV-48? machine will be retained, but the upgraded system will require new calibration and parameter changes to adjust the response tuning after the electrical power upgrade. The subsystems shall be installed and integrated with the existing Horiba RTM-200 microcomputer and CDC 900 controller systems that control the performance of the dynamometer. Any parameter or software changes shall be completed by the vendor and the performance of the overall system shall be verified by an acceptance test procedure. The North American Industry Classification Code is 334513 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  A written solicitation, PR-CI-05-10719, is anticipated to be issued on Wednesday 5/04/05.  It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued as a request for proposals (RFP).  All responsible business sources may submit a quotation in response to the solicitation which shall be considered by the Agency.  This procurement will be pursued using FAR Part 12 Commercial Acquisition methods and procedures.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  A site visit opportunity will be announced in the solicitation it will take place on a date to be determined at the installation site: US EPA, National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory, 2565 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105.  The Agency intends for this event to constitute the sole site visit opportunity for prospective offerors.  The Agency is under no obligation to make accommodations for those unable to attend the site visit event as scheduled.  Additional specifications, and background information, will be made available along with the solicitation.    The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. An offer must include the minimum requirements of the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  In addition to price, the following factors will be used to evaluate the offeror?s technical proposal: responsiveness to the PWS,  previous experience, schedule and delivery.  Award will be made to the offor that represents the Best Value.  Contract type will be firm fixed price.

<DESC>Following Questions have been received.  Answers are hereby provided.

Question 1:  Is there a specific format required for responses?

Answer:  No specified format. Request a logical, parallel to the RFI description and identify the stated objectives being addressed by each recommended product or approach described.


Question 2:  What time on August 30 are responses due?

Responses are due 5 P.M. CST on 30 Aug 2005

Question 3: Is this a new opportunity or a re-competition?  If a re-compete could you provide the incumbent name and contract award number?

Answer: The knowledge base (approaches for integration) is new.  The PROACT portion is re-compete, and Inuit/KEVRIC Joint Venture is the incumbent.  Web University is supported by Booz Allen Hamilton.  Decision to re-compete the Web University will depend on approaches identified in response to the RFI.

Special Note:  This is only a Request for Information not a Request for Quote.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request. 

Specific information such as contract number can be obtained through the Brooks City Base Freedom of Information Office.  Response due date will not be extended.




This Request for Information (RFI) seeks to support strategy development to increase effectiveness of the PROACT Environmental Information Clearinghouse service.  PROACT supports dissemination of information and knowledge that contributes to AFCEE's efforts to develop, establish, implement and sustain leding-edge techniques. A specific objective of this RFI is to support creation of a virtual library on technical environmental resources that will be integrated into the fabric of HQ AFCEE. The environmental information exchange service should function as maps and Yellow Pages that point to knowledge but do not contain knowledge.  The virtual library concept is viewed as part of a core knowledge infrastructure supporting all programs, domains, and disciplines consistent with AFCEE’s roles and responsibilities including PROACT and the existing Air Force environmental training program, AFCEE/TDE Web University, hosted on the HQ AFCEE web site.  Additional objectives of this information support program are:  to communicate environmentally relevant Air Force guidance and policy; to facilitate development of technical guidance by discovery and delivery of relevant technical information that supports subject matter experts; to assist teams of professionals in conducting root-cause analysis; developing collaborative solutions to technical requirements, and quality evaluations.  Information received will be used for strategic planning functions that include: defining core infrastructure requirements; change and enhancement of the PROACT Information Clearinghouse program; change and enhancement of Web University; identification and deployment of measurement systems, program analysis, planning, and development; benchmarking and process migration.  The enhanced system must be responsive, accurate, flexible, and offer value-added products.

Requested information should consider both human and technical attributes for integration of data, documents, web sites, publications and subject matter experts.  The approach will address information/knowledge requirements identified in the PROACT Information needs assessment; the AFCEE IT Strategy Report as well as advances in knowledge management and lessons learned within the Portal, GCSS-AF, AF Knowledge Now, and the DoD’s Network Centric Enterprise Service (NCES) Architecture.   The resulting AFCEE strategy must support conduct of the organization’s mission.  The overarching objective of this RFI is to develop approaches to revise and update information and data systems to better identify the most appropriate contextual knowledge, not necessarily the most readily available, consistent with advances in the practice of knowledge management techniques.

Provide recommendations and conceptual approaches including but not limited to, techniques, software and hardware, as well as processes and procedures for developing an automated system for information management and process integration.  Consider:  management of data, information and knowledge contained in internal and external documents and databases; personnel resources of the Air Force and AFCEE, approaches to “mine” organizational data and information and/or knowledge sources in order to improve business practices.

PROACT

The Air Force (AF) PROACT Environmental Information Exchange service has been in operation since October 1992 and has answered over 25,000 technical inquiries from AF military and civilian personnel, with customers at every organizational level from installation personnel to the Secretary of Air Force (SAF).  The PROACT environmental information exchange helps Air Force personnel and current Air Force contractors meet pollution prevention goals and maintain environmental compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations. The PROACT information researcher currently provides answers to technical inquiries using databases; publications; library services; expert consultants from industry, AF, DoD, United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), as well as state and local regulatory agencies as appropriate.  Tracking and documentation of customer data includes personal data and information from past inquiries, customer contacts, date of response to the customer, and time spent preparing response.  

Problem Definition: How do we create new capabilities consistent with Air Force Portal requirements to assist the end-to-end AFCEE business intelligence and analysis processes in addressing the Knowledge Discovery challenges while laying a foundation for the technologies of tomorrow?  This problem includes the following elements:

1. Massive, heterogeneous, unstructured, scattered, and unreliable data
2. Identification of complex, time-critical concepts
3. Capabilities for evolving user defined agents to assist in hypothesis investigation and “what-if” scenarios
The massive amounts of input data must be selected and presented in a way that drives the discovery and maximum use of the knowledge desired.  To do this, the volume of data must be reduced and filtered so that users are only provided with relevant data.  The approach must be sufficiently flexible to take advantage of current technology and allow phased upgrade of the initial capability to achieve interoperability with future advances.  Recommendations should include the evaluation of indigenous Air Force Portal Capabilities, off-the-shelf software, hardware and information/knowledge management techniques in order to optimize information and knowledge exchange.

Information products must communicate known guidance and policy, support Air Force Program Managers, comply with Department of Defense policy and guidance, and promote use of DoD sources and tools databases.   Information products and sources should be searchable using key words and concepts while remaining appropriately accessible for management evaluation.   The process must include metrics to identify and track customer-based priority targets that require special emphasis.  Information products should address key issues of importance such as recent rule-making activities, and regulatory updates or summarize technical responses to inquiries of general interest which are designed to reach the broadest range of Air Force callers and installations.  The information system should support development of solutions to previously unanswered problems including discovery of relevant, state-of-science information as well as identify subject matter experts.  The information developed and maintained in the system should be proactively diffused using multi-media cross feed products that are responsive to needs of the Air Force environmental community and promote corroboration in application of knowledge.  All products must be consistent with AFCEE policies and quality standards.
GOALS 
In support of AFCEE’s efforts to develop, establish, implement and sustain best-available techniques, this RFI is seeking responses that provide recommendations for: 
 
1. Using state-of-the-art technology to develop enhanced information discovery along with environmental library resource management techniques that support the Environmental Information Clearing house program.
2. Suggested methods to collect, index (with a systematic numbering system) and file information from vendors and/or AF personnel concerning environmental technologies or products which could be implemented at military installations.  The expected result is the development of a content aggregation, organization, and discovery capability consistent with the policy, goals, and directives of the U. S. Air Force CIO concerning the Air Force Portal and methods for content management.
3. Methods for tracking usage of the information service, monitoring and assessing customer awareness of program services, effectiveness, customer satisfaction and identifying information needs.  Please include recommend approaches (such as advertising) or initiatives to maintain awareness and relevance of the service to Air Force stakeholders.
4. Approaches for database management, security access control, indexing, search, and geospatial software/standards, security certification and accreditation, along with any integration services necessary to complete system development.
5. Approaches to employ outside technical publications, services, subscriptions, licenses and other methods for streamlining access to technical and professional publications, guidance documents, as well as the policy, regulations and instructions which are essential for accomplishing the AFCEE mission.  Please incorporate recommendations with regard to design, modeling, selection, and implementation of technical information management systems necessary to advance the basic capabilities from both a hardware and software perspective.
6. Approaches to coordinate and leverage reporting of current events, communication, outreach and training related to topic areas such as:  Web University, Technology, Performance Based Management (PBM), Remedial System Optimization (RPO), Waste Management, Pollution Prevention, Sustainability, Natural Resources, and Cultural Resources.

WEB UNIVERSITY

The WebU system automates training delivery, stores, manages, and delivers information and tools, provides access to environmental information and resources, and serves as a portal to other environmental education and training resources and providers. WebU resides on two servers and operates in a Structured Query Language (SQL) relational database environment, which allows users to interact with the Environmental Education and Training (EET) database through an interface consisting of HTML, JavaScript, and Active Server Pages.  WebU scripts allow users to enter, edit, and track environmental education and training data equal to the user’s level of permission and generate a variety of real-time reports.

The EET database consist of 20+ tables containing Air Force occupational series and job codes, performance-based tasks, regulatory mandates, unit equipment codes, training source information, course content, student and faculty information, and other data required to generate the Web University website.  The EET database functions as a Learning and Content Management System (LCMS or LMS) to deliver:  automated registration and authentication of student and faculty members; user ID and password management; management and delivery of course content; student activity tracking; test generation and scoring, and certificate management.  Reports generated by the database include web trends, user and course reports, the Area of Responsibility Checklist for overseas theaters, Air Force Environmental Task List, and the DoD Sources and Tools Catalog.  Authorized users are also able to upload documents such as meeting Minutes and briefings for long-term storage.

PROACT currently supports Web University through cross feed of requested Web University educational materials and collection of feedback forms and information.

Problem Definition: How do we integrate current and new capabilities to most effectively leverage resource to optimize information and training support; increase customer access, and streamline access, registration and other interactions?

GOALS
In support of AFCEE’s efforts to develop, establish, implement and sustain best-available techniques, This RFI is seeking responses that provide recommendations for:
1. Using state of the art technology that will support distance learning.  
2. Managing student enrollment, delivery of training content, assessment of training effectiveness, curriculum development, course content management, and collaboration with external activities that provide relevant training.
3. Provide recommendations that will more fully integrate environmental information clearinghouse and environmental education and training activities.
4. Consolidating and integrating data contained in PRO-ACT and Air Force Environmental Education and Training databases to minimize duplication of effort, share resources, and provide on-line access to information and resources through the appropriate forum (i.e. PRO-ACT, WebU Library, etc.).  Consideration should be given to identifying and including information in the DoD Sources and Tools Database, referencing in WebU courses, and featuring in the WebU Spotlight to alert users to noteworthy events, news, and information.
5. Approaches for supporting WebU students and users.  Areas of consideration should include, but not be limited to, WebU Help Desk; recommended initial point of contact for content related questions; maintaining course links and references; monitoring and updating regulatory references contained in the Environmental Master Task List and Area of Responsibility Checklists, and identifying obsolete and additional tasks.
6. Approaches for developing and maintaining Environmental Facts Sheets or information summaries.  For example, a subject-specific Facts Sheet prepared as single or double sided information sheets with charts, graphs, and brief statements related to a specific topic or program.  Provide recommendation for approaches to select topics warranting information summary development; determining the appropriate number of summaries, and process to efficiently maintain current accurate content for all AFCEE program areas.

<DESC>Expedited Modernization Initiative Procedure (EMIP) Process Description and Objective The EMIP, a key part of the Armys Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Transformational Strategy, is a multi-phased, continuous process designed to improve the current and future Tactical Wheeled Vehicles TWV fleet by identifying and leveraging industrys investments  in advanced technologies.  Under the lead of the Project Manager for Tactical Wheeled Vehicles PM TWV, the goal of EMIP is to educate Government representatives about these technologies.  The advantage of the EMIP process is that it provides both the Gove rnment and the contractor a single point of contact. The current TWV fleet is composed of the M915 Series of Trucks, Palletized Load System PLS, Heavy Equipment Transporter HET, Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck HEMTT, Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles FMTV, and High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehi cle HMMWV families of vehicles, as well as all associated trailers.  This process applies to those vehicles that PM TWV manages.  The Tank-automotive & Armaments Command TACOM Integrated Logistics Support Center ILSC manages vehicles no longer in productio n as well as all spares.  Suggestions concerning vehicles no longer in production and managed by ILSC will be directed to the appropriate item manager.  Desired Capabilities PM TWV is seeking technologies that will improve the capabilities of the current or future fleet.  The Expedited Modernization Initiative Procedure EMIP places emphasis on technologies that address solutions in the following warfighting capabilities: ·	Safety; ·	Survivability; ·	Reliability, Maintainability, and Sustainability; ·	Distribution and Mission Enhancements. Although the Government is interested in learning about any ideas/concepts to improve the fleet, the EMIP process will mainly address those technologies that can be available for production within six-months of completion of verification testing and are te chnologies that are new to the Army have not already been demonstrated in its current configuration.  Process Contractors are requested to make their submissions to the Government via Mailbox TruckTech@tacom.army.mil mailto:TruckTech@tacom.army.mil.  The concept submitted should be at Technology Readiness Level TRL, see Appendix A 8 or better.  In almost all cases , TRL 8 represents the end of true system development.  The concept should also not be one that has already been demonstrated to Government representatives in its current configuration.  The format for this submission shall be in accordance with IAW Append ix B.  Once the Government confirms receipt, the EMIP process will continue as follows:  ·	Review written documentation and view the technology capability within 90 days of receipt.  The Government will review for applicability as well as technical readiness level. ·	If the Government determines that the technology is appropriate for demonstration, that vendor will be provided a recommendation for demonstration and/or request for additional data. ·	If the Government determines that the proposal is not a candidate for the EMIP process, then a recommendation will be provided to the contractor. In the event that the Government determines that a demonstration is appropriate, two alternatives are available.  The value of the demonstrations is that contractors can provide a much more persuasive case for the technology than can be provided by written  documentation alone. The following is the basic flow of the demonstration process: ·	Continuous - Location to be determined by contractor with Government concurrence e.g.: Government proving ground, private proving ground, contractors facility.  This alternative offers more flexibility for schedule.  However, the Government participatio n will be more limited than with the scheduled technology modernization demonstration because only one demonstration will be ongoing. The conduct of this demonstration may be recorde d in order to facilitate further review.  The advantage of this process is that results of this observation will be reviewed and considered on a continuous basis rather than incurring a potential delay due to waiting to demonstrate in the Annual demonstrat ion. . ·	Government Technology Modernization Demonstration 2nd Annual - The 2nd Component Technology Demonstration will be conducted at Yuma Proving Ground YPG, Arizona, January 23-27, 2006.   Although the EMIP process is a continuous process and contractors may submit concepts at any time during the calendar year, in order to be considered for the annual demonstration submissions must have been received no later than NLT 1 November 2005. This cutoff date is necessary to allow for time to review the technology for  applicability as well as to coordinate resources at YPG. The potential advantage of this demonstration is that it has in the past been attended by general officer leadership involved with the TWV modernization process who, in addition to the IPT, was pres ent to witness the demonstrations.   Additional information about electronic registration, Visitor Security Information, Yuma Test Capabilities, a Frequently Asked Questions document and a Yuma Map will be posted later on the below TACOM web site. It must be stressed that all such demonstrations are both optional and at the expense of the contractor.  The demonstration of items will in no way express or imply an obligation by the Government to purchase or otherwise acquire the items demonstrated or displayed.  Moreover, the Government is not bound or obligated in any way to give special consideration to any demonstrating vendor on future contracts as a result of the EMIP process or demonstration.  It must be emphasized that this process is not a sour ce selection, but instead a means to identify and leverage Industrys investments through the Market Research process.  Upon completion of the demonstration, the Government will make an internal acquisition approach decision. TWV System Rodeo The EMIP process and technology modernization demonstrations are focused primarily on component technologies.  However, the system rodeo is distinct from component demonstrations and will occur in July 2006 to specifically focus on complete, integrated veh icle solutions.  At this time, vendors may choose to demonstrate their individual EMIP components on a full-up system.  Please continue to monitor the below website for more information on EMIP and the TWV System Rodeo. http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/ssn/sources.htm Conclusion The key advantage of the EMIP process is that it provides a focused, standardized approach to introducing new capabilities to PM Tactical Wheeled Vehicles. PM TWV welcomes all technological ideas or concepts and would like to thank all industry participant s for their commitment to the improvement of the TWV fleet.  Appendix A:  Technology Readiness Levels TRLs and their Definitions The following matrix lists the various technology readiness levels and descriptions from a systems approach for both Hardware and Software.  DoD Components may provide additional clarifications for Software.  Supplemental definitions follow the table. Technology Readiness Level TRL Description	 1.  Basic principles observed and reported.	Lowest level of technology readiness.  Scientific research begins to be translated into applied research and development.  Examples might include paper studies of a technologys basic properties.	 2.  Technology concept and or application formulated.	Invention begins.  Once basic principles are observed, practical applications can be invented.  Applications are speculative and there may be no proof or detailed analysis to support the assumptions.  E xamples are limited to analytic studies.	 3.  Analytical and experimental critical function and or characteristic proof of concept. Active research and development is initiated.  This includes analytical studies and labora tory studies to physically validate analytical predictions of separate elements of the technology.  Examples include components that are not yet integrated or representative.	 4.  Component and or breadboard validation in laboratory environment.	Basic technological components are integrated to establish that they will work together.  This is relatively low fidelity compared to the eventual system.  Examples include integration  of ad hoc hardware in the laboratory.	 5.  Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment. Fidelity of breadboard technology increases significantly.  The basic technological components are integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so it can be tested in a simulat ed environment.  Examples include high fidelity laboratory integration of components.	 6.  System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment.	Representative model or prototype system, which is well beyond that of TRL 5, is tested in a relevant environment.  Represents a major step up in a technologys demonstrated r eadiness.  Examples include testing a prototype in a high-fidelity laboratory environment or in simulated operational environment.	 7.  System prototype demonstration in an operational environment.	Prototype near, or at, planned operational system.  Represents a major step up from TRL 6, requiring demonstration of an actual system prototype in an operational environment such as an airc raft, vehicle, or space.  Examples include testing the prototype in a test bed aircraft.	 8.  Actual system completed and qualified through test and demonstration.	Technology has been proven to work in its final form and under expected conditions.  In almost all cases, this TRL represents the end of true system development.  Examples include de velopmental test and evaluation of the system in its intended weapon system to determine if it meets design specifications.	 9.  Actual system proven through successful mission operations.	Actual application of the technology in its final form and under mission conditions, such as those encountered in operational test and evaluation.  Examples include using the system under oper ational mission conditions.	 DEFINITIONS: BREADBOARD:  Integrated components that provide a representation of a system subsystem and which can be used to determine concept feasibility and to develop technical data.  Typically configured for laboratory use to demonstrate the technical principles of  immediate interest.  May resemble final system/subsystem in function only. HIGH FIDELITY:  Addresses form, fit and function.  High-fidelity laboratory environment would involve testing with equipment that can simulate and validate all system specifications within a laboratory setting. LOW  FIDELITY:  A representative of the component or system that has limited ability to provide anything but first order information about the end product.  Low-fidelity assessments are used to provide trend analysis. MODEL:  A functional form of a system, generally reduced in scale, near or at operational specification.  Models will be sufficiently hardened to allow demonstration of the technical and operational capabilities required of the final system. OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT:  Environment that addresses all of the operational requirements and specifications required of the final system to include platform/packaging. PROTOTYPE:  A physical or virtual model used to evaluate the technical or manufacturing feasibility or military utility of a particular technology or process, concept, end item or system. RELEVANT ENVIRONMENT:  Testing environment that simulates the key aspects of the operational environment. SIMULATED OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL:  Either 1) a real environment that can simulate all of the operational requirements and specifications required of the final system, or 2) a simulated environment that allows for testing of a virtual prototype; used in eith er case to determine whether a developmental system meets the operational requirements and specifications of the final system. Appendix B: Technology Application Idea (TAI) EMIP Submission Contractors will initially submit the following information that briefly describes the idea/technology and the estimated benefits and costs.  Using Microsoft Word, list the complete Contact Information for this Technology Application Idea (TAI): Name of Company: Address of Company: Name of Technology Application Idea: Primary Contact Person for this TAI: Primary Contact Persons email: Primary Contact Persons Phone number: Main Capability Addressed by this Technology: ·	Safety ·	Survivability ·	Reliability, Maintainability, and Sustainability ·	Distribution and Mission Enhancements Provide a brief description of the technology: What are the primary benefits of this technology?

<DESC>NASA/ARC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for a Cabinet Orthovoltage x-ray machine to irradiate cells in culture and anesthetized mice.  This procurement must include x-ray machine, shipping, installation, training, calibration options, and a service contract  NASA/ARC intends to purchase this x-ray machine from the following company: Willick Engineering Company, Inc. 12516 Lakeland Road, Santa Fe Springs, CA 90670, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1. Willick Engineering has a unique ability to meet all our specifications for this Cabinet Orthovoltage X-ray machine.   The specifications are as follows: 1.	Supply a constant direct current potential somewhere within the range of 220-300 kVcp so that irradiation of samples occurs within a high enough voltage range and thereby cells deep within biological tissues receive the required dose at a rate of ~1 Gy/minute 2.	Possess a high homogeneity x-ray tube so that multiple samples within the chamber be irradiated uniformly and reproducibly; the x ray dose should not vary more than ±5% within a 30° cone perpendicular to the tube axis.  This is needed to avoid large deviations in response to irradiation between samples and intervals of irradiation. 3.	Include pre-calibrated sensor and software for dosimetry so that the x-ray dose and dose rate are calibrated 4.	Be a self-contained cabinet to meet safety requirements (Federal Title 21CFR 1020.40 "Cabinet X-Ray Systems") and also thereby to avoid the need to provide shielding to the room that houses the machine. 5.	Include a sample turntable with variable speed capability within the chamber so that samples are irradiated evenly 6.	Possess a chamber size large enough to irradiate at desired dosage and to hold both biological samples in culture dishes and anesthetized mice (minimum dimensions ~ 20 in X 20 in X 35 in). 7.	Include both a filter holder and a standard set of aluminum and copper filters (capacity of holder for 2mm Al filter to provide 120R/min at 50 cm from source at 10 mAmp); these are needed to avoid injury to the skin of mice during irradiation. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  Interested parties having the capabilities and qualifications necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  This product is non-commercial. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.  The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto. All responses shall be submitted to Patricia Finnell-Mendoza no later than 4:30 PM PST on 09/9/2005. For any technical question please submit them to Ruth Globus 650-604-5247 or e-mail technical questions to Ruth.K.Globus@nasa.gov.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) 1.	PURPOSE: The Government is soliciting responses from industry as to their specific capabilities in the area of manufacturing, systems integration, system test and derivative production activities. This effort is in support of urgent operational and warf ighter needs in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and countering the RCIED. 2.	BACKGROUND: The system is currently in production and is under contract to the Government for that effort.  At the current time, the Government is investigating alternative means of meeting increased system production to satisfy higher rate production  quantities, and expedited delivery to the OIF/OEF operational theaters.   3.	SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: The System is a wideband ECM device comprised of a Receiver/Transmitter (R/T) subsystem consisting of a chassis with five circuit card assemblies (CCA), power amplifiers, power conditioning. The system design is current, state-of-t he-art design with surface mount, multi-layer CCAs, with embedded firmware/FPGA controlling system operation in two modes: as an active transmitter and in a reactive mode. There is an associated Remote Control Unit (RCU) for remote operation via direct cab le interface to the R/T unit. An antenna and associated RF cables are part of the system configuration, as are a ruggedized PDA and Laptop, and associated software which may be provided in support of the production effort. 4.	SYSTEM BASELINE: Drawings will be made available for production, integration, and test of the system but NOT in a final form, i.e. validated through a Functional Configuration Audit (FCA) or Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) nor a Design Verification T est (DVT).   However, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and the Government will verify all aspects of the system performance and design during a First Article Test (FAT) and Operational Assessment (OA) to validate the design and the drawing package  as an entry into high/full rate production. This includes firmware/software documentation, test plans and procedures, environmental stress screen (acceptance testing) of the system. The drawing package includes test plans and procedures for subassembly test of the completed CCA via automated and manual process and stress screening of lower level assemblies. Specification or Source Control Documents for system unique, high performance requirements are part of the drawing package. It is expected that this drawing package will be provided to the follower for their use in executing the proposed production effort.  Close Interaction with the Leader will be required due to the immaturity of the technical data. 5.	GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: Provide a secondary production, integration, test and delivery capability based on the following: a.	Production/manufacturing directly or via subcontracting approaches, the critical essential system elements: CCAs, power amplifiers, chassis etc based on the drawing package in a collaborative leader follower relationship. b.	Integration and test of the R/T & RCU based on developed Acceptance Test Procedures c.	Environmental Stress Screening (ESS)/Production Acceptance Test (PAT) based on developed test plans and procedures. This will require single or multiple test chambers capable of meeting composite temperature/vibration profiles (example: QualMark Typho on 4.0 System). d.	An existing production infrastructure for complex electronics systems manufacturing, production, integration and test to include Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment in the RF ranges to NLT 10 Ghz. e.	Demonstrated performance in the manufacturing, production, integration and test of electronic countermeasure systems (ECM), electronic support measures (ESM), or signals intelligence (SIGINT) systems. f.	An ability to achieve a nominal sustained systems delivery production rate of 600 systems per month, and not less than 1000 systems per month peak ( under surge/acceleration).  g.	Current qualification and certification under ISO9000 or ANSI equivalent. h.	A current Facility Clearance for processing, generation and storage of classified material to the SECRET/No Foreign Dissemination level. Key personnel shall be cleared to the SECRET clearance level. No foreign dissemination includes the use of non-natur alized residents on work visas.  i.	A preliminary/transition Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPIF) phase in which the production line, methods, processes and procedures are developed based on information and drawings provided by the OEM and the line is validated and a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) phas e for systems production and delivery to the Government. 6.	RESPONSE AND INFORMATION REQUIRED a.	NAICS Classification b.	FSCM Code c.	CAGE Code d.	Date and currency of offerors facility clearance e.	Brief description of current or past performance in the areas identified in 5.e above f.	Based on the information provided in Paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 above: i.	Describe or characterize your ability to meet the identified requirements. ii.	Constraints in meeting the identified requirements iii.

<DESC>This Sources Sought posting is intended to determine industry interest in the Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E) Program, as described below.  Interested parties shall submit their interest, certified business size (e.g. Large Business, or Small Busine ss) in accordance with NAICS Code 541330, and questions regarding the upcoming acquisition of the JT&E Program via email to: Jack.L.Peterson@mvk02.usace.army.mil.  In order to provide efficient and effective responses to contractor questions, the VCCO requ ests that all contractor questions be submitted via the aforementioned email address, and not by telephone.  Please note this Sources Sought posting expires on 02-Sep-2005 at 1600 hours (Central Time Zone).  This competition is a follow-on effort which wil l be a vehicle for the Deputy Director, Air Warfare (AW), in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (Director, Operational Test and Evaluation) (OSD(DOT&E)) to provide support to the JT&E Program.  The OSD sponsors the JT&E Program to conduct tests and eva luations and provide information required by Congress, OSD, the Unified Commands, and Department of Defense (DOD) components relative to joint operations.  Congress established the JT&E Program in 1972 after a Presidential Commission concluded that the DOD  had no capability to conduct test and evaluation in a joint environment.  The objective of a JT&E is to (a) assess Service system interoperability; (b) evaluate joint technical and operational concepts and recommend improvements; (c) validate testing meth odologies that have multi-Service applications; (d) improve Modeling and Simulation (M&S) applications; (e) increase joint mission capability, using quantitative data for analysis; and (f) provide feedback to the acquisition and joint operations communitie s.  The program is responsible for providing or obtaining technical and engineering support across the range of test activities.  Test activities include test design; planning/execution and reporting.  Specific activities include:  test, engineering, plann ing; modeling and simulation, training, programming, data collection and analysis, hardware and software configuration and documentation, programming, integrated logistics support, resource and program control, and development of briefings, test results, a nd technical reports.  The JT&E process is composed of three separated but closely related activities: (a) the nomination, coordination and consideration of the nomination for inclusion in the JT&E Program; (b) a Joint Feasibility Study (JFS) determination  of the need and feasibility of approved nominations; and (c) the chartered joint tests (JT&E) which are the execution of these approved nominations that show potential for significant improvements in joint military capabilities.  This acquisition will sup port both the JFS and the JT&E part of this process.  Also supported are Quick Reaction Tests (QRT), which are short duration (approximately one year) tests in response to Warfighter emergent requirements, and Tests and Evaluation (T&E), which function lik e JT&E but do not involve joint capabilities.  The JT&E Program has a requirement for technical and engineering support across the range of test activities to include the preparation of technical reports, test design and planning, field test activities, da ta collection, data processing and analysis, hardware and software configuration and documentation, programming, analysis of system performance and related data, modeling and simulation, training, instrumentation and facilities, integrated logistic support , resource and program control, verification, validation and accreditation.  All contract work is currently being provided by task orders awarded through five indefinite delivery contracts.  The total cost for the five-year period on the current contracts,  which ends 30-Sep-2006, is estimated to be $400 million.  A task order on each of the five indefinite delivery contracts currently provides program office supp ort instrumental in the JFS/JT&E nomination/selection process.  Due to the appearance of possible conflict of interest issues, this program office support effort will be pursued as a completely separate acquisition.  Please note the program office support Sources Sought posting on FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov/) will be posted in the near future.

<SUBJECT>18 -- Positioning System (GPS) Block IIIA Industry Day #1
<DESC>The Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) Joint Program Office (JPO) will host GPS Block IIIA Industry Days #1 on 7-9 September 2005.  The GPS Joint Program Office will develop and deploy the GPS III System in two separate contractual efforts.  The two efforts will be the operational control segment (OCX) and the space segment (Block IIIA).  The goal of GPS Block III is to provide reliable and secure delivery of enhanced position, velocity and timing signals to military and civil users, while managing long-term total ownership costs.  The GPS Block III effort is focused on design, development, deployment, and operation of future GPS Satellites.  GPS Block III, in tandem with OCX, will achieve long-term GPS performance goals.  It will reduce existing shortcomings and vulnerabilities that impede the ability of GPS to support future military operations and vital civil commerce, transportation, and public safety services.  GPS Block III will fully support the Federal Radionavigation Plan and Federal Radionavigation System, and will address interoperability with all current and planned global radionavigation systems.  GPS Block III will incorporate the space segments of the Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (NDS), the Distress Alerting Satellite System (DASS), and the Space Environmental Detection Payload (SEDP).  GPS Block III will enhance U.S. leadership in space-based navigation to meet the stated Presidential goal of GPS providing the world standard Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) solution. 
The purpose of Industry Day #1 is to provide the GPS Overview of Block III, to include program priorities, an acquisition strategy update, the Block III engineering and integration approach, an overview of the Statement of Objectives (SOO) and a roadmap to get to contract award.

This contract will be procured using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 13, through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-5.

Additionally, the Government requires information on state or local laws that affect recreational and/or commercial effort or that exist specifically to address bycatch of sea turtles in state fisheries.  This effort is in concert with the Government’s authorization and obligation as set forth by the Endangered Species Act 16 U.S.C. 1531 to engage in activities critical to the protection and conservation of endangered and threatened species.  A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file. Reference number: NFFK0000-5-00244.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-05 and DFARs Change Notice (DCN) 20050726.  Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code is 2399and the size standard is 500 employees.  NAICS is 314999.
This acquisition is for Brand Name items only and is a 100% small business set aside.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures (The award will be less than $100,000) will be followed. 

The Brand Name purchase will be for Parachute Canopies as follows: Two (2) Each,  Part # 730500, Performance Design Canopy Sabre2, 170 sq. ft., Silver/Blk;  Six (6) Each,  Part # 730800, Performance Design Canopy Sabre2, 190 sq. ft., Silver/Blk.; One (1) Each,  Part # 730600, Performance Design Canopy Spectra 230, 230 sq. ft., Royal Blue/Silver; Twelve (12) Each, Part # E84193, Performance Design Reserve Canopy, PD-193R, Orange; Two (2) Each, Part# E84218, Performance Design Reserve Canopy,  PD-218R, Orange.  All color scheme layouts will be specified during award. Delivery is Freight FOB Destination Edwards AFB CA 93524.


 The Brand Name Justification follows: The Test Parachutist Program requires the use of Performance Designs Sabre 2 and Performance Designs Spectre canopies due to jump requirements at the AFFTC. These canopies are used to perform Advance Free Fall Trainer duties, Advance Free Fall Maneuvers, Test Jumpmaster duties for Static Line/Free Fall, Aerial Photography for upgrade jumps and test applications. 

Performance Designs is the only manufacturer of this type of canopy. When purchased from Square One Gear Parachute Sales the wait time is 6 to 8 weeks and the time factor is the most important element in regard to replacing current canopies. The Performance Designs Sabre 2 and Spectre canopies are the safest canopies on the market to date and due to the test applications used at AFFTC , safety is paramount. Timeliness in receipt of the new Performance Designs Sabre 2 and Spectre systems is necessary to prevent mission stoppage.

The proposed Brand Name Purchase is the only known source that will meet the Test Parachutist Program and the Air Force requirement.

The steps required to accomplish the above are as follows:

1.	Design and Approval
a.	Based on planning with CBP TV Operations staff, the contractor will develop color conceptual sketches, possible approaches to treatments and layouts for approval. 
b.	Based on the input from CBP TV Operations staff on the initial concept drawings, the contractor will present color renderings, scale ground plans, and material samples of the studio’s environments.
2.	Technical Drawings and Installation Schedule

S. COAST GUARD HU-25 OXYGEN MASK REPAIR/OVERHAUL, STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES

1.0	   BACKGROUND:

The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault Aviation, previously, Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate in salt laden environments.   The EROS Full Face Quick Donning Oxygen Mask, P/N MF10-03-02, manufactured by GIE-EROS, Plaisir, France, was installed in these aircraft in 1991 and serial number tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  This tracking provides a historical record of repair, overhaul, maintenance, and item location and status.  

2.0	  OBJECTIVE:
            
2.1.    The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain the services of the OEM or a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center to effectively repair and overhaul (as defined in paragraph 2) and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 oxygen masks.          Repaired/overhauled oxygen masks must meet the OEM’s specifications and be In  
          Accordance With (IAW) Component Maintenance Manual (CMM) 35-13-61, REV 2, 
          dated 01/31/2003 and Coast Guard Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) HU-25
          935030.0, dated 08/01/1992.  The Coast Guard has placed all oxygen mask parts, with
          the exception of Regulator Assembly, P/N RMC 1007-4, on condition to be replaced as
          necessary.  The Regulator Assembly, P/N RMC1007-4, requires overhaul every six (6)
          years.  GIE-EROS, Plaisir, France is the OEM.        



         The Coast Guard anticipates two (2) levels of repair.  First, a repair is considered as  
          test/inspect/return to service, as necessary.  This work consists of inspection, failure
          analysis, defective part(s) replacement (i.e., Harness Assy., Microphone Assy.,
          Hose Supply Assy., and Mask Assy.), if necessary, and testing to meet the OEM’s
          functional return to service requirements (component time continues).  Secondly, an
          overhaul is considered over and above the repair scope and includes overhaul of the
          regulator assembly and the replacement of additional parts as necessary.  An overhaul
          zeroes the Time Since Overhaul (TSO).  In addition, OEM Dust Cover P/N 59447-00 to     
          Hose Assembly P/N DTS series must be installed for both repair and overhaul.  
          The offeror shall provide a cost breakdown for parts and labor.  At a minimum, these two 
          (2) levels of service should be addressed in the offeror’s technical and cost proposal.  
          Offerors may propose additional levels of service.
           
          The prospective contractor is responsible for all necessary functions to perform the 
          services requested.  This includes, but is not limited to, required tooling, manuals, test 
          equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, 
          preservation, packaging, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul the oxygen masks. 
         
       The prospective contractor’s responsibilities to the Coast Guard ACMS consist of 
       ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component, and that 
       all OEM Service Bulletins and Coast Guard TCTOs remain incorporated upon 
       completion of work.  

       Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level 
                      agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract.  The prospective 
                      contractor will develop, submit and monitor progress using agreed-to performance 
                      metrics and service level agreements.
     
 2.2.   Definitions

                   2.2.1. Level I Repair: Work consists of inspection, failure analysis, defective part(s)  
                                replacement (if necessary) and testing to meet the OEM’s functional return to 
                                service requirements.  Repair does not zero the component time.

                   2.2.2. Level II Repair: Overhaul – considered over and above the Level I Repair scope 
                                and includes overhaul of the regulator assembly and the replacement of additional 
                                parts as necessary.  Overhaul zeros the component Time Since Overhaul (TSO).

4.0    SERVICE BULLETINS

            All service bulletins if not previously accomplished, shall be identified to the Contracting 
            Officer.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining service bulletins.   Upon receipt of an
            oxygen mask requiring incorporation of such service bulletins, the contractor shall prepare a
            firm-fixed-price proposal IAW instructions listed below.  Service bulletins created and
            incorporated during performance of this requirement may create new part number 
            configurations, which supercede the previous configuration.  In cases where the old
            configuration cannot be modified to the new, the new part number shall be added to the
            contract, by written modification.  The contractor shall notify and request disposition
            instructions from the Contracting Officer for superceded parts, which have been removed and
            replaced by new part number configurations.

Upon receipt of notification from the Contracting Officer that a service bulletin is required, the Contractor shall submit, within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notification, a firm-fixed-price proposal for an incremental charge to be assessed each time the service bulletin is incorporated in a component.  The proposal shall contain a breakdown of material and labor costs including hours, labor categories, labor rates, and applicable mark ups.  The incremental charge agreed to for incorporation of a service bulletin shall apply only to those components into which the Contractor incorporates a required service bulletin, not those into which the service bulletin has been previously incorporated.  Upon agreement of an incremental charge and issuance of a contract modification to reflect this change, the service bulletin shall be incorporated into each subsequent component received at the repair facility if said service bulletin has not already been incorporated.  When service bulletin incorporation changes the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) part number, the new part number shall be added to the                     Contract, by written modification.  The same procedures apply if removal of service bulletins is
 required.

52.212-2	Evaluation – Commercial Items (Jan 1999)

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Award will be made utilizing the following factors, in descending order of importance.  The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose quote is identified as offering the best value solution.

                    The Source Selection Team (SST) may determine the best value for the Coast Guard
               merits a higher price based on technical superiority.  The SST, using sound business 
               judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal’s 
               relative capability as measured against the below evaluation factors:

		     Factor 1 – Technical
                       Factor 2 – Performance Metrics
                       Factor 3 – Past Performance
                       Factor 4 – Cost/Price

	         Technical factors 1 and 2 are equal in importance and significantly more important than  
                     factor 3. While the cost/price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the 
                     non-price factors (1, 2 and 3) are significantly more important than the price factor. 
                     However, as technical proposal become substantially equal, price may be the determining 
                     factor in selecting a proposal for award. Any conversations with the present or former 
                     customers will be documented.

Enclosure (1)

DETAILED FACTORS

1.  Technical

Vendors detailed work statement. Evidence and ability to maintain a quality system acceptable to   
 the Coast Guard. Repair must meet the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM) form, fit and 
 function specifications to ensure installation and operational characteristics are met. 

2.  Performance Measures and Metrics

     The performance measures and metrics will be evaluated for the extent they are comprehensive in 
      their ability to quantify, measure, track, and report operational performance relating to both system 
      and management performance as well achievement of Coast Guard objectives, identify the highest 
      level of service consistent with cost effectiveness, and will be tied to performance incentives and 
      disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics.

3.  Past Performance

      Past Performance will consider documentation for having performed repair of similar or like items.
      Past performance will consider the opinions of existing and former customers during the past 2 
      years. The past performance factor will be based on adherence to ability to perform a successful 
      repair, delivery schedule, willingness and ability of contractor to resolve problems. Great care 
      needs to be exercised so that “past performance” information is considered under the appropriate 
      heading and not confused with “technical”.

4.  Price related factors

Compare offered prices against the Government estimate and review each proposal for level of work offered based on number of labor hours, hourly rates and material costs to evaluate price reasonableness.  Determine if the Incentive/Disincentive program offered is acceptable to the USCG.  Evaluating what the program is to measure and how it is to be tracked and monitored.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14 Notice for Filing Agency Protests
                                                                                                                                      




NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
Media Monitoring, Clipping and Analysis Services

I.	BACKGROUND
The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Office of Public Affairs (OPA) is responsible for the effective dissemination of accurate information to the public concerning FEMA’s programs, missions and goals for emergency management. The Office provides primary support to the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Emergency Preparedness and Response, with lead responsibility for the communication of agency goals, objectives and accomplishments.  In addition, the Office is responsible for the preparation and distribution of critical response and recovery information to state and local officials, agency stakeholders, and the general public.

Because of the high profile nature of FEMA’s mission, emergency management-related stories remain prominently featured by media outlets.  The Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Emergency Preparedness and Response, senior FEMA officials, and program managers need to be kept abreast of news coverage relating directly or indirectly to the mission and operations of FEMA as they relate to major disaster declarations, legislative activity and the operations of/about the agency.  They must remain current of issues that could impact FEMA in the future as well as those issues currently being reported. To meet this need, FEMA’s Office of Public Affairs is seeking a contractor to provide full-service clipping and media monitoring support.

II.	SUMMARY OF SUPPORT REQUIRED
FEMA’s Office of Public Affairs is responsible for ensuring agency management has access to timely and relevant information presented in an orderly format required for expeditious review, analysis and response by senior FEMA officials.  The Office of Public Affairs requires a professional company able to compile, evaluate, and analyze stories related to the agency and reported by different media outlets, including those currently obtained from our regional offices, disaster sites, clipping services, and from daily monitoring of major print, broadcast and web media in support of this requirement.

III.	TASKS
1.	Acquire, Edit and Organize Relevant News in a User Friendly Format
The Contractor must be able to provide an immediate overview, synopsis and analysis of the unique factual components of major news stories covered by print, broadcast and web media sources that directly or indirectly affect the program, policies and operation of the FEMA in order to inform the agency’s senior leadership.  

The Contractor shall produce a news summary with full articles and transcripts a minimum of five days a week (Monday through Friday), and in certain periods, seven days a week depending on the extent of current disaster activities, of news relating directly or indirectly to the mission and operation of FEMA and any current disasters as well as the impacts these have on state and communities.  

The clips package must contain a summary of the daily news and must also be organized by subject and immediate importance, as defined by the level of importance and impact to FEMA and the status of the news as reported by major media throughout the country.  The Office of Public Affairs shall provide a technical representative to direct the Contractor in the organization of topics.

Topics currently identified for scanning include, but are not limited to, the following: hurricanes; floods; earthquakes; mudslides; severe winter weather; tornadoes and similar severe weather events; chemical, biological, or radiological acts of terrorism; chemical, biological, or radiological catastrophes; wildfires; and severe droughts, and those disaster related economic or social impacts. The Contractor will also monitor political affairs for possible impact on FEMA.  

The Contractor shall work within, and if required, refine the existing process of collecting relevant news stories and anticipated media coverage information from the ten regional offices and from applicable Disaster Field Offices. Daily summaries must address print, radio, broadcast and online media outlets at the national, regional and local levels, as applicable.

2.	Distribute News Summary
The contractor shall produce a daily news summary in a format that includes a summary; table of contents; and all related articles as a final printable document for distribution to FEMA personnel. Internal distribution will include email to designated employees as well as posting to a password protected/secure location on FEMA’s Internet and Intranet sites. The agency maintain the rights to make unlimited copies and unlimited distribution of the final product electronically or in hardcopy for internal agency use, and to those officials working closely on FEMA’s disaster related issues

The news summary must be available for distribution and online posting between the hours of 5:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m., Monday through Friday, and by 8:00 a.m. on weekends (or as defined by the designated FEMA official).  The product should be delivered daily via e-mail to the designated FEMA official to be distributed to FEMA personnel. 
 

During times of greater coverage of agency activities (e.g. during disaster response operations), the contractor may be required to produce an additional afternoon version of the summary and clips to be distributed by early to mid-afternoon (by 3:00 or 4:00 p.m.).  

3.	Archiving and Analyzing the News
The Contractor shall organize and implement a digital archive catalog, system for the easy retrieval by internal sources of the archived material in a timely manner.  In addition, the contractor shall provide weekly summaries to the Office of Public Affairs providing an analysis and breakdown of the nature of the types of coverage the agency is receiving in the press.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through the July 2005 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-04.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 511210 with a small business size standard of $21.0 million.  This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  

It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure Luna Imaging’s Insight software from Luna Imaging, Inc., Los Angeles, CA, the system that best serves the needs of the National Library of Medicine (NLM)’s staff and patrons.  First of all, this is a premier image search and manipulation system, which meets the needs of  NLM’s image users.  What particularly recommends it to NLM, though, is the formal arrangement and product interoperability that Luna has established with Endeavor, which is the vendor for Voyager and ENCompass.  Voyager is a software product that runs the Library’s catalog of books, serials, and audiovisuals. ENCompass is a software product that provides a specialized means of access to multiple databases both within and outside the Library.  Using Luna Imaging’s Insight software to run the Library’s on-line image product “Images from the History of Medicine”, will allow it to take advantage of cataloging capabilities and authority controls of the Voyager system.  It will also make the images accessible through multi-database searches in NLM’s ENCompass system.  Exchanging data among these three systems maximizes the capabilities of each.  Thus, it is strongly in NLM’s interest to acquire the Luna Imaging’s software to add to its existing Voyager and ENCompass systems, rather than working with another vendor and having to perform extensive, expensive, and previously untested programming in order to match the characteristics of this system.  
In order for NLM to utilize this software effectively, NLM needs specialized services for configuration and installation of the Luna Imaging’s software, specialized training for its staff in the operation of the Luna software system, and ongoing maintenance and support of the Luna software system.  It is strongly in NLM’s interests to have Luna provides the specialized services, training, and maintenance and support, rather than have another company do these tasks.  Luna’s Insight software is solely supported by Luna Imaging, Inc.  There are no systems integrators qualified in, or even familiar with, the operating aspects of the software.  No other sources or combination of sources provides the features that Insight software offers.  Further awards to any other sources would result in both substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  The period of performance is anticipated for a period of twelve (12) months with options for four (4) successive one-year periods.  

The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the services as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information. Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H. Phuong, Contract Specialist, on (301) 496-6127.  Fax requests WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  Vendor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and Local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order.  Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR): htm://www.amet.gov/far/.  The following clauses and provisions shall apply to this acquisition and maybe obtained from the web sites: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items (March 2005); 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items (October 2003); and 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items (July 2005).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-05 and DFARs Change Notice (DCN) 20050726.  Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code is 7372, FSC Code is 7021 and the size standard is 1,000 employess.  NAICS is 334111.
This acquisition is for Brand Name items only and is a small business set-aside.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures (The award will be less than $100,000) will be followed.  This Brand Name purchase will be for a total of the following upgrade items for a single channel pC-Nova 3.0 Image Generator.  The required upgrade includes:  Two (2) additional channels, each configured for 1600 active pixels by 1200 active lines and 60 Hz update rate, with a single DVI-I video output per channel, one (1) spare node of each type (Pager and Standard), and cabling to accommodate a fully-expanded configuration of eight (8) channels.
Brand Name Justification Information:

1.  The 412 TW/EWOS has a requirement for a Brand Name purchase of Aechelon Technology equipment required to upgrade the existing single channel pC-Nova 3.0 Image Generator.   
2.  The required equipment upgrade from Aechelon Technology is needed to support the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Mission Systems Cockpit Implementation and Planning effort.  This effort is part of the Air Warfare Mission Simulator/Joint Strike Fighter/Test and Evaluation, Modeling and Simulation (AWMS/JSF/TEMS) effort currently under contract with Symvionics, Inc.  Currently, the Program Office has a single channel pC-Nova 3.0 Image Generator manufactured by Aechelon Technology.  In order for the required upgrades to be compatible with the existing Aechelon Technology pC-Nova Image Generator, the Program Office must use the same hardware as that currently in existence.  Changes in hardware configuration would result in extensive revalidation and re-verification of the configuration.   Market research conducted by the Program Office has shown that non Aechelon Technology equipment would not be compatible with the existing equipment.  Replacing all the current equipment would be cost prohibitive and negatively impact the mission.  Differences in configuration from the existing equipment could jeopardize the development and use of capabilities at Edwards AFB in support of the JSF Program, and the entire AWMS/JSF/TEMS effort.  The required equipment upgrade includes:  Two (2) additional channels, each configured for 1600 active pixels by 1200 active lines and 60 Hz update rate, with a single DVI-I video output per channel, one (1) spare node of each type (Pager and Standard), and cabling to accommodate a fully-expanded configuration of eight (8) channels.  The equipment is all commercial in nature and available to other business entities from Aechelon Technology.
3.  Aechelon Technology is the name brand currently utilized in this area of the JSF Program.  The equipment is proprietary to Aechelon Technology.  As a result, no other vendor’s products will meet the requirement for interfacing with the existing proprietary equipment.  Due to form, fit and function requirements, the required upgrades must be procured by Aechelon Technology.
 
Interested parties who believe they can meet all the requirements for the required Aechelon Technology upgrades described in this synopsis are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the required training requirement.  Offerors are required to submit with their quote enough information for the Government to evaluate the minimum requirements detailed in this synopsis.  CONTRACTORS MUST COMPLY WITH FAR 52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003) AND DFARS 252.204-7004, ALTERNATE A (NOV 2003).  INTERESTED CONTRACTORS CAN ACCESS THE CLAUSE BY INTERNET URL: http://farsite.hill.af.mil.  TO REGISTER WITH THE CCR, GO TO URL: https://www.ccr.dlsc.dla.mil/.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

Background

After three years of negotiations, Sudan’s government and main rebel group in Southern Sudan (Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army – SPLM/A) signed comprehensive peace accords on January 9, 2005 to end more than 21 years of civil war.  But as Khartoum makes peace on one front, another violent conflict persists in Western Sudan.

Open warfare erupted in Darfur in early 2003 when two loosely allied rebel groups, the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) attacked military installations.  The rebels, who seek an end to the region’s chronic economic and political marginalization, also took up arms to protect communities against the government-backed militias (“Jingaweit”) recruited among groups of Arabic extraction.  Militia attacks and a scorched-earth government offensive have led to looting, indiscriminate killings, and massive displacement.

The situation in Darfur is acknowledged to be a humanitarian crisis of the first order.  According to the UN’s Humanitarian Profile (# 9 – dated Dec. 1, 2004) an estimated 2.39 million people are displaced out of a population of 6.5 million within Darfur, and more than 200,000 have crossed the border into neighboring Chad.

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is heavily engaged in addressing this ongoing humanitarian crisis.  In FY 2004, USAID provided more than $186 million in support of humanitarian programs in Darfur, Sudan.

Introduction

OFDA is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The Disaster Operations Specialist (DOS) plays a central role in the U.S. Government’s (USG) disaster response, humanitarian assistance, and disaster risk management programs.  DOS positions require general expertise in humanitarian assistance and disaster response operations, and incumbents are responsible for assisting in the development of response strategies, all aspects of grant management for humanitarian donor organizations, and in the preparation of talking points, information products, and briefing materials.  The DOS works as a member of a team consisting of other DOSs, a Regional Coordinator, Information Officers, and Technical Specialists.

The DOS will cover OFDA’s Darfur portfolio from within the DRM Division, as a member of a multi-person Enhanced Regional Team covering Sudan.  Under the management of the Regional Coordinator, the DOS will work with the other Enhanced Regional Team members to manage foreign disaster relief and mitigation programs.  The Darfur DOS will be assigned for a period of 11 months with the possibility of an extension.

OBJECTIVE

The incumbent will manage a portfolio of activities in the Darfur region of Sudan, working as part of a country-focused humanitarian response team to meet USG humanitarian assistance and disaster response objectives.

STATEMENT OF WORK

The incumbent will assist in responding to the humanitarian emergency in Darfur.  The incumbent will manage all aspects of the disaster response and disaster risk management program, including coordinating reviews and analyses of grant proposals, preparation of documentation to expedite grant project approval, and evaluation and monitoring of grant activities, both from Washington and in Sudan.  The incumbent is expected to travel, as needed, to Darfur to assess the situation and monitor grant activity.  S/he is also responsible for deploying on short notice to serve on DARTs and Washington based RMTs, as required by OFDA.

Grant Portfolio Management:
The incumbent will assume primary responsibility for the management of selected OFDA-funded programs in Darfur, Sudan.  In coordination with Regional Team and Technical Assistance Group (TAG) members, s/he will:

• Coordinate with the Darfur DART or other in-country OFDA entity to identify potential areas of focus for USAID relief projects and, with DART input, recommend relief activity areas that need to be addressed and solicit new project proposals for these areas as required;

• Interface with implementing organizations regarding project proposals submitted for OFDA funding to ensure proposals provide information required by OFDA's Grant Guidelines and to discuss the appropriateness to OFDA program objectives and budget line items; 

• Coordinate reviews of proposals for relief programs, including developing issues papers, preparing and distributing briefing packets for all invitees, determining the need for follow-up meetings, reporting on the outcome of the proposal review to USG personnel in the field, and drafting official correspondence to Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), International Organizations (IOs) and United Nations (UN) agencies;

• Prepare all documentation to expedite grant project approval, including inputting data into the New Management System (NMS) for transmittal to the USAID Office of Acquisition and Assistance (OAA); 

• Track program reports from grantees and ensure reports are received in a timely manner, read program reports to ensure that program objectives have been achieved, collate input from reports for feedback to grantees, and share reports with Regional Team members, as appropriate; 

• Expedite the flow of programmatic and other documents through the clearance process; 

• Provide support to OFDA field assessments of USG-funded projects;

• Provide updates through oral and written reports, talking points, and other briefing materials on issues related to the humanitarian situation in Darfur, Sudan;

Disaster Response and Mitigation: 
The incumbent will assume responsibility to monitor threatening and incipient disasters and reviewing, coordinating, administering, and implementing emergency relief and rehabilitation programs in Darfur, consistent with OFDA's country strategy.  In coordination with Regional Team and TAG members, s/he will:

POSITION DESCRIPTION
Background

The core functions of the Resources Team are management of contracts for program-funded personnel, procurement, procurement planning, and policy review and guidance.  The Program Operations Specialist (POS) works closely with the Resources Team Leader to carry out these functions.  The Program Operations Specialist requires experience working in government, an international organization, or a business setting, with responsibilities related to procurement, human resources, or other administrative services.

Introduction

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.

<DESC>This is amendment 0002.  Questions and answers could not be attached through Fedbizopps so they are provided herein as follow:

Q 1.) Are the items outlined in “Section III Tasks” minimum mandatory requirements, or would FEMA entertain a response from a contractor that was comprehensive, providing for 5 day, once a day news summariy coverage, yet not provide for 7 day coverage of news summaries?

A.1.) The tasks listed are minimum mandatory requirements.  While under typical operations , we only require five day (M-F) support, during periods of heightened disaster activity when our operations are functioning 24/7, the summaries must follow suit and expand to 7 days.  Its not a problem to deliver to one point of contact at FEMA, who would then deliver to the designated distribution list of FEMA officials.

Q.2.) How important is timeliness versus other requirements?

A.2.) We monitor wires for breaking news internally. Our primary requirement with this contract is to meet the need to provide daily summaries of media coverage to FEMA leadership.

Q.3.)  What are FEMA’s media priorities in terms of sources? (i.e. Can you provide a list of the major sources by media types that are “must haves”?)

A.3.) As part of the best value determination, we will look at the depth of sources that a contractor accesses.  We would like as much coverage as possible, bearing in mind that other considerations as well.  In brief, however, our media priorities in terms of sources would be a national print (both newspaper and magazines), broadcast and online media as well as local and regional print, as available, broadcast and online.

Q.4.)  How many FEMA employees would need access to the news summaries, full text of the articles contained in the new summaries and e-mail alerts, etc? How many outside of FEMA could potentially require these services?

A.4.) The news summaries, including full text of articles, are distributed daily to 165 FEMA employees.  We don’t currently use e-mail alerts, but would likely distribute to a similar number of employees, depending on the level of interest. We don’t currently distribute our news summaries/clips outside of FEMA>

Q.5.) Does FEMA currently have all of the capabilities as defined in the RFP for Media Clipping Services?

A.5.) We do not currently have the weekly summaries as described in part of task#3 (we do have the archive in that task, however,)
Q.6.) If so, Is it performed  by FEMA employees or is there currently a contractor that performs these services for FEMA?

A.6.) A contractor is in place.

Q.7.) How does FEMA intend to address copyright issues?

A.7.)  That would be worked out by the Contractor.

Q.8.) Is there a bidders list? If so, can it be made available to other interested parties?

A.8.) No, the RFP is on FEBIZOPP’s.

Q9.) What is the budget for this initiative?

A.9.) Approximately $225,000.00 annually

Q.10.) In order to propose do we have to meet 100% of the requirements?

A.10.) The only task we would consider foregoing are the weekly summaries.  All other tasks and the full deliverable as described must be met to be considered.

Q.11.) Who is the Technical Lead?

A.11.) Kathryn Cable

Q.12.) Would you consider extending the deadline for two weeks?

A.12.) No

Q 13.) How many copies of our submission do you prefer?

A.13.) Four

Q.14.) The process requires the collecting of news stories and anticipated coverage from “major print, broadcast and web media” Do you have a defined list of preferred outlets?

A.14.) No

Q.15.) Is it relevant that our company is on the opposite coast?

A.15.) No.

Q.16.) Is there an incumbent?

A.16.) Yes, Bulletin News of McLean, Virginia.
Q.17.) Where will the work be performed, Contractor or Government Site?

A.17.) Contractor’s site.
