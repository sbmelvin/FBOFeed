<DESC>The Samuel S. Stratton VA Medical Center (hereafter "The VA" or "VA"), located at 113 Holland Avenue, Albany NY, 12208, has a requirement for a New Emergency Department.  The work includes but is not limited to the following:
The project includes design and construction period services for the creation of an approximately 28,200 square foot addition to the Main Hospital building at the Stratton VA Medical Center.  This addition primarily is for an approximately 10,400 square foot new Emergency Department at grade on the end of the hospital's B-wing. The remaining area is intended as a new connector to the main hospital's building core, shell space for later offices and a shelled basement underneath all grade-level additions. 
The new addition will be designed structurally to accommodate future vertical expansion. Site work is included in this project to provide separate routing for ambulance arrivals and patient walk-ins.
An initial study of the project has already been completed under a separate contract. Preliminary space programming requirements have been detailed in that report. In addition to the basic Emergency Department rooms, a dedicated x-ray room and a pneumatic tube transport system will be included in this project.
The VA intends to release this as a competitive Invitation for Bids (IFB). The applicable NAICS code for this project is 236220, "COMMERCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION."  The estimated construction value of this project falls within the range of $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  
The VA is currently surveying the market via a Sources Sought notice to determine the bonding capacity of various socio-economic groups.  The response from the sources sought and other market research will determine the set aside category for this acquisition.  The set-aside will not be announced before the solicitation is published to FBO.  The solicitation is expected to be released during or about the week of May 14, 2012.  
Unless additional notice is given or this notice is modified, the full IFB will be posted to the Government-wide Point of Entry (www.fbo.gov).

This is a presolicitation notice synopsizing an upcoming competitive solicitation to satisfy the requirements of FAR 5.201 and 5.203.

<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Sciences, intends to award a sole source contract to Advanced Measurement Technology, Inc., (AMETEK) 801 South Illinois Avenue, Oak Ridge, TN 37831-9101 for the maintenance of AMETEK laboratory instruments.
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is 12 months, with four (4) twelve (12) months option period.<br /><br />AMETEK is a global manufacturer of electronic instruments and electromagnetic devices, of which many have been custom designed for the CDC's Inorganic and Radiation Analytical Toxicology Laboratory. Therefore, since AMETEK developed the software, hardware, and instrumentation packages for the laboratory instruments such as gamma and alpha spectrometers, the high-purity geranium gamma detectors, and the sodium iodide detectors purchased at NCEH/DLS, AMETEK has the unique perspective of not only being the manufacturer, but knows the product, as well as processes all the parts and information to repair the instrumentation. Accordingly, AMETEK possesses the patented technical data specific to the laboratory instrumentation currently being utilized. In addition, because the instrumentation and software purchased are proprietary, no other manufacturer can provide the required software function upgrades. Considering this information, there are currently no other vendors with the capability to repair these instruments or satisfy the program's requirements regarding such.</p>
<p>The instruments designed by AMETEK are highly complex with integrated computer operations and dedicated software. Therefore, their proper maintenance and repair requires a high degree of technical skills and long-term familiarity with the instruments. As previously mentioned, AMETEK is the manufacturer of the instruments requiring maintenance services and thus has all the parts, schematics, and other information to repair the system.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to AMETEK. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Richard Jenkins via email ONLY at rbj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2012-N-14302 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN April 20, 2012.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

Wells Branch Parkway, Pflugerville, TX 78660, for VMS Software License Fees; Mobile Vet Software Maintenance Fees; and Mobile Census Software Maintenance Fees. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.

No solicitation is being issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes/proposals, however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement which, if received by the response date, shall be considered by the Agency. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within discretion of the Government.

<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents the intent to modify services provided by CGS under contract number HHSM-500-2010-M0002Z authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals. <br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals.<br /><br />This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<DESC>This market survey is issued in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) paragraph 3.2.1.2.1, to obtain information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to conduct a full and open competition.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The STARS contract was awarded September 16, 1996, and ends September 30, 2012. The STARS contract was competitively awarded to replace the legacy Terminal Automation systems Automated Radar Terminal System (ARTS) and Common Automated Terminal Systems (CARTS) at all Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facilities.  STARS is currently operational nationwide at fifty-one (51) Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities and Air Traffic Control Towers, and seventy-two (72) Department of Defense (DoD) Radar Approach Control (RAPCON).  In December 2011, the FAA formally approved STARS to replace CARTS IIIE systems currently operational at eleven (11) major TRACONS.  This decision was identified as Terminal Automation Modernization Replacement Phase 3 Segment 1 and was publically announced in October 2010.   It is necessary for the FAA to award a contract through FY 2017 to maintain, technically refresh, and enhance all STARS in the National Airspace System (NAS).  At this point, the FAA knows of one company (the incumbent, Raytheon Company) that can meet these requirements.  The FAA anticipates the award of a contract for system maintenance, system technical refresh, and system enhancements through fiscal year 2017 for system maintenance, system technical refresh, and system enhancements.  
There are restrictive data rights to certain parts of the STARS software and the awardee must either have data use rights or have access to it in order to meet the requirements of this market survey.  Specifically, AutoTrac is software required to integrate radar and flight plan data and display accurate information to air traffic controllers for the Full Service Level for STARS.  TRACVIEW is software required integrate radar and flight plan data and display the accurate information to air traffic controllers for the Emergency Service Level for STARS.  ATCoach is a multi-purpose, real-time Air Traffic Control Simulator system from UFA that supports the generation of data needed to supply automation systems with surveillance, weather, and flight data for STARS training and test simulation. 
If any vendor believes they have the capability and/or data rights necessary to meet the FAA requirements for system maintenance, technical refresh, and system enhancements for the STARS, please submit a Capability Statement that clearly states how they will be able to meet these requirements to the STARS Contracting Officer, Peter DeWald at Peter.DeWald@FAA.Gov no later than fourteen (14) calendar days from issuance of this announcement.  Any such response must include details regarding your rights to AutoTrac, TRACVIEW, and ATCoach. 
This announcement is for notification purposes only and is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.

<DESC>Introduction
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) seeks a vendor to service the Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs) participating in a Regional Vendor Pilot (hereafter referred to as the Pilot or RVP), conducted as part of the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR). Specifically, the vendor would be required to accept orders for foods that comprise the FDPIR food package from participating ITOs; and deliver those foods to those organizations, in good condition, according to a negotiated schedule, and cost effectively. <br /><br />Background</p>
<p>FNS' mission is to reduce hunger and food insecurity, in partnership with cooperating organizations, by providing children and needy people access to food, a healthful diet, and nutrition education in a manner that supports American agriculture. FNS achieves this mission by administering USDA's 15 domestic nutrition assistance programs. <br /><br />Among those programs is FDPIR, which provides food to low income households living on Indian reservations and Native American families residing in designated areas near reservations. FDPIR was established as an alternative to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program) because such areas often do not have easy access to grocery stores. <br />Current FDPIR Operational Environment</p>
<p>Under FDPIR's current food distribution model, USDA buys food, which is sent to two USDA-contracted warehouses, both in Missouri. From there, food is distributed to ITOs and State agencies that administer FDPIR. This is known as the National Warehouse Model.</p>
<p>The National Warehouse Model is not ideal because it does not provide sufficient opportunities to incorporate local and traditional foods into the FDPIR food package and has high costs associated with the centralized storage and trans-national transportation of food.</p>
<p>Additionally, sites also receive fresh fruits and vegetables delivered by the Department of Defense. However, this Program will not be part of the Pilot and will continue as currently operated. <br /><br />Background and Goal of FDPIR Regional Vendor Pilot<br />FNS intends to pilot a Regional Distribution Model, starting in calendar year 2012. FNS will select a limited number of ITOs to participate in this Pilot, which will be "grouped" in one geographic area. There are several natural "Groupings" of ITOs throughout the nation.<br />Under the proposed Pilot, USDA would contract with a vendor, which would service the Grouping selected to participate in the Pilot. Specifically, the vendor would buy USDA-approved items and distribute them directly to the ITOs, which would then prepare and distribute FDPIR food packages to program participants. This would be known as the Regional Vendor Pilot (RVP), or the Pilot.</p>
<p>To be successful, the vendor selected for the Pilot must (at minimum) successfully and consistently (1) accept orders for foods that comprise the FDPIR food package from participating ITOs and Tribes, (2) deliver those foods to those organizations, (3) according to a negotiated schedule, (4) in good condition and (5) be cost-effective. <br /><br />Other anticipated benefits of the Pilot include (1) incorporation of traditional foods into the FDPIR food package, (2) greater opportunity to purchase foods from Native American producers, and (3) improved customer service for FDPIR organizations and program participants.</p>
<p>The Groupings Thirty-one (31) Tribes and/or ITOs expressed interest in participatin. Based on the geographic proximity of those Tribes/ITOs to each other, FNS has identified the following five probable Groupings:</p>
<p>&bull; Midwest Grouping (Grouping #1) is composed of ITOs in Nebraska, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. Approximately 5.1 million pounds of multi-food shipments are delivered on an annual basis. The food shipments for this Grouping would go to approximately 17 different locations.</p>
<p>&bull; Southwest Grouping (Grouping #2) is composed of ITOs in Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arizona. Approximately 6.7 million pounds of multi-food shipments are delivered on an annual basis. The food shipments for this Grouping would go to approximately 17 different locations.</p>
<p>&bull; Oklahoma Grouping (Grouping #3) is composed of ITOs in Oklahoma. Approximately 4.9 million pounds of multi-food shipments are delivered on an annual basis. The food shipments for this Grouping would go to approximately 7 different locations.</p>
<p>&bull; New Mexico/Arizona Grouping (Grouping #4) is composed of New Mexico and Arizona. Approximately 1.8 million pounds of multi-food shipments are delivered on an annual basis. The multi-food shipments for this Grouping would go to approximately 10 different locations.</p>
<p>&bull; Northwest Grouping (Grouping #5) is composed of ITOs in California, Oregon and Washington. Approximately 3.9 million pounds of multi-food shipments are delivered on an annual basis. The food shipments for this Grouping would go to approximately 8 different locations. <br /><br />Only one of the Groupings will be selected to participate in the Pilot.</p>

The Contractor will be given two hours after verbal notification to correct the unacceptable performance. If the Contractor disagrees with the complaint after investigation of the site and challenges the validity of the complaint, the Contractor will notify the COTR. The COTR will conduct determine the validity of the complaint. If the COTR determines the complaint as invalid, he will document the written complaint of the findings and notify the customer. The COTR will retain documentation for his/her files. If after investigation the COTR determines the complaint as valid, the COTR will inform the Contractor, and the Contractor will be given an additional hour to correct the defect. A defect will not be recorded if proper and timely correction of the unacceptable condition(s) is accomplished. 
Emergency or Special Microfiber Cleaning Products/Uniforms/Necessary Linens
Ordered services meet the requirements of the contract as appropriate.     Performance Threshold:    100% of the time.

<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 15, Contracting by Negotiation.&nbsp; The North American Industry Classification System Code is 811219 and the business size standard in $19.0M.</p>
<p>Award will be made in the aggregate. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve months.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this procurement.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all labor, material and equipment to provide preventive maintenance for the government-owned:</p>
<p>&bull; Perkin Elmer Opera 561 High-Throughput Microscopy System, equipped with an environmental control unit (ECU) and kinetics dispenser module (serial #: Opera5020);<br />&bull; Perkin Elmer Opera 561 HighThroughput Microscopy System (serial #: Opera5026);<br />&bull; Perkin Elmer Janus Automated Liquid Handler Workstation (NIH property ID# 01789486; serial #: DG03094847) equipped with MDT I30 Dispense Head (serial #: DG03094859), MDT I235 dispense head (serial #: DG04094946), and two PSS21 PlateStak units (serial #: DS03094857, and serial #: DS03094858).</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide: 1) three (3) preventive maintenance inspections per component during the contract period; 2) emergency repair services on an unlimited basis during the term of this contract; 3) software service in accordance with the manufacturer's latest established service procedures to include telephone access to technical support for use of program software and trouble shooting of the operating systems; and 3) all required replacement parts, with the exception of consumable parts to include batteries.

The systems also require scheduled preventative maintenance due to wear and tear on moving parts and optical systems. <br />Perkin Elmer is the only manufacturer of the scientific equipment to be serviced under this contract. The equipment is highly specialized and complicated, integrating many proprietary technologies. Perkin Elmer is the only provider of service by factory trained engineers, and the only provider of original grade replacement parts.

Therefore, PerkinElmer is uniquely qualified to provide maintenance on the aforementioned equipment.<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

<DESC>FY12 SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES (SOF) APRON & TAXIWAY, CANNON AIR FORCE BASE, CURRY COUNTY, NEW MEXICO.  The proposed procurement is an Unrestricted acquisition, and thus open to large and small businesses. NAICS is 237310/SIC 1611, with a size standard of $33,500,000.00.  The magnitude of construction for this project will be between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00.  Bonding will be required for this acquisition.  Offerors attention is directed to Section 00100 in the Solicitation for information regarding the tour of the site.  Plans will be issued on or about 23 April 2012, with proposals due on or about 23 May 2012.  Offerors are advised that this requirement may be delayed, cancelled, or revised at any time during the solicitation, or final award process, and is subject to the availability of funds.<br><br>Construction services to be performed under the firm, fixed price contract will consist of the construction of a C-130 Aircraft Parking Apron and Taxiway consisting of approximately 125,000 SY of 16.5 inch concrete pavement. The project will include, among other things, aircraft tie downs, aircraft grounding points, site drainage, associated taxiway access, shoulders, pavement markings and lighting. Work will be completed in accordance with specification section 32-13-11: Concrete pavement for Airfield and other heavy duty pavements and other relevant criteria. The project will also include demolition and infrastructure relocation. The infrastructure relocation is to critical base systems, such as a potable water system consisting of a new water supply well and water loop approximately 21,000 linear feet. A primary power ductbank approximately 10,000 linear feet, runway lighting controls, taxiway lighting and utilities. The project is split into 7 phases due to mission critical operations that will be ongoing during construction. One phase of the project requires closure of the major runway and completion of the work in a very constrained amount of time. There is a considerable amount of risk to operations of the base during this phase of work. The remainder of the project is highly complex due to coordination with up to five other concurrent paving operations, phasing requirements, and base operations requirements. The infrastructure relocation is to critical base systems, such as runway lighting controls and also will need to be completed under constrained time frames. Relocation of the potable water system will require scheduling of activities to avoid shutdown of water to operating base facilities. The project provides vitally needed aircraft parking in support of the mission at Cannon Air Force Base.    <br><br>THE PROJECT will be advertised as a Request for Proposal.  Competitive proposals will be evaluated based on the evaluation criteria set forth in the solicitation package.  Evaluation by the Government will result in selection of a firm that represents the best value to the Government.  Proposed procurement will result in a firm-fixed price contract.  Questions of a technical nature should be addressed to Ms. Teresa King at (505) 343-6264 or e-mail at:  teresa.king@usace.army.mil.  OFFERORS MUST BE REGISTERED with Central Contractor Registration (CCR), in order to receive a Government Contract award.  To register, the CCR Internet address is: http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Central Iowa Health Care System (VACIHCS) in Des Moines, Iowa, Medical Center intends to solicit proposals from contractors in the Des Moines, Iowa metropolitan area to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.  The VA anticipates issuing a solicitation for this requirement on or about April 16, 2012, with a closing date for proposals on or about May 16, 2012.

The solicitation will provide full information to contractors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments.

The goal of the HCHV program is to remove homeless Veterans from the street or habitation unfit for Veterans and place them in community-based, residential environments with sufficient therapeutic services to meet the needs of those Veterans. Through the HCHV program, VA provides case management services to Veterans and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental and rehabilitative services.

Initial contract awards are expected to be on or about June 1, 2012.  Contracts will have a base term of one year, with options for three additional one-year terms.  Exercising the options is solely at the discretion of the VA.

Registration is free and potential offerors are encouraged to visit that CCR website and register as soon as possible to avoid delays should they be selected for a contract award. Questions concerning this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist using the e-mail link provided.  If contractors wish to be considered for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) they must be registered and certified at www.vetbiz.gov prior to award.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis/Request for Information:<br /><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL/QUOTE.
<p>Wright-Patterson Air Force Base OH anticipates a competitive acquisition to provide the following items/services:</p>
<p>AFSAC/IARMG has a requirement to support and maintain the Egyptian Air Force's (EAF) Integrated Logistics System (ILS) to include software, database, communications, and infrastructure. The contractor will support AFSAC/IARMG in procuring fiber optic cabling, providing cable installation services, and check-out to ensure that data traffic is interoperable with exiting microwave connections at multiple EAF ILS bases throughout Egypt. The contractor shall procure fiber cabling, connecting materials, and auxiliary infrastructure materials necessary for the complete installation of a fully functioning fiber network. The contractor shall inlay fiber cabling through ground trenching and install precast manholes. The contractor shall terminate the fiber optic cabling and perform check-out services to ensure that data traffic routes between the existing microwave tower and communication boxes. Material purchasing, installation, and check-out will occur at multiple EAF ILS bases throughout Egypt to include Beni Suef, Abu Suer, Belbeis, Cairo East, and Mansoura.</p>
<p><br />Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Firms responding should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 238210 size standard of $14,000,000. Please indicate revenue relative to the standard of $14,000,000. All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be awarded a DOD contract. No set-aside decision has been made.

SCOPE OF WORK
A.       INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

This statement of work will be issued under contract "Parking Garage", Project
No. 503-311.
1.   Background

With the Medical Center adding additional new building construction and experiencing increased outpatient specialty clinic activity, parking availability
adequate to support daily operations has reached a significant shortage.  Such
shortage is creating an atmosphere where patients are electing to skip their appointments and physicians are electing to skip routine meetings and other non clinic related activities.

The Medical Center created a temporary solution to expand existing parking into the grass areas and through new construction of surface parking.  This still does not allow the center to meet the patient, student, visitor and staff parking requirements created by the lack of adequate mass transit support to or near the Medical Center.  The inability to meet this parking demand increases patient complaints, decreases patient satisfaction with care, decreases timely staff movement about the campus and decreases the patients adequate access to care.

2.   Scope of Work

The A/E will furnish design services, technical specifications, working drawings, cost estimates, as-built drawings, construction period services, fire reviews, energy reviews and site visits for Project No. 503-311, "Parking Garage".

The project will provide for a pre-cast five level 200'x 200'parking garage with approximately 154,700 square foot (sf) total, to accommodate 449 stalls with an elevator.  The top level of the structure will partially be used as a platform for mounting solar panels.  The solar panels mounted on the fifth level will help meet the Federal Energy guidelines for renewable energy and reduced energy consumption.

3.   Objectives

Phase 1:    A/E will provide a design that will demolish and remove the existing parking area located at the Southwestern part of the employee parking lot.  The design will include the survey and establishment of control points, elevations, and topographical information required to complete the design of the parking structure and associated stormwater controls necessary to develop the site.  The survey will also locate existing above and below ground utilities located within the construction site.

Phase 2:    A/E will provide a design to construct a five level, precast parking garage that will accommodate 449 standard parking stalls.  The garage will include electrical lights, a utility/storage room area, stairs, elevators, an architectural finish, place for solar panels to be mounted, foundation, retaining wall system for construction if required, sprinkler system if required, It will meet all NEPA requirements concerning noise and pollution.  It will also meet the most current design codes.

Phase 3:  A/E will provide a design that will include site layout, stormwater
control, pedestrian and vehicular traffic and environmental impacts that are required to be completed to meet the VA design requirements.

Phase 4:    A/E will have obtained all permits required to begin construction
prior to submitting the finals bid documents.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) forEnterprise Solutions for Storage Virtualization
This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR REIMBURSE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS RFI.This RFI is being used to gather market research to make decisions regarding the development of acquisition strategies.  The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), in support of the United States Army Product Director Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology Enterprise Systems and Services (PD ALTESS), seeks information on a total solution for Storage Virtualization
Background:Italicized terms are defined by the Storage Networking Industry Association dictionary version v.2011.2.ENG.ALTESS provides full life-cycle information technology solutions, support and services to the Acquisition community and hosted customers in a secure environment.
ALTESS is performing market research for a product that provides storage virtualization capability.  This capability would help ALTESS to better manage the life cycles of its storage subsystems, to decrease storage subsystem brand dependency, and to meet requirements related to the Army Data Center Consolidation Plan.
The shared ALTESS infrastructure includes approximately 674 TB of formatted capacity provided by multiple storage subsystems.  These storage subsystems are utilized by several dozen Department of Defense (DoD) and US Army organizations.  While the anticipated growth of formatted capacity is expected to be subjectively high, external factors, including political factors, make it infeasible to determine a growth rate estimate with any confidence.  For historical context, the shared ALTESS infrastructures formatted capacity has increased over 800% in the last four years.  As reported for the last seven days at the time of this writing by OnCommand Insight 6.3, the total top internal volume IOPS for storage subsystems that comprise shared ALTESS infrastructure is 43,342 IO/second and the total top internal volume throughput for the same storage subsystems is 981 megabytes per second. In addition to this shared capacity, ALTESS also manages several storage subsystems that are dedicated to a few specific DoD and US Army organizations.
NAICS Code 541512 (Computer Systems Design Services) with a size standard of $25.5M applies to this Request for Information.  
Requested Information:1.	 Responses should address a total solution for Storage Virtualization that meet the following attributes:	Product shall have the capability to communicate with storage subsystems and host computers via both a fibre channel SAN at 8 gigabits per second and iSCSI over Ethernet at 10 gigabits per second.	Product shall be able to perform the migration of data between attached storage subsystems while not disrupting access to the data by the host environment actively using products storage virtualization capability.	Product shall have failure tolerance for all components.  Product shall have hot swap capability for all product components.  Products capabilities shall not be disrupted by the upgrade, downgrade, and/or replacement of products hardware and/or software.	Product shall have a multi-path I/O capability that supports asymmetric logical unit access.	Product shall have features that provide data preservation, data protection, thin provisioning, and data replication.	Product shall have a function that easily allows users to remove all host environment dependencies upon products storage virtualization capability.  The function will result in the data previously managed by products storage virtualization capability becoming usable by the host environment by accessing the attached storage subsystems without the need for product.	Product shall support at least 500 host computers simultaneously connected via fibre channel and iSCSI.  Product shall support at least 50 storage subsystems simultaneously connected via fibre channel and iSCSI.  Product must provide storage virtualization for at least 5 petabytes of raw capacity provided as LUNs by the connected storage subsystems.	Product shall have the capability to apply mirroring to the LUNs provided by connected storage subsystems to help protect data.  The mirroring capability must be able to utilize LUNs provided by storage subsystems of differing manufacturers.	Product shall provide reports on the total storage capacity, used storage capacity, and available storage capacity of the storage capacity being managed by products storage virtualization capability.	All product capabilities shall interoperate with at least with NetApp FAS, Hitachi USP-V, Hitachi AMS2000, and IBM DS8000 storage subsystems.  This interoperability shall be supported by products manufacturer and the manufacturers of the specified storage subsystems	All product capabilities shall interoperate with host computers running the operating systems Solaris, Windows, VMware ESX, VMWare ESXi, and Red Hat Linux.  This interoperability shall be supported by products manufacturer and the manufacturers of the specified host computer operating systems.	All product capabilities shall interoperate with Brocade DCX and Brocade DCX-4S fibre channel switches configured as a SAN.  This interoperability shall be supported by products manufacturer and Brocade.	Product shall comply with all US Army, Department of Defense and US federal government regulatory, policy, and technical requirements that are relevant to product.	Product shall be produced by a single manufacturer, and shall not be a combination of items produced by multiple manufacturers.	Products manufacturer shall offer on-site technical support services for product.  On-site support personnel shall arrive within four hours of being dispatched.	Products manufacturer shall offer telephone and e-mail based technical support services for product at all times.	Products manufacturer shall offer installation services for product.

<DESC>PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT
<p>CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT / GENERAL CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS SOUGHT<br />Reference No. 993</p>
<p><br />The University of California, Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (hereinafter called The University), which is operated under Prime Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), intends to solicit competitive proposals from prequalified sources for a two-phase Construction Management/General Contractor (CM/GC) Lump Sum subcontract for preconstruction services and construction for the Building 84 Center for Isotope Geochemistry Renovation (B84 CIG) Project at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotation. It is an announcement of subcontracting opportunities with the University of California, Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Interested firms are encouraged to submit a prequalification package as indicated below.</p>
<p>The Building 84 Center for Isotope Geochemistry Renovation (B84 CIG) Project, a fast track design project, consists of the renovation of approximately 5,750 sf of existing labs on the second and third floors of Building 84 into two Class 1,000 clean labs, a Class 10,000 clean lab for mass spectrometry and several general purpose labs.</p>
<p>Minimum requirements for CM/GCs wishing to submit their prequalification documents are:<br />1) Prospective CM/GC is required to have the following California contractor's license/classification: B GENERAL BUILDING CONTRACTOR.<br />2) Prospective CM/GC must have completed, as a general contractor, a minimum of 3 projects in the last 5 years, with a construction cost of more than $3 million each that are similar in scope and complexity to the project described herein.</p>
<p>Desired attribute:  Prospective CM/GC has maintained an average Workman's Compensation Experience Modification Rate (EMR) of 1.0 or less over the last 3 years.</p>
<p>GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF WORK</p>
<p>The B84 CIG project includes the following renovation work on the approximately 20 year old building:  selective demolition of interior finishes, lab equipment, walls and utilities to suit new layout; construction of new clean rooms, general chemistry labs and mass spectrometer labs, including but not limited to temporary measures to serve existing occupants,  structural modifications, casework, finishes, plumbing modifications, fire sprinkler upgrades (fire sprinklers will be design/build by GC), mechanical upgrades, mechanical controls, energy management controls, lighting, electrical upgrades, tel/data modifications, life safety modifications, commissioning assistance, possible hazardous gas controls, and other upgrades that may be required to serve new labs and clean rooms. Additionally, the mechanical controls for the entire building may be upgraded during this project if the budget allows.</p>
<p>The building will be partially occupied during the construction. The work is also adjacent to main pedestrian walkways and other occupied structures. LBNL has very high standards for construction safety and will vigorously enforce all safety regulations. Therefore, contractors must have a proven record of safe performance on past construction projects.</p>
<p>Estimated Price Range:  The current estimated construction cost range is $4.1 to $4.9 million.</p>
<p>CM/GC SERVICES</p>
<p>The University desires to award a two-phase Subcontract. During Phase 1, the CM/GC will perform "design-assist" preconstruction services, which shall include, but not be limited to, all preconstruction services normally provided by Construction Management firms, such as  equipment recommendations, constructability and drawing completeness reviews, utility coordination reviews, site investigations, cost estimates, attendance at weekly meetings, design evaluation and proposed design alternatives, value engineering suggestions if required for possible future implementation, etc. Within two weeks of the architect/engineer's completion of 50, 95, and 100 percent design documents the CM/GC shall submit an independent written Project Construction Cost Estimate and a comprehensive Critical Path Method (CPM) schedule, showing all project related construction activities. The CM/GC work shall also include the preparation of subcontract packages and the conduct of competitive bidding for lower-tier subcontracted work.</p>
<p>If the University exercises an option for performance of Phase 2, the Subcontractor shall provide general building contractor services to construct the project, including, but not limited to, providing specified general condition items, safety management, subcontractor management, quality control, submittal and RFI processes, document control and change order management.</p>
<p>PREQUALIFICATION PROCESS</p>
<p>The University has determined that CM/GCs must be prequalified to submit a proposal for this project.<br />Prequalification will be determined by means of a written questionnaire, which all interested CM/GCs must complete accurately and submit for evaluation by the University, to establish the CM/GC's prequalification status. The University will establish a short list of firms determined to be most qualified to perform the project successfully. Prequalified firms will be invited to submit a comprehensive proposal to include both price and technical evaluation factors. A single firm will be selected for award, based on a best value evaluation of proposals received.</p>
<p>Prequalification documents consisting of this NOTICE TO CM/GCs FOR PREQUALIFICATION together with the PREQUALIFICATION QUESTIONNAIRE will be available to intending CM/GCs beginning on April 3, 2012 at the following web site:  http://facilitiesprojects.lbl.gov/, under Reference No. 993. Submissions must be received by April 19, 2012, at 5:00 PM PDT.</p>
<p>Direct questions, comments and requests for clarification of the Prequalification Documents to Marguerite Fernandes via e-mail address:  mafernandes@lbl.gov, (Phone no.: 510.486.5158; office address: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, One Cyclotron Rd., Mail-Stop 76R0225, Berkeley, CA 94720)</p>

<p>Control Unit part #721004<br />Data collection module part #721001<br />Current Transducer part #501001<br />Temperature transducer part #501002<br />Fiber (60ft) part # 116002<br />Fiber boots part #108002<br />485 Communications cable part #116003</p>
<p>Currently the National Weather Service Central Region Headquarters has Cellwatch battery monitoring equipment. The Cellwatch parts requested in the requisition is for an expansion of the current Cellwatch system. <br />Continuing with Cellwatch is the most cost effective method. To add a different monitoring system would require a complete install and replacement of all. CR currently has 42 units in use at this time and all would have to be changed out to keep monitoring continuity as other systems are not compatible with each other. Estimation would be over $1M to switch brands. Cellwatch has already been approved and configured with IT to operate the NWS networks.</p>
<p>This is a small business set-aside. The NAICS code for this action is 423430. Size standard not to exceed 100 Employees. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to award a delivery order under the Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N61340-12-G-0001 to L-3 Communications Corporation, Link Simulation & Training Division (L-3) Company for the procurement of high definition (HD) visual systems for twenty-three F/A-18 and EA-18G Tactical Operational Flight Trainers (TOFTs) and the installation of two Government-owned E/F TOFTs at Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Japan.  The TOFT HD visual systems will be provided as 32 modification kits to the existing visual system and 14 new visual systems built to the same specification as the modified system.
  This HD visual system has already been installed on F/A-18 US Navy TOFTs.  As the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the F/A-18 and EA-18G TOFT visual system and as the only company to deliver current US Navy F/A-18C/D/E/F and EA-18G TOFTs, L-3 is the only source capable of providing HD visuals systems and delivering TOFTs.  Award to any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that would not be recovered through competition and would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling F/A-18 and EA-18G mission training requirements.  This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. (c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).
 No solicitation documents are available. This notice of intent is neither a request for competitive proposals nor a solicitation of offers. Matters pertaining to this notification may be directed to Cynthia Armound at 407-380-8460 or via email at cynthia.armound@navy.mil

  The Marine Corps ultimately intends to vehicle mount integrated kinetic and non-kinetic weapons to provide continuous OTM low altitude air defense of the MAGTF. GBAD DE OTM will demonstrate an Enabling Capability of laser engagement of close-in, low altitude threats in defense of the MAGTF.

This RFI is seeking responses that provide a GBAD OTM Joint Engagement Sequence (JES) consisting of OTM command and control (C2), sensor, communications and high energy laser (HEL) weapon to provide continuous low altitude air defense.  The JES consists of six air defense steps that must occur to successfully engage a target:  1) Surveil; 2) Detect; 3) Track/identification; 4) Threat evaluation and weapons assignment (TEWA) and Alert; 5) Act; and 6) Assess.
 During the execution of the air defense kill chain the integrity of each individual link is vital to the success of the whole chain. The GBAD OTM FNC focuses on three components: a target detection sensor, such as surrogate radar, a C2 system and a weapon system.  The weapon system may include a gun, missile system, which complements the high energy laser (HEL).  For the purposes of this RFI, the only weapon of interest is the HEL.   Targets are detected and tracked using radar or other volume search sensor, target information (e.g. location and track covariance) is passed to the C2 system for evaluation and a potential decision to engage.  The C2 system communicates the target location as well as any command to fire to the weapon system.
  The weapon system performs local track using Electro-Optical (EO) and/or Infrared (IR) imagers, engages the target and assesses the damage.  For the purposes of this RFI, the OTM surveillance sensor, C2, and weapon system may be located in separate areas or vehicles.

It is critical to clarify the dependencies of the other kill chain links within the context of GBAD OTM JES. The ground based OTM sensor provides full fire control quality solutions for the GBAD HEL weapon.  The sensor monitors the low to medium altitude three-dimensional volume of airspace.  Surveillance enables the GBAD C2 OTM operator to assign air threats to the GBAD HEL weapon for engagement before the air threat can effectively threaten a friendly asset.
  The sensor contributes to building a coherent common tactical air picture with sufficient fidelity to detect and display the location of friendly, enemy and neutral air tracks.  Evaluation of the engagement is envisioned to be conducted by high resolution EO and/or IR system mounted on the weapon vehicle.  

To support this program, NSWCDD is seeking information on portable OTM systems, mature concepts, and technologies that support this mission.  GBAD OTM must be able to interface and access the common tactical picture in real time via a wireless C2 system.  The platform is envisioned to be a light tactical military vehicle that can carry a HEL-based weapon which can acquire and track targets OTM, and engage targets OTM or at the pause.
  The system must be able to operate in light or darkness and in good or bad weather conditions.  The system will utilize open architecture to the extent practical.

Information is requested on system/subsystem components, including:

1.	Target acquisition sensor.  Information is requested on vehicular/portable systems, concepts, and technologies for target acquisition sensors. The role of this sensor system is to provide track data for acquisition of threats by the sensor package on the weapons platform. The system should provide three-dimensional target tracks to ensure proper transformation into the local coordinate frame of the beam director, as well as have an inertial navigation system capable of sensing position and attitude of the system.
 It must be able to detect and track high or low altitude threats and other short range air defense targets at ranges which limit the ability of the target to perform detection, identification or recognition of friendly assets.  The system must be lightweight, resilient, electronic-warfare resistant, and can reliably search, detect, track, record, and communicate target data before, during and after the weapon engagement in support of initial targeting, aim-point updates, and battle-damage/kill-assessment.  Accuracy of the track must be sufficient for pointing of the HEL weapon system.  It should be small, efficient, and reliable.

2.	Command and Control.  Information is also requested on vehicular-mounted systems, concepts, and technologies for C2.
  It must be secure, resilient (e.g. self-forming and self-healing), electronic-warfare resistant against typical ground and air-based threats, and  can reliably pass track information to support engagement, system states, videos, still images, commands, and other information between the GBAD components.  It should be a non-deterministic, multi-node capable system which is small, efficient, reliable, low-latency and operates at tactically significant ranges in good or bad weather, and must not cause Electro-magnetic interference to other components in the system.

3.	Overall system control.  It is desired that installation of the integrated subsystems will result in a compact demonstrator that will require overall system/subsystem control with system operation parameters being logged, automatic or man-in-the-loop acquisition, keep-out zones, no-fire zones/spots and predictive avoidance functions.
  This software will control and monitor all subsystems of the demonstrator and support manual control, decision-based control, and a pathway to autonomous control. 

4.	Laser subsystem.  The laser subsystem is expected to be a modular packaging design that lends itself to scaling to significantly higher output powers.  Specific attention to overall system efficiency and size/weight must be noted.  Key attributes include high laser efficiency (desired to be approximately 35% electrical to optical efficiency), high specific power (approximately 150 W/kg), high power to volume ratio (approximately 80 kW/m3) and ruggedization for suitable use in a ground vehicle off-road environment (maximum profile at installation interface is approximately -3.8 g to 4 g with peaks centering around 1.5 to 10 Hz for severe courses, but it is envisioned that semi-active or fully active suspension will dampen some of the motion).
   

5.	Beam Director/Beam Control subsystem.  The desired area of coverage of the beam director is 360o in azimuth.  The elevation angles of coverage must be sufficient to engage the targets of interest. Light weight designs without central obscuration of the laser are desired along with traditional Cassegrain approaches.  The beam control system includes the following subsystems: inertial sensors, EO/IR sensors, optics, optical bench(es), control software, interfaces, controllers and image processors. While there is interest in complete beam control systems that include all the aforementioned elements, specific and highly relevant component technologies are also sought that would increase performance in the areas of inertial sensing and aimpoint maintenance.
 It is desirable that the beam director and beam control system be capable of residual line of sight pointing error that is a fraction of the diffraction limited performance of the tracking sensors.

6.	Thermal Management subsystem.  The thermal management subsystem (TMS) must maintain the temperature of laser weapon system within its operating temperature range and absorb heat generated by the laser system during engagements.  The operating temperature range of the weapon system will be specific to the selected system design.  Heating/cooling required to maintain the system within acceptable limits depend on the system packaging and the outdoor environment (temperature, pressure, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar loading).
  Please refer to the sections on Packaging and Environment for more details.  The heat generated by the laser system includes heat from the laser, power subsystem, and losses in the beam transfer system.  Combinations of spray cooling, recirculators, phase-change materials, thermal reservoirs, and refrigeration units may be considered.  Refrigeration units must be able to dissipate the heat to the outdoor environment.  Please refer to the section on the Environment for more details.  Size, weight and power trades are important in the thermal management subsystem design, and should be commensurate with the weapons vehicle platform.

7.	Prime Power. The prime power system must meet the total power requirements of the laser weapon system, including the powering the laser, thermal management subsystem, beam director/beam-control subsystem, target acquisition sensor, battle damage assessment sensor, and command and control system.
  Powering the laser and thermal management impose peak demands on the electrical power system.  The other system components (target acquisition sensor, battle damage sensor, C2 system) will have steady-state power requirements.  A combination of batteries, ultra-capacitors and on-platform generation may be considered for meeting the steady-state and peak demands.  Engine-generator sets, if used in the prime power system, must be capable of running on both diesel and JP-8 fuel. The steady state and peak power requirement must be available even after derating for JP-8 fuel, and at the worst case operating conditions of temperature and altitude described in Section 10 (Environment). The prime power subsystem shall meet the military ground platform requirements of MIL-STD-461 for conducted emissions (CE), radiated radio frequency (RF) emissions, and susceptibility.
 All power interfaces with the 28VDC electrical system of the host vehicle platform shall meet MIL-STD-1275D. On-the-move electric power delivery capability is required from the prime power system, and it shall meet the ground transportation shock and vibration requirements of MIL-STD-810F.  Size and weight should be commensurate with the weapons vehicle platform.

8.	Damage Assessment.  Also requested is information on vehicular-mounted systems, concepts, and technologies that can provide an assessment of the damage/disruption to a target at the engagement ranges.

9.	Packaging.  The Demonstrator may be integrated as a self-contained palletized unit that will be mounted on the bed of a tactical vehicle, such as a variant of the JLTV or similar.
  Refrigeration units may be mounted separately from the weapon system package.

The objective system will be integrated with a tactical vehicle to be selected at a later date.
 
10.	Environment.  The Demonstrator will be expected to operate in the following environment: 
	Temperature, - 46C to +71 C; 
	Altitude Operations, up to 10,000ft MSL; 
	Relative humidity, 10% to 99%; 
	Solar loading, 0 to 1100 W/m-2; 
	Wind, 0 to 80 kts; 
	Salt fog,  IAW MIL-STD-810G; 
	Blowing sand, 2.2p/m3 +/- 0.5g/m3, sized 150-850m at 18-29 m/s
	Fine sand/dust, 10g/m3 +/- 7g/m3, sized up to 150 m at 1.5 to 8.9 m/s
	Rainfall, up to 4.0in/hr
	Ice Glaze, up to 19mm coating 
	Shock/vibration/acoustic noise profile, TBD based upon vehicle;
	Ability to withstand and be decontaminated in a CBRN environment IAW MIL-STD-7179

In addition, the Demonstrator is expected to survive (stored mode) with the additional requirements of the following:  
	Wind,  to 120 kts while in helicopter transport; 
	Altitude storage, up to 1,000ft below MSL;
	Salt Spray, 5% salt atmosphere;
	Long-term storage, minimum 7 months shipboard storage.

The objective system will be specified in JCIDS documents, to be issued at a later date.

The Veterans Integrated Service Network 18 (VISN 18) includes 7 health care facilities.  The seven health care faculties are the:  Northern Arizona VA Health Care System in Prescott, AZ, Phoenix VA Health Care System in Phoenix, AZ, Southern Arizona VA Health Care System in Tucson, AZ, New Mexico VA Health Care System in Albuquerque, NM, El Paso VA Health Care System in El Paso, TX, Amarillo VA Health Care Facility, in Amarillo, TX and the West Texas VA Health Care System located in Big Spring Texas.  VISN 18 requires a qualified Contractor to provide an educational program that will address both the foundational instruction and the career development needs of facility employees in grades GS-01 thru GS-05 and Wage Grade equivalents.  The program will be a packaged system that will be administered by a VISN 18 employee and will require minimal training for the administrator. The Contractor must be able to provide a commercial off-the-shelf product which does not require tailoring or any preparatory input from the VISN18 Staff.

The program will enhance upward mobility opportunities for employees in grades GS 1-5 and Wage Grade equivalents. It will also prepare employees for effective competition in other leadership programs within VA, will encompass a proactive EEO approach, and will prepare participants to enroll in certificate and degree programs available at local educational institutions. These benefits will also improve the participants' job performance, boost employee morale, improve retention, and help the facility institute a Career Ladder System.

Employees in entry-level positions need to develop computer and organizational skills, as well as improving or establishing abilities in math, reading, grammar, and writing. Additional provision must be given to training in medical terminology and medical ethics. The curriculum must accommodate persons who require remedial training in basic subject matter in addition to providing instruction in core health care topics. Both the employee/students and the administrator/faculty personnel will participate in the instructional environment (classroom) during regular working hours. Any program offered for consideration will have pre-determined goals with established time constraints of up to six-month periods for each level or subject. 

The contractor will provide all tools and materials (including text/work books needed) to be used in a system that will be administered by a member of the VA Education Service staff. This staff member will serve as a project manager: overseeing classroom activities, providing mentoring, keeping attendance, monitoring the students' progress, and administering examinations. The project manager will require access to Contractor personnel via email and/or telephone to address any issues that may come up and answer any questions about the Contractor's program or its procedures. The contractor is responsible for maintaining any off-site, online portion of any package

The Industry Day will be held virtually using the web-based conferencing tool called Defense Connect Online (https://www.dco.dod.mil/) from 1000 to 1130 EST.  The focus of this event is to provide an overview of the PM SMS organization and products and an update on the latest PM SMS planning regarding the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle (ENVG) and Family of Weapon Sight (FWS) programs.  The DCO website utilizes a voice-over-internet (voip) protocol so all participants will be able to hear the briefing and see the presentation material as it is being presented.  A question and answer tool will allow participants to submit questions throughout the briefing and during a designated Q&A period at the end of the event.  Questions may also be provided prior to the conference by email to the PM SMS Technical Point of Contacts (POCs) listed below.    <br>Attendance is limited to U.S. Department of Defense personnel and U.S. Department of Defense contractors, and exceptions as approved by PM SMS.  Those companies interested in attending the conference should submit an "Attend PM SMS Industry Day Conference" email to the Administrative POC not later than 23 April 2012.  Because this event will be held virtually, there is no limit to the number of attendees.  If your organization intends to establish a conference room connection supporting multiple employees, please provide a primary point of contact and a list of the secondary points of contact that are expecting to participate in the event.  If you are not a U.S. Department of Defense or U.S. Department of Defense contractor, indicate that you are requesting an exception to the attendance criteria.

<DESC><p>The Government intends to solicit and award a sole source 8(a) contract to Creative Ideas Simple Solutions to perform the following work effort.<br /><br /><br />The Integrated Partner Management (IPM) Initiative is a strategic effort that will, through process reengineering and process automation provide, in one solution, improved eligibility, enrollment, and oversight processes used to manage partner entities (i.e., schools, school servicers, lenders, lender servicers, guarantee agencies, private collection agencies, state agencies, federal agencies, accrediting agencies, auditors, and owners) as they administer Title IV Financial Aid for students.</p>
<p>Today, many Department of Education (hereafter also referred to as ED or the Department) Federal Student Aid (FSA) applications manage these processes, which result in duplicate and conflicting data storage, complex system architecture, excessive file exchange activities, and the lack of a centralized view of partners. The IPM Solution will reduce these issues, ensuring that all customers and employees have access to the same, current, institutional eligibility, enrollment, and oversight data. Schools, lenders, guarantors and other partners are located throughout the world. FSA's monitoring and oversight staff are located at FSA headquarters (Washington, DC) and throughout the U.S. in ten regional offices.</p>
<p>The IPM Solution will be a single implemented system, ultimately transitioning all functionality from the current legacy systems. In general, the requirements for the overall IPM Solution were developed based on partner management business needs. The IPM Initiative goals are to:<br />1. Improve staff efficiency by providing a more effective tool set for case management and a seamless repository for information access &amp; retention,<br />2. Provide a scalable platform to satisfy future requirements,<br />3. Reduce FSA's risk and reliance upon out of date and unsupported technologies,<br />4. Increase assurance that our program compliance support technology is recoverable after a disaster,<br />5. Establish a base of information that is more accessible and more secure, and<br />6. Provide efficient processes to meet internal and external reporting requirements.</p>
<p>The scope of this effort includes the technical design and development of user interfaces, software/application, systems implementation, integrated solutions, and COTS customization.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK
Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) Perioperative Standards and Recommended Practices Subscription

A.	General Information
1.0		Introduction:
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) requires access to the AORN Perioperative Standards and Recommended Practices subscription via the Internet. The subscription will be accessed by all 153 VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) for common access to patient care. 

The rationale behind the value of this manual is that VHA National Program Office for Sterile Processing has identified this resource as authoritative, up to date, relevant, and the best practice by industry standards to the needs of ensuring the delivery of safe patient care.

Performance Period: 1 year subscription with 4 option years. 

1.1	Objectives

To make available VA-wide and to all 153 VAMCs access to this online resource to support direct patient care activities of VHA.


2.0	Scope of Work:

Site license for the Department of Veterans Affairs to the AORN Perioperative Standards and Recommended Practice 
The Perioperative Standards and Recommended Practices contains the AORN approved standards, recommended practices, guidelines, and guidance statements. These comprehensive documents reflect the perioperative Registered Nurse (RN's) scope of professional responsibility and provide essential information for the delivery of safe patient care and a safe work environment.  They guide perioperative nursing practice while allowing for flexibility and adoptability in all settings where surgical and other invasive procedures are performed.
The PeriOperative Standards and Recommended Practices contains the AORN approved standards, recommended practices, guidelines, and guidance statements regarding the reprocessing of reusable medical equipment (RME).  The proper reprocessing of RME is crucial for the safe delivery of surgical care to Veterans.  Sterile Processing Service personnel rely on up to date information in order to ensure the safe reprocessing of RME.  This is also in keeping with the principles of ISO 9001, standardization of documentation and processes which VHA has begun to implement. 
The AORN PeriOperative Standards and Recommended Practices in conjunction with the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) ST-79, Comprehensive Guide to Steam Sterilization and Sterility Assurance in Health Care Facilities form the foundation of Health Care Facility Sterile Processing Services.  VHA National and local policy makers rely on these documents when developing policy governing the reprocessing of RME.

The factors are listed in order of descending importance.  Please see rating chart for evaluation standards.<br><br>1.	TECHNICAL CAPABILITY/RISK RATING:<br><br>SUBFACTOR A: The proposal provided adequate evidence of contractor's ability to meet critical -85 minimum signal strength as shown on map and Non-Critical areas a minimum signal strength of -95 as shown on map.<br><br>SUBFACTOR B:	Availability of coverage for both the Continental United States and International locations was indicated in the proposal and meet the requirements. <br><br>Proposed devices operate at no less than the latest technology of 3G or better and meet minimum Army requirements. Proposal displayed ability to meet Army standards as listed in the Scope of Work.<br><br>SUBFACTOR C: 	Proposed Blackberry devices are capable of operating with a Common Access Card (CAC) reader connected.<br><br>Devices are compatible with sync operations within a Windows 7 Operating System and are forward compatible with new Operating Systems as the Army changes.<br><br>		SUBFACTOR D:	 Offerors Wi-Fi devices are compatible with current Army Virtual Private Network (VPN) enabled laptops and support no less than 4 users simultaneously at a minimum of 3G or upgraded to current technology at no cost to the Government.<br><br>	SUBFACTOR E: Administrative approach. Contractor's plan to submit invoices in 			     Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) or other electronic submission <br>     method is considered feasible for streamlining and simplifying <br>     the payment process. The contractor proposes the ability to <br>     allow designated Government representatives to access their     <br>     website in order to make administrative changes to devices  <br>     which include but are not limited to: device activation and <br>     deactivation; changes to user names; voicemail password reset;  <br>     etc. Offeror proposes other customer service alternatives which<br>     provide easier account access and trouble-free administration of     <br>     account. <br><br>2.      PAST PERFORMANCE/PERFORMANCE RATING<br><br>SUBFACTOR A: All contractors are required to provide references of contracts where they have provided equipment similar to the requirements of this solicitation within the past three years.<br><br>SUBFACTOR B:  Each contractor will be evaluated on their performance under existing or prior contracts for similar equipment.  Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which contractor's relative ranking will be compared to assure best value to the Government.  The Government will focus on information to include performance risk that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  The Government may contact references other than those identified by the contractor and the information received used in the evaluation of the contractor's past performances.<br><br>SUFACTOR C:  In providing references the contractor shall identify the following:  Company or Organization name, point of contact, telephone number, fax number, email address, contract number and project title.  Contractors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing thorough and complete past performance information rests with the contractor.<br><br>3.       PRICE:  <br><br>The Department of Defense is committed to apply Best Value contracting as a means to select the overall best performers for timely delivery of quality products, while reducing the Governments' administrative costs associated with contractor oversight.  The Government is evaluating factors in addition to pricing under this solicitation and such, may award a contract for more than the lowest priced offer.<br><br>The Army will perform a price analysis in accordance with FAR 15.805-2 as supplemented to determine the reasonableness of each contractor's proposed price for the project.  Competing contractors who propose reasonable prices will be compared to one another on the basis of their prices to establish the relative competitiveness of those prices.  In addition to the reasonable/competitive analysis, and as a part of the greatest value determination, the evaluation of the contractor's cost or price proposal and degree of its importance will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factors on which selection is to be made. Thus, contractors are hereby notified that although price is not expected to be the controlling factor in the selection of a contractor for this solicitation, the degree of importance of price as a factor could become greater depending on the equality of the proposals for other factors evaluated; where competing proposals are determined to be substantially equal, total price and other price considerations would become the controlling factor. Option will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2.<br><br><br>FACTORS INFORMATION<br><br>Factor 1 (Technical Capability/Risk Rating), Factor 2 (Past Performance/Risk Rating) and Factor 3 (Price) are factors that will be evaluated.  All sub-factors within Factor 1 are major sub-factors.  If the proposal does not provide adequate evidence that these requirements will be met, the proposal will be determined to be technically unacceptable.  Price is highly significant in that the Government will not award a contract where price will exceed available program funding. The proposer should be aware that the Government considers technical approach/risk rating and past performance/performance risk of higher importance than price, and will not accept items of generally lower quality to gain a minor advantage in price.  If two or more proposals are rated of equal merit, price will determine their final ranking order.<br>	<br><br>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 <br>PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:<br>1.

The rating for the Technical factor and subfactors will be expressed as an adjectival assessment of Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable or Unacceptable.<br><br>	2.  Technical Capability/Risk Rating Sub-Factor Rating Definitions.   The following rating definitions will be utilized in the evaluation of the Technical Sub-factors (the Technical factor will be a "roll-up" of the Technical sub-factor ratings):<br><br>Combined Technical/Risk Ratings<br>Rating	Description<br>Outstanding	Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional<br>approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths<br>far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful<br>performance is very low.<br>Good	Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough<br>approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal<br>contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of<br>unsuccessful performance is low.<br>Acceptable	Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate<br>approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths<br>and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact<br>on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance<br>is no worse than moderate.<br>Marginal	Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not<br>demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal has one or more weaknesses<br>which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful<br>performance is high.<br>Unacceptable	Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or<br>more deficiencies. Proposal is unawardable.<br><br><br> <br>	3.

Length of service includes<br>the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor,<br>wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of<br>similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)<br><br>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br>King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br>Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A<br>contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br>accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)<br><br><br><br>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:<br><br>1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br>not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br>administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because<br>most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br>not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br>week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br>400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br>within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not<br>list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br>data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br>$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For<br>example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br>within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br>occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br>then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br>conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br>determination.<br><br>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br>industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br>professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br>who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br>    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br>consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br>specifications;<br>    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br>modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br>related to user or system design specifications;<br>    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br>programs related to machine operating systems; or<br>    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br>requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<br><br>2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you<br>work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br>and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br> If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br>regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br>premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br>(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br>overtime work).<br><br><br>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br>employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br>in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This<br>includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br>ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br>and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br>  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br>on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations<br>involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.<br><br>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br>represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br>ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br>which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br>employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br>like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br>All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br>incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials<br>are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br>ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<br><br>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<br><br>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br>(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br>local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br>laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br>employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br>determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br>following standards as compliance:<br><br>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br>adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br>cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br>the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br>this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br>agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br>affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br>and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in<br>those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br>materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br>not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br>laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br>of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br>there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.<br><br>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br>"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br>unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br>links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br>gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br>http://wdol.gov/.<br><br>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br>1444 (SF 1444)}<br><br>Conformance Process:<br><br>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br>not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br>be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br>determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br>relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br>classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such<br>conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br>fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br>the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br>of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br>be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br>When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br>should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br>conformed.<br><br>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<br><br>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br>occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).<br><br>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br>proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br>proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br>rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br>authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br>representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the<br>contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br>performs any contract work.<br><br>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br>of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br>information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br>and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br>for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<br><br>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br>disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br>notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br>the request.<br><br>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<br><br>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<br><br>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.<br><br>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br>Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br>that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br>wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br>determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br>Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br>classifications listed in the wage determination.<br>

<DESC>Defense Logistics Agency has a requirement for Hewlett-Packard Universal Power Supply Hardware and Firmware Upgrades. This is issued as Request for Quotation (RFQ) # SP4707-12-Q-0033. Place of performance is Battle Creek, Michigan. Inspection, acceptance and F.O.B. are at destination, Battle Creek, Michigan. Delivery shall be no later than 30 calendar days after award date.
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular #2055-55.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being solicited on an unrestricted basis in regards to small business programs. The associated NAICS code is 335999 with a SBA size standard of 500 in employment.</p>
<p>Offerors shall provide a price for each contract line item number (CLIN) in their quote. Quotes with quantities of more/ less than requested or products other than those specifically requested will be deemed technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>CLIN Descriptions: (See also attached SOW)</p>
<p>CLIN 001: Hewlett-Packard (HP) Install Universal Power Supply 3KVA to Below 6KVA Service, P/N: U4693E, QTY: 02 EA.</p>
<p>CLIN 002: Hewlett-Packard R5KVA UPS 3U L630 HV North America/ Japan Kit, P/N: AF460A, QTY: 02 EA.</p>
<p>CLIN 003: Hewlett Packard R5KVA and R7KVA 3U Extended Runtime Module, P/N: AF464A, QTY: 02 EA.</p>
<p>CLIN 004: Hewlett-Packard Additional Tech Assistance, SEE ATTACHED SOW, S/N: HA334A1, QTY: 05 EA.</p>
<p>Only new equipment is being solicited. Remanufactured or refurbished equipment, as defined in FAR 11.001, is technically unacceptable. Trade-in or exchange of old equipment is not available.</p>
<p>Redacted Brand Name Justification: Since the current exchange system being upgraded is all Hewlett-Packard equipment and software, the upgraded equipment should be from the same manufacturer. This will minimize fireware driver issues; reduce downtimes, and other connection failover issues. Hewlett-Packard equipment is required to ensure compatibility with the existing infrastructure. Another manufacturer's equipment will introduce new software, drivers, and connection technology. This has the risk of causing potential conflicts, upgrade issues, and potentially cause further down times.</p>
<p>Offeror shall be an authorized Hewlett-Packard channel distributor/ resell partner in order to provide this brand name requirement. Quotes that are not sourcing from within Hewlett-Packards authorized channels will be rated technically acceptable.</p>
<p>The evaluation factor(s) for award is; lowest-price, technically acceptable. Any resulting contract or order will be firm-fixed price.</p>
<p>Place "SP4707-12-Q-0033" in the subject field of any e-mail correspondence. Responses are due on Thursday 3/8/2012 by 4:00 PM EST. Late quotes shall not be considered. Please include your Cage Code with your quote.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SOLICITATION PROVISIONS</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-1 Instruction of Offerors-Commercial items applies to this acquisition. Addenda to 52.212-1: The following paragraphs are herby deleted from this provision: (e) Multiple offers and (h) multiple awards.</p>
<p>FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal (Aug 1999)</p>
<p>(a) If an item in this solicitation is identified as "brand name or equal," the purchase description reflects the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government's needs. The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that "equal" products must meet are specified in the solicitation.<br />(b) To be considered for award, offers of "equal" products, including "equal" products of the brand name manufacturer, must-<br />(1) Meet the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristic specified in this solicitation;<br />(2) Clearly identify the item by-<br />(i) Brand name, if any; and<br />(ii) Make or model number;<br />(3) Include descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer; and<br />(4) Clearly describe any modification the offeror plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements. Mark any descriptive material to clearly show the modification.<br />(c) The Contracting Officer will evaluate "equal" products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer.<br />(d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an "equal" product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DLAD 52.233-9000 AGENCY PROTESTS (NOV, 2011)</p>
<p>Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the Contracting Officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity's Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.<br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>DLAD 52.233-9001 DISPUTES: AGREEMENT TO USE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) (NOV, 2011)</p>
<p>(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1, or for the agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the Contracting Officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate.</p>
<p>(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here ( ). Alternate wording may be negotiated with the Contracting Officer.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

<p>This combined synopsis/solicitation is NOT the entire RFP. To receive the entire RFP (ITO, Evaluation Factors, etc), please see the instructions below. FAILURE TO FOLLOW these instructions will NOT constitute a reason to grant an extension to the RFP period at a later date.</p>

The link is listed below and the ITSS Help Desk number is 1-877-243-2889. ITSS webpage is https://web.itss.gsa.gov/Login.</p>
<p>Offerors shall use ITSS to receive the entire RFP and submit its proposal. THE DOCUMENTS IN ITSS ARE THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS TO BE USED FOR SOLICITATION. To receive the entire RFP, and submit a proposal for consideration for award, all interested Offerors send GSA an email identifying (1) vendor's name, and (2) the name of an individual Offeror employee who will act as the Offeror's GSA point of contact (POC) for this requirement that is "registered in IT Solution Shop (ITSS)". OFFERORS MUST IDENTIFY THE COMPANY NAME OF THE OFFEROR AND THE POC'S NAME EXACTLY AS IT APPEARS IN ITSS. "Registered in ITSS" or "Registration in ITSS" means a Offeror is successfully registered in ITSS such that the Government can select Vendor's designated POC in ITSS to receive the RFP, view an order, and be able to submit a proposal. Some Offerors have multiple company divisions and employees registered in ITSS making it difficult for GSA selection. Therefore, to ensure that all interested Offerors receive the RFP, prompt submission of the above ITSS vendor information (Offeror's name and POC) is requested. An email must be sent to jennifer.metcalf@gsa.gov or bernard.fordham@gsa.gov in order to receive RFP via ITSS. You may also contact Jennifer Metcalf at 404-331-2822 or Bernard Fordham at 228-813-4875. This will ensure that potential Offeror receive a copy of the RFP and have the opportunity to submit a proposal. The proposal closing date in ITSS is 4:00 pm on May3, 2012 (EST). Extension to the RFP closing date and time will not be granted due to late registration in ITSS or not being registered in ITSS. Any proposal received by GSA after the closing date/time is late and shall not be evaluated and will not be considered for award.</p>

<p><br />REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT</p>
<p>04 April 2012</p>
<p>Satellite Emergency Notification Device (SEND)</p>
<p>1.0 Introduction</p>
<p>1.1 Forest Service employees routinely work in the wilderness. Their main mean of communication while in the wilderness is 2 way radios. Normally the employees use mobile and handheld radios to communicate their locations and status to the dispatch center. Approximately 20% of the forest is outside of the area of coverage of radios because of terrains.</p>
<p>1.2 A Satellite Emergency Notification Device or SEND is a portable emergency notification and locating device which uses commercial satellite systems to transmit GPS location based distress, check-in, and tracking messages. SEND devices use an internal GPS chip to gather location information. When the SEND SOS distress feature is triggered, this information is sent via commercial satellite to a commercial monitoring agency whose role is to pass the information to an appropriate responding agency. Depending on the make and model, device buttons vary but typically include S.O.S., tracking and preconfigured canned message(s). When messages sent from a SEND are received, the monitoring individual can view the device location overlaid on a base map.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-48.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 335314 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.</p>
<p>This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement to replace an Extrapolation Range Motor Controller System; used and/or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>All responsible quoters shall provide a quotation for the following line item:</p>
<p>LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity one (1) each, Extrapolation Range Motor Controller System that shall meet or exceed the following required specifications:</p>
<p>PURPOSE:<br />The RF Fields Group requires an Extrapolation Range upgrade in the Antenna Metrology Lab. The existing system is not operational and is not supported by the manufacturer. This will require replacing the motor and chain drive for the linear axis (referred to as the "z-axis"), and a rotating axis (referred to as the "rotation axis"). Both of these axes are controlled by a single desktop unit (i.e. multi-axis motor controller), which will also need to be replaced. All required cables, including a hand held remote will also be replaced. The new system will be installed and made operational by the supplier.<br />A cart/carriage currently runs the length of the z-axis. This carriage has a maximum weight of 1 Ton, and houses the current motor that moves it along the z-axis rails via a chain drive. The rails are approximately 45 feet in length.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>Z-Axis<br />&bull; Provide and install a new motor that connects to the new or existing chain drive. It is up to the suppliers' discretion if they would like to include any motor amplifiers and/or gearboxes. NIST's experience indicates that a servo motor (with amplifier) and a gearbox may be the best solution, but NIST will consider other solutions. <br />&bull; Provide and install all mounting hardware required to mount the motor (and other hardware (i.e. amplifier, gearbox, etc.) to the existing z-axis carriage. <br />&bull; Provide and install all cables, power, encoder/feedback, etc. We estimate the required length of these cables will be 100 feet. Suppliers have the option of using an existing cable track. Should the existing cable track not be suitable, the supplier is responsible for including a replacement in their quote. <br />&bull; The system must be able to move the z-axis carriage at any specified speed between 1mm/sec to 150mm/sec. The system must be able to consistently maintain the speed at which it's commanded to move.</p>
<p>Rotation/Polarization-Axis<br />&bull; Provide and install a new motor for the rotation/polarization axis. This axis needs to be able to rotate a 50 pound load, not including the translation stages or mounting plates (specified below). <br />&bull; The system must be able to rotate the load at any specified speed between 1 and 6 RPM. The system must be able to consistently maintain the speed at which it's commanded to move. <br />&bull; Provide and install all mounting hardware required to mount the motor (and other hardware, i.e. amplifier, gearbox, etc.) to the existing structure. <br />&bull; All components for this axis must be mounted/enclosed in EMI rated, protective housing. <br />&bull; The system must have the ability to be jogged manually, or moved to a discrete position. When moved to a discrete position, the system must have a positioning repeatability of 0.01 degrees or better. <br />&bull; Provide and install all cables, power, encoder/feedback, etc. We estimate the required length of these cables will be 50 feet. <br />&bull; Part of the motor load (not included in the 50 pound specification) will be a set of manual x-y translation stages. These stages should have a travel of 200 mm in each the x and y direction. The translation stages must have a brake that can be manually engaged. A machined adapter plate will be mounted to translation stage that facilitates the use of NIST's existing antenna mounting hardware. Suppliers will be shown (and be able to measure) NIST's antenna mounting hardware at the specified on-site visit. The weight of the mounting hardware will not exceed 10 pounds, and is not considered part of the 50 pound load specification.</p>
<p>Controller and Hand Held Remote<br />&bull; Both motor controllers should be mounted in a single enclosure that will be placed on a tabletop next to a desktop computer (computer will not be supplied through this acquisition).<br />&bull; This enclosure should also have a single emergency stop switch capable of immediately stopping motion on both axes.<br />&bull; The controller(s) mounted inside the enclosure must be capable of being controlled remotely using a PC. Acceptable means of communication include (and are limited to) RS-232 serial, Ethernet, USB, and GPIB. The supplier is responsible for providing the syntax manual for the programming language used by the controller. <br />&bull; A hand remote control/pendant with 40' of cable is required. The pendant will have variable speed control and direction of both axes, along with an emergency stop button. The pendant should be hard wired to the controller box.</p>
<p>Other Information:<br />With the quote, the offeror must include a list of changes that needs to be made to the structure of the rotating axis and/or the z-axis carriage. Preference will be given to suppliers who propose a solution that requires no/minimal modification to our existing structures.</p>
<p>Preference will be given to vendors who propose a system that can run off of a standard 120 VAC, 30 Amp circuit. <br />Preference will be given to suppliers who have a local support team that can quickly respond to NIST in the event of an equipment failure.</p>
<p>The supplier should refrain from using any wireless devices (i.e. any intentional wireless transmissions that carry data) to meet the above specification. Proposals that include the use of wireless devices (i.e. wireless remotes) will be eliminated from consideration.</p>
<p>All of the existing motors and cabling will be removed by NIST personnel prior to the on-site installation of the new system.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLE SCHEDULE: <br />Preference will be given to vendors who can have the system installed and operational within 12 weeks of award. Please provide a delivery schedule with your quote.</p>
<p>Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before installation and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver and install all line items to NIST, Building 24, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305.</p>

<CONTACT>Matthew White 831-656-2340 mjwhite@nps.edu
<DESC>The Naval Postgraduate Schools (NPS) Center for Asymmetric Warfare (CAW) implemented a Sensor Island concept providing an unprecedented capability to integrate dynamic sensors and sensor platforms for response missions enhancing situational awareness across participating homeland security and disaster response organizations. The Sensor Island provides a robust, trusted infrastructure and connection technologies that allow sensors, sensor platforms, and sensor users to interact, interoperate, and meet those challenges.

The Sensor Island includes system and software components that translate sensor and platform information into open geospatial consortium output that can be consumed by multiple common operational pictures from advance emergency operations center geographic information system displays to smart phones.

The CAW requires contractual services of operational and subject matter expertise in GIS and sensor integration to support the integration and visualization of various sensor elements into existing and proposed multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional exercise and operational experimentation events.
  The CAW has planned requirements for the Sensor Island and its capabilities to support exercise and research activity supported out of the CAW facility in Pt. Mugu, CA. 

The CAW requires that the Sensor Island, established at the CAWs Pt. Mugu facility, be updated and upgraded, configured, and optimized to include the latest underlying geographic systems, database, and Smart Points software.  The updated Sensor Island will be used in planned exercises (e.g. Coastal Trident 2012) and research interests (e.g. NPS Remote Sensing) spanning the CAWs client base as well as supporting the larger mission of the Naval Postgraduate School.

General<br><br>a.	This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is a competitive solicitation procedure used to obtain proposals for basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement. The BAA is described in FAR 6.102, "Use of Competitive Procedures," and FAR 35.016, "Broad Agency Announcements."  The Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984 issued as Public Law 98-369 (98 stat, 1175 et seq.) authorizes use of "general solicitations" or Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs). The use of general solicitations is limited by CICA to "basic research proposals." Contracts awarded under these general solicitations meet the "full and open" competition requirements of CICA.<br><br>b.	The Technical Center BAA, W9113M-09-0001 supercedes USASMDC BAAs W9113M-05-0011entitled New and Innovative Ideas for Space Science and Technology, W9113M-05-0009 entitled New and Innovative Ideas for Advanced Technology Exploitation, and DASG60-00-0005 entitled Innovative Ideas for Advanced Technology Opportunities.<br><br>2.	Organizational Overview<br><br>	The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT, hereafter referred to as SMDC) Technical Center announces interest in receiving research, development, and technology maturation proposals with technical, management, and cost presentations.  Proposals submitted should include new ideas for advanced and innovative concepts as well as prototype hardware and software for current and emerging air, space and missile defense science and technology.  The Technical Center (TC) conducts space, directed energy, missile defense, cruise missile defense and related technology research and development for the Army, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO), the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office, and other defense-related government agencies. Furthermore, the TC plans and executes missile defense test and evaluation programs and related analysis. The TC is interested in pursuing numerous opportunities for technical cooperation and partnerships with academia, industry, and international organizations. <br><br>3.	Invitation to Submit Proposals<br><br>a.	SMDC is interested in receiving proposals for the basic and applied research efforts described under this BAA. This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make any award or to pay for any response preparation costs. The cost of proposal preparation for response to a BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract; however, it may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. <br><br>b.	Certain proposals are not appropriate under this BAA and are not desired.  Engineering and technical services proposals are not appropriate.  These usually involve applying effort toward a broadly identified task, often on a level-of-effort basis, rather than delivery of an end item such as a final report.  This BAA seeks proposals for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding.  Proposals related to the development of a specific system or to satisfy specific hardware/software requirements are also not appropriate.  A determination of appropriateness will be made as part of the BAA submission screening process. <br><br>c.	Awards under this BAA are expected to take the form of contracts. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712 -- Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences, with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees.  Technical and cost proposals submitted under this BAA will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 3.104-4 and 15.207.  Cognizant Government experts will perform the evaluation of technical proposals.  Cost proposals will be evaluated by Government business professionals.  <br><br>d.	This BAA should not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of a contract; the Government is not bound to make any awards under this announcement. Funds may not be currently available for topics under this BAA. No contract award will be made for a topic until appropriated funds are available from which payment for contract purposes can be made. <br><br>e.	The BAA technique shall only be used when meaningful proposals with varying technical/scientific approaches can be reasonably anticipated. Note that SMDC does not presently have inherent programmed funding for every topic area under this BAA; therefore, any awards under presently unfunded areas will depend on availability of funding, to include funding from other Government sources.  <br><br>f.	Proposals may be submitted by any U.S. non-governmental entity, including commercial firms, institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science or engineering (universities), or by consortia led by such concerns, research institutions and non-profit organizations. Foreign subcontract participation will be at the unclassified level.  <br><br>g.	SMDC encourages participation by small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions. However, no part of this BAA is specifically reserved for these entities as contemplated by FAR 19.201 and DFARS 235.016.<br><br>h.	Interested parties should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published. <br> <br><br>4.	Technology Areas of Interest<br>	The areas of technology research and development the TC is interested in receiving proposals in include radar, optics, interceptors, space technology, solid-state lasers, high power microwaves, material and manufacturing technology, lethality, survivability, communications, cyber warfare, information operations, kill assessment, cruise missile defense, and other air, space, and missile defense initiatives.  All submissions should demonstrate potential military application. Technology proposal categories the TC is specifically interested in receiving proposals under are as follows.  The areas of interest include possible subcategories of interest.  The categories include capabilities and technologies to develop, integrate, and demonstrate application to the areas/categories listed.

Fundamental Research<br>	Research is not anticipated to be fundamental in nature as defined in National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 189.<br>6.	Award Considerations<br>	The selection of proposals for contract award will be based on an evaluation of proposals submitted in response to the BAA. The major purpose of the evaluation will be to determine the relative merit of the proposed technology and the feasibility of the technical approach of each proposal. Business and contractual aspects, including proposed cost and cost realism, will also be considered as part of the evaluation. Selection of proposals for award will be based on the potential benefits to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of funds.  The Government reserves the right to request revisions to contractor proposals and statements of work including requests for clarification, risk mitigation plans, changes to proposed period of performance, CDRL requirements or other changes as necessary to better align with the SMDC/ARSTRAT mission.  This BAA constitutes the solicitation.  This announcement will become effective upon publication and will remain open for one year from date of publication.<br>7.	Proposal Preparation<br><br>	In order to streamline the proposal process and to assist offerors in determining whether to incur the cost of generating a formal BAA proposal, it is requested that offerors first submit a summary White Paper for preliminary consideration.  Offerors are encouraged, but are not required to submit white papers, nor are they precluded by the Government's advice on a white paper from submitting a formal proposal. White papers will be considered as soon as they are received.  Acknowledgement of receipt of white papers will not be made, and white papers will not be returned.<br>a.  White Paper Instructions<br>The purpose of the White Paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed initiative is not of interest to SMDC.<br>(1)  BREVITY IS DESIRABLE - WHITE PAPERS ARE LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN 5 PAGES on 8.5" x 11" paper and of English text.  It shall be single-spaced, Times New Roman 12 point font with 1 inch left, right, top and bottom margins with one (1) additional page for technical drawing(s) and one (1) additional page for a simplistic delivery schedule and cost profile if necessary. The electronic file size shall be no larger than 2MB.<br>(2)  The summary white paper should capture the proposed technical concept, together with its rationale and objectives, methodology, the expected results, and its contribution to SMDC.  The white paper should conceptualize a rough schedule at a "top level".<br>(3)  Submit one White Paper per Technology Category, clearly identifying both the Technology Category, and if applicable, the subcategory cited in the BAA under that Technology Area. Summary white papers may be submitted at any time after issuance of this BAA through the expiration date of 6 April 2013.  From this summary white paper the Government will indicate whether the subject matter technology described is of interest to the Technical Center and will determine whether a formal proposal would be likely to succeed.  The Government may provide comments that might be of assistance to the offeror in determining how or whether to submit a BAA proposal<br>(4)  Offerors of those White Papers found to be of interest and consistent with the intent of the BAA will be invited to submit formal cost and technical proposals. An invitation does not assure an offeror of a subsequent contract award. <br>(5)  Any proprietary data which the offeror intends to be used by SMDC only for evaluation purposes must be specifically identified in the summary white paper or proposal and marked in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(e).  The SMDC Contracting and Acquisition Management Office (CAMO) will generally notify offerors within four (4) months of white paper receipt if a full proposal is required.  White papers not selected for full proposal submission will be disposed of in a manner that protects proprietary data.  <br>(6)  The summary white paper may be submitted as a hard copy and/or in electronic format with file size no larger than 2MB. The electronic copy should be provided in MS Word-compatible format as well as a PDF file sent by e-mail (preferred) to retha.adams@smdc.army.mil.  Otherwise, submit the white paper by mail to USASMDC/ARSTRAT, PO Box 1500, ATTN: CCAM-CAB-B (R. Adams), Huntsville, AL 35807-3801.  The address when using Federal Express is U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, Attn:  CCAM-CAB-B (R. Adams), Von Braun Complex III, Bldg 5224, Room 1-E-210, Redstone Arsenal, AL  35898.  For all hand-carry deliveries, please make an appointment with the Contracting Officer for pickup by phone or email at 256-955-5989 or retha.adams@smdc.army.mil. A CD with an electronic copy of the white paper, as described above, shall accompany the hard copy if the mail option is selected.<br>(a)  Classified responses (up to Secret collateral) can be mailed or transmitted via SIPRNET email.  If mailed, the response must be appropriately marked, sealed, and mailed in accordance with classified material handling procedures.  Please utilize the guidance as stated in item (6) above.  The Classified mailing address is USASMDC/ARSTRAT, PO Box 1500, Huntsville, AL  35807-3801.  The outer envelope should be addressed to the attention of SMDC-IM (Document Control) and the inner envelope should be addressed to the attention of CCAM-CAB-B (Retha Adams).  If transmitted via SIPRNET email, send to amy.aguirre@smdc.army.smil.mil and use the document title as the subject.  Only classified white papers should be submitted via SIPRNET.  The document shall be appropriately marked with agency address, classification authority/declassification instructions, document date and distribution statement, and transmitted in MS Word-compatible electronic file format as well as a separate PDF file and must include all information requested in this BAA.  Notify CAMO via NIPRNET, retha.adams@smdc.army.mil, that you have sent a classified white paper on the SIPRNET.  Classification does not in any way eliminate the offeror's requirements to comply with all instructions in this BAA.<br>b.  Proposal Instructions<br>Proposals shall consist of two volumes:  Volume I, Technical and Management Proposal and Volume II, Cost Proposal.  Proposals shall include the basic effort and options (if applicable). All proposals should clearly indicate limitations on the disclosure of their contents.<br>(1)  In presenting the proposal material, prospective offerors are advised that quality of the information is significantly more important than the quantity. Therefore, offerors are requested to confine their submissions to essential matters, providing sufficient information to define their offer and establish an adequate basis for the Government to conduct its evaluation. <br>(2)  Volume I is the Technical and Management Proposal.  Volume I has three sections:  Section I (Technical) and Section II (Management) which shall not exceed 50 pages and  Section III (Other Documents) which shall not have page limitations.  (A page is defined as being single-sided, no larger than 8.5" x 11", 1-inch margins, with fonts no smaller than 12 point.  Accordion-style foldouts will be counted as multiple pages equivalent to the expanded size.)  The page limitation for proposals includes all figures, tables (except the table of contents), and charts.  All pages that exceed the maximum page limit specified may be removed and not be reviewed or considered in the evaluation.  <br>(3)  Volume I shall include a cover sheet. Volume I, Section I shall include the Executive Summary, Nature of Research, Meets BAA Requirements, Milestone Schedule, Prior Experience, Statement of Work (SOW)/Deliverables.  Volume I, Section II shall include the Management Approach, Capabilities/Qualifications and any required government resources (equipment, facilities, computer time, etc.).

Date proposal was prepared<br>(b)  Executive Summary: The first page of the proposal must be an executive summary of the proposed technical and management approaches.  <br>(c)  Nature of Research: The technical portion of the proposal must include a full discussion of the nature and scope of the research effort contemplated, including the method of approach and the expected results. <br>(d)  Meets BAA Requirements: The proposal shall fully discuss how the initiative falls within the definition of Basic and Applied Research as defined in FAR 35.016 with development not exceeding Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 which is a system/ subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment.  The proposal shall discuss the potential contribution of the proposed research to SMDC.  The offeror shall certify that the initiative is not submitted to fulfill the requirements of any specific system or sub-system.<br>(e)  Milestone Schedule:  The offerors shall discuss the merits of each phase of the initiative proposed, and conditions upon which each phase will be assessed.  A program milestone chart, which includes a detailed list of tasks and subtasks and the duration of same, must be provided. Offerors are to clearly identify a list of contract deliverables which are traceable to the milestone chart. These milestones should include the timeframes for preparation, delivery, review, and approval for all draft and final reports, as appropriate. <br>(f)  Prior Experience:  Offerors must include any information pertaining to prior significant and related work experience as well as a description of available facilities and the resumes of all key personnel who will be participating in the effort. <br>(g)  SOW/Deliverables:  Offerors must keep in mind that portions of the technical proposal will usually be incorporated by reference into any resultant contract; it serves as the basis for work to be accomplished. Therefore, the technical proposal must include a statement of work that describes the work to be accomplished and any deliverables. Each task description should be written to facilitate evaluation and acceptance without the need for major rewrites prior to incorporation into the resultant contract. <br>(h)  Management Approach:  The offeror should provide the necessary scheduling and planning documentation that fully describes the proposed program, which should include the offeror's approach for controlling expenditures and labor hours.  Include in the proposal a summary description of management planning and control systems and product assurance.  <br>(i)  Capabilities/Qualifications: The proposal should discuss the offeror's capabilities and qualifications including discussion of: 1) key personnel; 2) adequacy of offeror's facilities and instrumentation; and 3) identification of plans for any potential safety and environmental concerns.  <br>(j)  U.S. offerors who meet the security requirement of the SMDC Simulation Center may request government furnished computer time, not to exceed 30 System Resources Unit hours per contract.  Proposal shall request computer time and amount if it is required.  Also, if required, identify facility and facility test time.  <br>(k)  The Other Documents section of the proposal shall include the items below.<br>1.  The offeror shall provide a separate SOW, bearing no proprietary markings, suitable for contractual incorporation. If options are proposed, the SOW must clearly differentiate between the basic and options.  To aid in insertion of the SOW in the contractual instrument, request the following guidelines be followed in formatting any electronic file provided:<br> 	All auto numbering and bullets must be removed<br> 	All text should be saved in Times New Roman 12 point font<br> 	Bolding and underlining is not recommended<br> 	All graphics must be removed<br> 	All files inserted from other applications in the MS Word file should be removed<br> 	The submission of other supporting materials along with the proposal is strongly discouraged and will not be considered for review.<br>2.  Prime Contractor Small Business Subcontracting Plan:  (Applicable to other than small business offerors)  (It is noted that educational institutions are considered other than small business offerors)  In accordance with FAR 19.702(a)(1), if the total amount of the proposal exceeds $650,000, a small business subcontracting plan, and small business subcontracting goals must be addressed.  FAR part 52.219-9 defines a subcontracting plan and its requirements. This information must be submitted with your proposal.  It is the policy of the Government to enable small business and small disadvantaged business concerns to be considered fairly as subcontractors to contractors performing work or rendering services as prime contractors or subcontractors under Government contracts, and to assure that prime contractors and subcontractors carry out this policy.  The plan format is outlined in FAR 19.704. Offerors are cautioned that the Government will not execute a contract unless the Contracting Officer determines that the negotiated plan provides the maximum practicable opportunity for SBs, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, and Veteran-owned Small Business concerns or HBCUs/MIs to participate in the performance of the contract.  Offerors should note that DFARS 219.705-4 has provided for a goal of 5% or higher for SDB concerns. <br>3.  Representations and Certifications:  Prospective contractors shall complete electronic representations and certification at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The representations and certifications must be updated as necessary, but at least annually, to ensure they are kept current, accurate, and complete. (See FAR Subpart 4.12).  These representations and certifications will need to be supplemented by other representations and certifications, to include DFARS 252.227-7017 and 252.227-7028.  <br>4.  The offeror may include an attached bibliography of relevant technical papers or research notes (published and unpublished), that document the technical ideas and approach upon which the proposal is based.  Copies of not more than three (3) relevant papers may be included with the submission.  The three relevant papers may be in .PDF format.  <br>5.  Formatting instructions for Volume I, Section III (Other Documents)<br> 	May/Shall be provided with no page limitation.  <br> 	All auto numbering and bullets must be removed.  <br> 	All text should be saved in Times New Roman 12 point font <br> 	Bolding and underlining is not recommended, but may be used.<br> 	All graphics must be removed.<br> 	All files inserted from other applications into a MS Word file should be removed.<br> 	The submission of other supporting materials along with the proposal is strongly discouraged and will not be considered for review.  <br><br>(4)  Volume II is the Cost Proposal.  Volume II shall include a cover sheet.  It is excluded from page limitations and should follow the guidance of FAR 15.408, Table 15-2. The cost proposal shall contain a summary showing the overall contract price and include details by cost element by Base and Option, and further broken down by contractor fiscal year (CFY) if more than one CFY is under the Base/Option.  In addition, both the basic period and any options shall include separate cost/schedule information.  The cost proposal shall contain data in Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format, with formulas included; and shall, at a minimum, include the following:<br>(a.)  Cover sheet(s) to include:<br>1.	Name and address of offeror (include zip code) and Division (if applicable);<br>2.	Name, title, telephone number, and e-mail address of offeror's point of contact;<br>3.	Place(s) and period(s) of performance;<br>4.	Name, mailing address, email address, telephone number and point of contact of the offeror's cognizant government administration office (i.e., Office of Naval Research/Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA)) (if known);<br>5.	Name, mailing address, email address, telephone number and Point of Contact of the offeror's cognizant audit office (i.e., DCAA/HHR)(if known);<br>6.	Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Code<br>7.	Dun and Bradstreet (DUN) number<br>8.	Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)<br>9.	Whether you will require the use of Government property in the performance of the contract, and, if so, what property.<br>(b.)  The offeror should prepare its cost proposal in a clear, concise manner that accurately reflects its financial plan for accomplishing the proposed technical effort. The costs should be tied to the milestone schedule, clearly allocating costs to each phase of the initiative.  A breakdown of cost data is required under this BAA. If "cost or pricing data" are required to be submitted in accordance with FAR 15.403-4, "Requiring Cost or Pricing Data," the offeror shall provide the information identified in FAR 15.408, "Solicitation Provisions and Contract Clauses/Price Proposals When Cost or Pricing Data Are Required," as well as the information required in this section. When cost of money is being proposed, the offeror shall submit a DD Form 1861. <br>(c.)  The breakdown of "cost or pricing data" or "other than cost or pricing data" shall include all cost expected to be incurred under the contract.  Proposed costs and rates should be fully supported.  IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT THAT ADEQUATE DATA ON SUBCONTRACTORS BE PROVIDED; RATES ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. THE ABSENCE OF ADEQUATE DATA ON SUBCONTRACTORS IS A FREQUENT SOURCE OF AVOIDABLE DELAY IN CONTRACT AWARD. THE CONTRACTOR MAY ENCOURAGE SUBMISSION BY THE SUBCONTRACTOR DIRECT TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IF THE SUBCONTRACTOR IS RELUCTANT TO SUBMIT DATA TO THE PRIME. <br>(d.)  Detailed cost breakdown to include:  Total program cost broken down by Base and Options by CFY (if more than one CFY is under the Base/Option); further broken down by major cost items (direct labor, subcontracts, materials, special test equipment, travel, other direct costs, overhead charges, etc.).<br>(e.)  Prime contractors are responsible for insuring that each proposed subcontract is supported by cost or pricing data when it is both in excess of $700,000, and not covered by an exception or waiver in accordance with FAR 15.403-1. Particular attention is directed to the importance of furnishing complete detailed information and supporting data as indicated in FAR 15.408, Table 15-2.   Include an itemization of major subcontracts (labor, travel, materials, and other direct costs) and equipment purchases, as well as an analysis, performed by the prime contractor, of the subcontract proposal.  Specifically address subcontract proposed hours in the prime analysis.  <br>It is noted that FY 2011, FY 2012 and FY 2013 Basic Research Appropriations may be used to fund awards issued from this BAA.  In the event that Basic Research Appropriations are used, none of the funds under this appropriation may be used to pay negotiated indirect costs in excess of 35% of the total cost of the contract.<br>(f.)  Subcontractor Proposal:  The contractor shall submit, or cause to be submitted by the subcontractor directly to the Government, copies of proposals (broken down by labor hours, rates, categories, indirects, material, etc.) for subcontracts that are the lower of either (a) $11.5 million or more; or (b) both more than $700,000 and more than 10 percent of the prime contractor's proposed price, unless the subcontract is the result of adequate price competition or commercial items.  If an item or subcontract effort is selected by a competitive process, provide quotes or backup documentation received from all eligible offerors and discuss how the best value determination was made.  If subcontract item is less than $11.5M but greater than $700,000 and less than 10% of the proposed cost, provide a quote from the proposing subcontractor. Subcontract proposal should include cover sheet information detailed above.<br>(g.)  All details, broken down by cost element, are to be prepared for each major task with supporting rationale.

The original of each proposal received will be retained at SMDC and all other copies of non-accepted proposals destroyed.  <br><br>8.	Evaluation Criteria <br>(Applicable to proposals only):  The Government selection of the proposal(s) for award will be based on an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the Government considering technical and management relative merit in accordance with the evaluation criteria, cost, best value considerations, availability of funds, and program balance, using the areas and factors set forth below.<br><br>a.	Evaluation Areas/Factors<br><br>(1)	Technical Area -The quality of the offeror's proposed technical approach will be evaluated using the following factors:<br>(a)	Overall Scientific/Technical Quality - The offeror will be evaluated on the overall scientific/technical merits of the proposed research and development.  The degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to SMDC are proposed and feasibility and the offeror's understanding of the proposed approach and technical objectives will be evaluated.  <br>(b)	Qualifications - The offeror's ability to implement the proposed approach as demonstrated by specific accomplishments in the technical field to be studied, by the qualifications (including past and current experience) of the proposed principal investigator and other "key" personnel and availability of appropriate facilities will be evaluated.  <br>(c)	Research and Development Contribution - Potential contribution of the proposed research to SMDC in the above technology areas. The scientific/technical merits include potential for state-of-the-art improvement, with special emphasis on innovation, originality and uniqueness will also be evaluated.<br>(2)	 Management Area - The quality of the offeror's proposed management approach will be evaluated using the following factors:<br>(a)	Overall Scheduling and Planning - The offeror's approach will be evaluated based on the overall scheduling and planning for performance of the effort.<br>(b)	Expenditure Control - The approach for controlling expenditures and labor hours.<br>(c)	Subcontracting Plan:  The extent to which offerors identify and commit to small business and to small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business, women-owned small business, historically black college and university, or minority institution participation in the proposed effort, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor. <br><br>(3)	Cost Area - The cost area evaluation will consider the realism and reasonableness of the proposed cost.  Cost reasonableness will consider the price proposed in conjunction with program objectives and the availability of funding.  Cost realism will assess the likelihood that the technical and management approaches proposed can be successfully accomplished for the cost proposed.  <br><br>b.	Relative importance of Evaluation Criteria<br><br>(1) Technical:  The technical area is significantly more important than the management area.  The factors under the technical area are of equal importance.<br>(2) Management:  The management area is significantly less important than the technical area.  The factors under the management area are of equal importance.<br>(3) Cost: The cost area is a substantial evaluation factor; however, it is less important than each of the technical and management areas.  <br>	<br>THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR AWARD AND FUND ALL, SOME, OR NONE OF THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED UNDER THIS BAA.<br><br>9.	 Other Information<br><br>a.	The Government anticipates making multiple awards. Issuance of the BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs.  Offerors will be notified of selection for award approximately 90 days after Government receipt of the proposals.  The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received.  Proposals not selected for immediate funding may be considered for a period of 6 months.<br>b.	 In an effort to expedite evaluation of proposals, upon official notification of selection for negotiation and contract award, the following information shall be provided:<br><br>(1)	Indirect rate forecast/budget (detailed by cost element in the pool and base).<br>(2)	Historical indirect rate information, for both prime and subcontractors, for  <br> the previous three years; include a breakdown of the base and expense/pools for each of the indirect rates proposed<br>(3)	A consolidated, priced Bill of Material<br>(4)	Order of preference for data submission:<br>o	audited incurred cost rates<br>o	actual rates submitted to DCAA but not audited (from incurred cost submission)<br>o	actual rates not submitted to DCAA<br>o	payroll data from accounting system (not just a listing of rates) related to proposed base labor rates<br><br>c.	The Government contemplates award of cost, cost-plus-fixed-fee, or cost sharing types of contracts under this BAA. Proposals based on a type of contract other than that contemplated will be considered, but offerors are advised that the Government is under no obligation to accept same. <br>d.	The Government anticipates that any contract resulting from this BAA will be funded on an incremental basis as provided by FAR 52.232-22, "Limitation of Funds."<br>e.	Any necessary coordination of facility use will be performed by the offeror.  <br>f.	Any requests by offerors for Government furnished property, test equipment, material, or information must be clearly identified in the proposal. The Government, however, is under no obligation to comply with such requests. Therefore, offerors should make provision for alternate technical approaches in the event the Government is unwilling to provide the property requested. The Government will not entertain requests for general office equipment, and/or office supplies.  <br>g.	Unless specifically identified under the BAA initiative proposal, all work to be performed under any resultant contract will be unclassified and will not involve access to classified information. <br>h.	Central Contractor Registration: <br>Offerors are required to register in the DOD Central Contractor Registration database prior to award of any contract (DFAR 252.204-7004). Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227- 2423 or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Award cannot be made to a firm not registered in CCR. <br>i.	Reports and Program Reviews:<br>(1)	As a minimum, all contractors will be required to submit monthly financial and technical status reports and a final technical report. Depending on the duration of the program, offerors may be required to prepare semiannual and/or annual interim reports. The Government negotiator will work out an appropriate Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) with each successful contractor unless a CDRL is not appropriate. <br>(2)	Depending on the nature of the research program and the duration of same, the Government may require that the contractor attend program reviews at SMDC or within CONUS. In addition to these formal program reviews, informal reviews may be scheduled as deemed necessary by cognizant technical personnel. Requirements for program reviews will be determined when proposals are selected for award. <br>(3)	Monthly expenditure plan and disbursement rate reports are required and may be included in the financial report. The disbursement report must include the forecast of billings to the Government and the total cumulative amounts billed through the report month. <br>(4)	The number and types of reports will be specified in the award document. However, the following are the titles, data item description (DID) numbers, and frequency of data items anticipated, at a minimum, to be delivered during contract performance:<br><br>(a)	STATUS REPORT, DI-MGMT-80368A, Submission: Monthly	<br>(b)	FUNDS AND MAN-HOUR EXPENDITURE REPORT DI-FNCL -80331A, Submission: monthly<br>(c)	TECHNICAL REPORT - STUDY/SERVICES DI-MISC-80508B, FINAL REPORT Submission: At the end of each contract performance period<br>(d)	OPERATIONAL SECURITY (OPSEC) PLAN, DI-MISC-80508B, Submission:  One-time (as required)<br>(e)	COMPUTER SOFTWARE PRODUCT END ITEMS DI-MCCR-80700, Submission:  (as required)<br>(f)	SOFTWARE USER MANUAL (SUM) DI-IPSC-81443A, Submission:  One-time (as required)<br>(g)	SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PLAN DI-IPSC-81427A, Submission: One-time (as required)<br>(h)	SOFTWARE PRODUCT SPECIFICATION DI-IPSC-81441A, Submission:  One-time (as required)<br>(i)	TEST PLAN, DI-NDTI-80566A, Submission:  (as required)<br>(j)	BRIEFING MATERIAL DI-MGMT-81605, Submission:  (as required)<br>(k)	RECORD OF MEETING/MINUTES REPORTS DI-MGMT-81605, Submission:  (as required)<br>(l)	TECHNICAL REPORT - STUDY SERVICES DI-MGMT-80508B, TECHNICAL MEMORANDA Submission:  (as required)<br><br>j.	Security Requirements:  While non-classified work is relevant, research at SMDC often leads to military applications and development or use of data that can be classified.  This cannot always be anticipated in advance, and when applicable the applicant must be prepared to handle classified information.  Possession of a SECRET facility clearance is recommended.  Additionally, non-U.S. citizen access to information under the cognizance of USASMDC/ARSTRAT must be approved by the USASMDC/ARSTRAT Foreign Disclosure Officer.  Requests for non-U.S. citizen access should be submitted to the Contracting Officer using SMDC Form 380-10c.<br>k.	Research and Technology Protection:  In the event a contract is awarded, the contractor shall assist the Government in the identification of any inherited and new Critical Program Information (CPI).  The contractor shall implement security measures, as directed by the Government, for any identified CPI to prevent unauthorized disclosure.  CPI, as defined in DoD Instruction 5200.39, are "elements or components of an RDA program that, if compromised, could cause significant degradation in mission effectiveness; shorten the expected combat-effective life of the system; reduce technological advantage; significantly alter program direction; or enable an adversary to defeat, counter, copy, or reverse engineer the technology or capability."  The contractor will be subject to internal and external audits of the implementation of security measures for handling CPI and will provide audit results to SMDC upon request.<br><br>l.	Any effort awarded as a result of this BAA must use SI (metric) units exclusively.<br>m.	  The reports that are delivered in connection with awards under the Technical Center BAA may be made available to subsequent Technical Center acquisitions, subject to applicable data rights.  <br><br>10.

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

<p>THE FOLLOWING FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (FAR) AND HOMELAND SECURITY ACQUISITION REGULATION (HSAR) PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES APPLY:<br />52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (FEB 2012)</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />Evaluation Factors: The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose proposal is identified as offering the best value solution. The best value for the Coast Guard may merit a higher price based on technical superiority. Using sound business judgment, the government will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal's relative capability as measured against the below evaluation factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical<br />Factor 2 - Past Performance<br />Factor 3 - Price</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Award will be made utilizing the factors listed below, in descending order of importance. The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose proposal is identified as offering the best value solution.<br />Factor 1 - Technical<br />Contractor's submitted detailed work package and performance plan. <br />Contractor demonstrating possession of or ability to obtain (via an official agreement) the required OEM manuals<br />Contractor facility<br />Quality System<br />Aircraft engine repair capabilities and experience<br />Factor 2 - Past Performance<br />Contractor's customer ratings, including quality ratings, customer service, warranty, recommendation for future service and performance.<br />Factor 3 - Price<br />The Coast Guard may determine the best value which merits a higher price based on technical superiority. The Coast Guard, using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal's relative capability as measured against the evaluation factors.<br />Factors 1 and 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3. While the Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Price Factors are significantly more important than the Price factor. Price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical factors approach equal. <br />52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (FEB 1998) <br />This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

<p>COCO Alert 08-33 Attachment 1, Notice for Filing Agency Protests, is included with this solicitation.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The factors are listed in order of descending importance.  Please see rating chart for evaluation standards.<br><br>1.	TECHNICAL CAPABILITY/RISK RATING:<br><br>SUBFACTOR A: The proposal provided adequate evidence of contractor's ability to meet critical -85 minimum signal strength as shown on map and Non-Critical areas a minimum signal strength of -95 as shown on map.<br><br>SUBFACTOR B:	Availability of coverage for both the Continental United States and International locations was indicated in the proposal and meet the requirements. <br><br>Proposed devices operate at no less than the latest technology of 3G or better and meet minimum Army requirements. Proposal displayed ability to meet Army standards as listed in the Scope of Work.<br><br>SUBFACTOR C: 	Proposed Blackberry devices are capable of operating with a Common Access Card (CAC) reader connected.<br><br>Devices are compatible with sync operations within a Windows 7 Operating System and are forward compatible with new Operating Systems as the Army changes.<br><br>		SUBFACTOR D:	 Offerors Wi-Fi devices are compatible with current Army Virtual Private Network (VPN) enabled laptops and support no less than 4 users simultaneously at a minimum of 3G or upgraded to current technology at no cost to the Government.<br><br>	SUBFACTOR E: Administrative approach. Contractor's plan to submit invoices in 			     Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) or other electronic submission <br>     method is considered feasible for streamlining and simplifying <br>     the payment process. The contractor proposes the ability to <br>     allow designated Government representatives to access their     <br>     website in order to make administrative changes to devices  <br>     which include but are not limited to: device activation and <br>     deactivation; changes to user names; voicemail password reset;  <br>     etc. Offeror proposes other customer service alternatives which<br>     provide easier account access and trouble-free administration of     <br>     account. <br><br>2.      PAST PERFORMANCE/PERFORMANCE RATING<br><br>SUBFACTOR A: All contractors are required to provide references of contracts where they have provided equipment similar to the requirements of this solicitation within the past three years.<br><br>SUBFACTOR B:  Each contractor will be evaluated on their performance under existing or prior contracts for similar equipment.  Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which contractor's relative ranking will be compared to assure best value to the Government.  The Government will focus on information to include performance risk that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  The Government may contact references other than those identified by the contractor and the information received used in the evaluation of the contractor's past performances.<br><br>SUFACTOR C:  In providing references the contractor shall identify the following:  Company or Organization name, point of contact, telephone number, fax number, email address, contract number and project title.  Contractors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing thorough and complete past performance information rests with the contractor.<br><br>3.       PRICE:  <br><br>The Department of Defense is committed to apply Best Value contracting as a means to select the overall best performers for timely delivery of quality products, while reducing the Governments' administrative costs associated with contractor oversight.  The Government is evaluating factors in addition to pricing under this solicitation and such, may award a contract for more than the lowest priced offer.<br><br>The Army will perform a price analysis in accordance with FAR 15.805-2 as supplemented to determine the reasonableness of each contractor's proposed price for the project.  Competing contractors who propose reasonable prices will be compared to one another on the basis of their prices to establish the relative competitiveness of those prices.  In addition to the reasonable/competitive analysis, and as a part of the greatest value determination, the evaluation of the contractor's cost or price proposal and degree of its importance will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factors on which selection is to be made. Thus, contractors are hereby notified that although price is not expected to be the controlling factor in the selection of a contractor for this solicitation, the degree of importance of price as a factor could become greater depending on the equality of the proposals for other factors evaluated; where competing proposals are determined to be substantially equal, total price and other price considerations would become the controlling factor. Option will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2.<br><br><br>FACTORS INFORMATION<br><br>Factor 1 (Technical Capability/Risk Rating), Factor 2 (Past Performance/Risk Rating) and Factor 3 (Price) are factors that will be evaluated.  All sub-factors within Factor 1 are major sub-factors.  If the proposal does not provide adequate evidence that these requirements will be met, the proposal will be determined to be technically unacceptable.  Price is highly significant in that the Government will not award a contract where price will exceed available program funding. The proposer should be aware that the Government considers technical approach/risk rating and past performance/performance risk of higher importance than price, and will not accept items of generally lower quality to gain a minor advantage in price.  If two or more proposals are rated of equal merit, price will determine their final ranking order.<br>	<br><br>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 <br>PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:<br>1.	TECHNICAL CAPABILITY/RISK RATING:<br><br>SUBFACTOR A:	The contractor shall make available upon request the results of    site testing that will show numeric signal strengths recorded and allow verification of the stated signal strengths.<br><br>SUBFACTOR B:	The contractor shall make available maps of coverage for both the Continental United States and International locations.  These maps should also include the types and locations of coverage (i.e. 3G or 4G)<br><br>SUBFACTOR C:	The contractor shall make available a list of Army approved Blackberry devices with the capability of Common Access Card (CAC) functionality and that are compatible with Windows 7 Operating system or greater.<br><br>SUBFACTOR D:	The contractor will make available a list of Army approved Wi-Fi devices that are capable of supporting no less than 4 users with Army Virtual Private Network (VPN) enabled laptops.<br><br>SUBFACTOR E: 	Offeror shall provide administrative plan to include proposed invoicing, customer service and any other administrative approach relevant to support administrative plan. <br><br>2.

The rating for the Technical factor and subfactors will be expressed as an adjectival assessment of Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable or Unacceptable.<br><br>	2.  Technical Capability/Risk Rating Sub-Factor Rating Definitions.   The following rating definitions will be utilized in the evaluation of the Technical Sub-factors (the Technical factor will be a "roll-up" of the Technical sub-factor ratings):<br><br>Combined Technical/Risk Ratings<br>Rating	Description<br>Outstanding	Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional<br>approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths<br>far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful<br>performance is very low.<br>Good	Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough<br>approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal<br>contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of<br>unsuccessful performance is low.<br>Acceptable	Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate<br>approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths<br>and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact<br>on contract performance.

In no event will a failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after award of the contract.<br>GOVERNMENT INSPECTION / ACCEPTANCE: at Destination  <br>CLAUSES: FAR 52.212-1, 52.212-2, 52.212-3Alt I, 52.212-4, 52.212-5 (to include 52.204-10, 52.209-6, 52.219-28, 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-36, 52.223-18, 52.225-13, 52.232-33), 52.217-9, DFARS 252.212-7001 (to include 252.203-7000, 252.232-7003, 252.247-7023), 252.203-7002, 252.204-7003, 252.209-7999, 252.211-7003, 252.232-7010, AMCAC 52.233-4052. <br>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2  <br>EVALUATION FACTORS: <br>PROPOSED EVALUATION FACTORS, SUBFACTORS, AND<br>	ASSOCIATED EVALUATION STANDARDS<br><br>The following factors and sub-factors are proposed for this solicitation.  The factors are listed in order of descending importance.  Please see rating chart for evaluation standards.<br><br>1.	TECHNICAL CAPABILITY/RISK RATING:<br><br>SUBFACTOR A: The proposal provided adequate evidence of contractor's ability to meet critical -85 minimum signal strength as shown on map and Non-Critical areas a minimum signal strength of -95 as shown on map.<br><br>SUBFACTOR B:	Availability of coverage for both the Continental United States and International locations was indicated in the proposal and meet the requirements. <br><br>Proposed devices operate at no less than the latest technology of 3G or better and meet minimum Army requirements. Proposal displayed ability to meet Army standards as listed in the Scope of Work.<br><br>SUBFACTOR C: 	Proposed Blackberry devices are capable of operating with a Common Access Card (CAC) reader connected.<br><br>Devices are compatible with sync operations within a Windows 7 Operating System and are forward compatible with new Operating Systems as the Army changes.<br><br>		SUBFACTOR D:	 Offerors Wi-Fi devices are compatible with current Army Virtual Private Network (VPN) enabled laptops and support no less than 4 users simultaneously at a minimum of 3G or upgraded to current technology at no cost to the Government.<br><br>	SUBFACTOR E: Administrative approach. Contractor's plan to submit invoices in 			     Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) or other electronic submission <br>     method is considered feasible for streamlining and simplifying <br>     the payment process. The contractor proposes the ability to <br>     allow designated Government representatives to access their     <br>     website in order to make administrative changes to devices  <br>     which include but are not limited to: device activation and <br>     deactivation; changes to user names; voicemail password reset;  <br>     etc. Offeror proposes other customer service alternatives which<br>     provide easier account access and trouble-free administration of     <br>     account. <br><br>2.      PAST PERFORMANCE/PERFORMANCE RATING<br><br>SUBFACTOR A: All contractors are required to provide references of contracts where they have provided equipment similar to the requirements of this solicitation within the past three years.<br><br>SUBFACTOR B:  Each contractor will be evaluated on their performance under existing or prior contracts for similar equipment.  Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which contractor's relative ranking will be compared to assure best value to the Government.  The Government will focus on information to include performance risk that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  The Government may contact references other than those identified by the contractor and the information received used in the evaluation of the contractor's past performances.<br><br>SUFACTOR C:  In providing references the contractor shall identify the following:  Company or Organization name, point of contact, telephone number, fax number, email address, contract number and project title.  Contractors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing thorough and complete past performance information rests with the contractor.<br><br>3.       PRICE:  <br><br>The Department of Defense is committed to apply Best Value contracting as a means to select the overall best performers for timely delivery of quality products, while reducing the Governments' administrative costs associated with contractor oversight.  The Government is evaluating factors in addition to pricing under this solicitation and such, may award a contract for more than the lowest priced offer.<br><br>The Army will perform a price analysis in accordance with FAR 15.805-2 as supplemented to determine the reasonableness of each contractor's proposed price for the project.  Competing contractors who propose reasonable prices will be compared to one another on the basis of their prices to establish the relative competitiveness of those prices.  In addition to the reasonable/competitive analysis, and as a part of the greatest value determination, the evaluation of the contractor's cost or price proposal and degree of its importance will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factors on which selection is to be made. Thus, contractors are hereby notified that although price is not expected to be the controlling factor in the selection of a contractor for this solicitation, the degree of importance of price as a factor could become greater depending on the equality of the proposals for other factors evaluated; where competing proposals are determined to be substantially equal, total price and other price considerations would become the controlling factor. Option will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2.<br><br><br>FACTORS INFORMATION<br><br>Factor 1 (Technical Capability/Risk Rating), Factor 2 (Past Performance/Risk Rating) and Factor 3 (Price) are factors that will be evaluated.  All sub-factors within Factor 1 are major sub-factors.  If the proposal does not provide adequate evidence that these requirements will be met, the proposal will be determined to be technically unacceptable.  Price is highly significant in that the Government will not award a contract where price will exceed available program funding. The proposer should be aware that the Government considers technical approach/risk rating and past performance/performance risk of higher importance than price, and will not accept items of generally lower quality to gain a minor advantage in price.  If two or more proposals are rated of equal merit, price will determine their final ranking order.<br>	<br><br>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 <br>PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:<br>1.	TECHNICAL CAPABILITY/RISK RATING:<br><br>SUBFACTOR A:	The contractor shall make available upon request the results of    site testing that will show numeric signal strengths recorded and allow verification of the stated signal strengths.<br><br>SUBFACTOR B:	The contractor shall make available maps of coverage for both the Continental United States and International locations.  These maps should also include the types and locations of coverage (i.e. 3G or 4G)<br><br>SUBFACTOR C:	The contractor shall make available a list of Army approved Blackberry devices with the capability of Common Access Card (CAC) functionality and that are compatible with Windows 7 Operating system or greater.<br><br>SUBFACTOR D:	The contractor will make available a list of Army approved Wi-Fi devices that are capable of supporting no less than 4 users with Army Virtual Private Network (VPN) enabled laptops.<br><br>SUBFACTOR E: 	Offeror shall provide administrative plan to include proposed invoicing, customer service and any other administrative approach relevant to support administrative plan. <br><br>2. PAST PERFORMANCE/PERFORMANCE RATING<br><br>Contractor is responsible for providing adequate information to show that their past performance is recent and relevant.

The rating for the Technical factor and subfactors will be expressed as an adjectival assessment of Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable or Unacceptable.<br><br>	2.  Technical Capability/Risk Rating Sub-Factor Rating Definitions.   The following rating definitions will be utilized in the evaluation of the Technical Sub-factors (the Technical factor will be a "roll-up" of the Technical sub-factor ratings):<br><br>Combined Technical/Risk Ratings<br>Rating	Description<br>Outstanding	Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional<br>approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths<br>far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful<br>performance is very low.<br>Good	Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough<br>approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal<br>contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of<br>unsuccessful performance is low.<br>Acceptable	Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate<br>approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths<br>and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact<br>on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance<br>is no worse than moderate.<br>Marginal	Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not<br>demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal has one or more weaknesses<br>which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful<br>performance is high.<br>Unacceptable	Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or<br>more deficiencies. Proposal is unawardable.<br><br><br> <br>	3.  Performance Risk.  Past Performance Relevancy Rating and Performance Confidence Assessments will be assigned to the Performance Risk.

Price. No adjectival ratings are necessary for price evaluations since price is not rated. A risk factor associated with the contractor's ability to perform at the proposed price may be used.<br><br>Deficiency.  A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a <br>combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.<br><br>Strength.  Any aspect of a proposal when judged against a stated evaluation criterion enhances the merit of the proposal or increases the probability of successful performance of the contract.<br><br>Significant Strength.

<DESC><br>The following question was posed:<br><br>"Is it acceptable to fold the blades before towing into the hangar to perform the mod and leaving them folded until the mod is complete?"<br><br>The answer to this question is NO.  When the blades are folded, all of the weight of the blades rest on the tail boom.  Because the tail section will be cut into, the extra blade weight would cause undue pressure on the section being modified.  The Aviation Engineering Directorate does not allow any work in or on the tail boom during this modification.<br>

<p>To aid in the evaluation process, proposals shall be clearly and concisely written as well as neat, indexed and cross indexed, and logically assembled. Format requirements and page limitations are established to facilitate ease of evaluation and to assist in determining whether Offerors are able to concisely communicate a clear understanding of the requirement and their proposed approach and capabilities. Prospective Offerors are asked to bear in mind that all material submitted should be directly pertinent to the requirements of this solicitation and that extraneous promotional material or brochures shall not be submitted, nor will be evaluated. All pages of each volume shall be appropriately numbered (i.e., "Page 1 of 10," etc.), and identified with the name of the Offeror, the date, and the solicitation number.</p>
<p>Offerors shall furnish the proposal in two separate volumes as follows:</p>
<p>VOLUME 1 - TECHNICAL:</p>
<p>The Offeror's technical submission should demonstrate the firm's capability to perform the requirements outlined in the RFP. Offerors shall provide a technical proposal that addresses the following four (4) evaluation factors:</p>
<p>(1) Experience - The contractor must have;</p>
<p>&bull; at least 8 years of experience working in research and public policy with law enforcement communities;<br />&bull; direct and lead experience in researching and designing a case study and lessons learned report of a multi-jurisdictional, law enforcement investigation/incident;<br />&bull; demonstrated experience conducting studies and assessments of highly sensitive and confrontational law enforcement situations;<br />&bull; demonstrated experience in producing documents that have been used by law enforcement administrators to modify agency practices.<br />&bull; demonstrated experience facilitating meetings with law enforcement personnel and government, executive level (Senior Executive Service) personnel.<br />&bull; demonstrated experience conducting course design workshops with subject matter experts, resulting in the design of a course lesson plan consisting of case studies and interactive exercises.</p>
<p>(2) Past Performance - Past performance may cite federal, state, local government, commercial sources, or not for profit sources, and should highlight the company's key role in the past performance being documented. This information shall consist of a one (1) page introductory matrix listing the offerors' and its critical subcontractors' past performance references. The offeror shall provide a minimum of three (3) references. In addition, the offeror may submit a minimum of three (3) references for subcontractors who are expected to perform aspects of this effort that the offeror considers critical to overall successful performance. The offeror should include rationale supporting the assertion of relevance for each reference. These references should also be from different contracts. To be considered, past performance data may not be older than three (3) years (normally 3, but could vary based on the industry) from the date of the proposal, and may include active contracts; if over one year old. Further, offerors should include a list of all relevant ATF on-going contracts or contracts completed for the specified period.</p>
<p>Past performance references shall be as a prime contractor or first-tier subcontractor on previous or current projects/tasks that are similar in size, scope, and complexity to the work identified in the SOW. Past performance does not necessarily have to be Government-related; but it is important to demonstrate and provide evidence of past performance for work similar in size, scope and complexity to that described in the RFP. The offeror is required to clearly demonstrate management actions implemented to overcome problems and the effects of those actions, in terms of improvements achieved or problems solved.</p>
<p>Offerors shall forward the attached Past Performance Questionnaire (Attachment D), to offeror's references. The references shall forward their completed questionnaires to the Contracting Officer, NOT BACK TO THE OFFEROR. The questionnaires shall be delivered via email directly from the offeror's references to Frankie.Murphy@atf.gov or faxed to (202)648-9654.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to use publicly available reports and data from the Contractor Performance System (CPS), Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) found on the web at http://www.PPIRS. The Government may also use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources, not just those contracts identified by offerors. For each reference, provide:</p>
<p>a. Reference Name (Company or Entity)<br />b. Program Title<br />c. Contracting Agency/Private Company<br />d. Contract Number/Task Order Number (if applicable)<br />e. Brief description of the contract effort, including results and successes<br />f. Type of Contract<br />g. Period of Performance<br />h. Original contract dollar value and current or actual dollar value<br />i. Actual completion date<br />j. Contact names, addresses, telephone numbers, Fax numbers and e-mail addresses of current, or last (if contract completed) Program Director/Manager and/or Contract Manager.</p>
<p>(3) Technical/Management Approach - The Offeror must define a technical and management approach that demonstrates a clear understanding of the SOW and its requirements. The Offeror's technical/management approach should include the following: 1) discussion of the background, objectives, and work requirements of the SOW; 2) discussion of proposed methods and techniques for completing and managing each task in a timely manner; 3) discussion which supports how each task will be managed by the Offeror's perspective; 4) discussion of any anticipated major difficulties and problem areas, along with potential recommended approaches for their resolution; 5) discussion of major logistical considerations and; 6) The Offeror's labor mix required to conduct the tasks and produce any deliverables must be identified.</p>
<p>(4) Key Personnel (Project Manager, Researcher, Curriculum Developer &amp; Facilitator) - The Offeror must ensure the proposed personnel skill levels, area of expertise, education, capability, availability and experience are adequate to perform the work required by the SOW. Therefore, a resume is required.</p>
<p>- Resume shall be submitted with quotation for proposed Project Manager. Resume shall include a description of the experience and capability of proposed personnel. Descriptions shall address such items as the individual's background, education, work experience and accomplishments; showing the knowledge that the individual has gained through completed and ongoing efforts that are similar in nature to this effort. Resume should not be longer than two (2) pages.</p>
<p>Page Limitation: The technical proposal submission shall be limited to eight (8) one-sided pages, excluding the resume(s), past performance reference information and any cover letter/title pages. OFFERORS ARE CAUTIONED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL ONLY EVALUATE THE FIRST EIGHT (8) PAGES OF ANY TECHNICAL PROPOSAL THAT EXCEEDS THE PAGE LIMITATION. Please do not attach any additional information as an Appendix.</p>
<p>Proposal shall be prepared in Times New Roman font, 12-point font, single line spacing, 1-inch margins, and 8-1/2 x 11 inch paper. Tables, figures and graphs may use Arial, 10 point font, single-spaced.</p>
<p>In order for the technical proposal to be evaluated strictly on the merit of the material submitted, NO COST/PRICE INFORMATION IS TO BE INCLUDED IN VOLUME I. The evaluation and award procedures in FAR 15.305 will be applied to this acquisition. The information submitted as Volume I will be evaluated on the information presented; therefore, organization, clarity, accuracy of information, relevance, and completeness are of prime importance.</p>
<p>VOLUME II - COST/PRICE (non rated)</p>
<p>Volume II shall consist of complete breakdown of proposed price; with files formatted in Microsoft Office. In addition to completing and returning the attached price schedule, the offeror must also provide a complete price breakdown of the quotation, which explains the development of the proposed costs (including labor categories, number of hours, corresponding fully loaded labor rates and any other direct costs). The proposed labor skill mix associated with the proposed labor rates will be analyzed to determine if the prices proposed are reasonable, for the type of work proposed. There is no page limit on price volume.</p>
<p>Pricing spreadsheets that are submitted in a very small font size and are not reasonably legible may be considered as unacceptable and grounds for exclusion from further consideration.<br />(ix) 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a Firm Fixed Price/Cost Reimbursable (travel) contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors (listed in descending order or relative importance) shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) Experience - The degree to which to Offeror's experience demonstrates a thorough<br />working knowledge of successfully providing the required course design, development, <br />instruction and assessment.<br /><br />(2) Past Performance - The offerors' proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which<br />their performance demonstrates the likelihood of successful performance in providing requirements <br />similar in size, scope and complexity of this solicitation. The Government may choose to evaluate<br />publicly available reports, and/or data from the PPIRS. The Government may use present and/or past <br />performance data obtained from a variety of sources, not just those contracts identified by offeror. The <br />information gathered for past performance may also be used in the responsibility determination.</p>
<p><br />(3) Technical/Management Approach - The degree to which the Offeror effectively demonstrates a <br />knowledge, understanding, technical ability to successfully perform and manage the requirements of the SOW in an efficient and timely manner; as the proposed period of performance contained in the offeror's proposal will be evaluated for realism and achievability. Additionally, the appropriateness, soundness and reasonableness of the Offeror's problem resolution, logistic considerations, corporate commitment to achieve the overall project objectives and methodology for providing resource support will be assessed.</p>
<p>(4) Key Personnel - The degree to which the Offeror's proposed key personnel's (Project Manager,<br />Researcher, Curriculum Developer and Facilitator) resume demonstrates the individual's ability to<br />execute SOW requirements on the basis of strength of relevant education and training, depth and <br />breadth of relevant experience.</p>
<p>(5) Price - (non-rated) - Price will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b), Price analysis <br />commercial and non-commercial items.</p>
<p>Factors 1-4 are referred to as technical factors. Factors 1-4 are in descending order of relative importance (Factor 1 is more important than 2, Factor 2 is more important than 3 and Factor 3 is more important than 4). Factors 1-4 (when combined) are significantly more important than Factor 4, Price, which is not rated.</p>
<p>As the technical proposals approach equality, price will become more important in making the award determination. In the event that two or more proposals are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent), the Government will make an assessment through a trade-off analysis and other analytic means that involve the evaluation of superior technical capability versus the added cost. Based on Best Value, award may be made to the lower priced quotation. It should be noted that award may be made to other than the lowest priced quotation if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quotation, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted.</p>
<p>Award may also be made on the basis of initial quotations without discussions (although the right to conduct discussions, if necessary, is reserved). Offerors are therefore cautioned that each initial quotation should contain the Offeror's best terms.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). NOT APPLICABLE TO THIS REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(x) 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Mar 2012). Offerors shall provide representations and certifications (FAR 52.212-3) electronically via the BPN website (www.bpn.gov/orca). A copy of the on-line representations and certifications submission shall be included in the offeror's response.</p>
<p>(xi) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Mar 2012), applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xii) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (Mar 2012), applies to this acquisition. In addition, the following clauses are also incorporated by reference to implement provisions of law or executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)</p>
<p>52.217-8, Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999): The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within the current period of performance. (End of clause)</p>

Prospective Offerors are asked to bear in mind that all material submitted should be directly pertinent to the requirements of this solicitation and that extraneous promotional material or brochures shall not be submitted, nor will be evaluated. All pages of each volume shall be appropriately numbered (i.e., "Page 1 of 10," etc.), and identified with the name of the Offeror, the date, and the solicitation number.</p>
<p>Offerors shall furnish the proposal in two separate volumes as follows:</p>
<p>VOLUME 1 - TECHNICAL:</p>
<p>The Offeror's technical submission should demonstrate the firm's capability to perform the requirements outlined in the RFP. Offerors shall provide a technical proposal that addresses the following four (4) evaluation factors:</p>
<p>(1) Experience - The contractor must have;</p>
<p>&bull; at least 8 years of experience working in research and public policy with law enforcement communities;<br />&bull; direct and lead experience in researching and designing a case study and lessons learned report of a multi-jurisdictional, law enforcement investigation/incident;<br />&bull; demonstrated experience conducting studies and assessments of highly sensitive and confrontational law enforcement situations;<br />&bull; demonstrated experience in producing documents that have been used by law enforcement administrators to modify agency practices.<br />&bull; demonstrated experience facilitating meetings with law enforcement personnel and government, executive level (Senior Executive Service) personnel.<br />&bull; demonstrated experience conducting course design workshops with subject matter experts, resulting in the design of a course lesson plan consisting of case studies and interactive exercises.</p>
<p>(2) Past Performance - Past performance may cite federal, state, local government, commercial sources, or not for profit sources, and should highlight the company's key role in the past performance being documented. This information shall consist of a one (1) page introductory matrix listing the offerors' and its critical subcontractors' past performance references. The offeror shall provide a minimum of three (3) references. In addition, the offeror may submit a minimum of three (3) references for subcontractors who are expected to perform aspects of this effort that the offeror considers critical to overall successful performance. The offeror should include rationale supporting the assertion of relevance for each reference. These references should also be from different contracts. To be considered, past performance data may not be older than three (3) years (normally 3, but could vary based on the industry) from the date of the proposal, and may include active contracts; if over one year old. Further, offerors should include a list of all relevant ATF on-going contracts or contracts completed for the specified period.</p>
<p>Past performance references shall be as a prime contractor or first-tier subcontractor on previous or current projects/tasks that are similar in size, scope, and complexity to the work identified in the SOW. Past performance does not necessarily have to be Government-related; but it is important to demonstrate and provide evidence of past performance for work similar in size, scope and complexity to that described in the RFP. The offeror is required to clearly demonstrate management actions implemented to overcome problems and the effects of those actions, in terms of improvements achieved or problems solved.</p>
<p>Offerors shall forward the attached Past Performance Questionnaire (Attachment D), to offeror's references. The references shall forward their completed questionnaires to the Contracting Officer, NOT BACK TO THE OFFEROR. The questionnaires shall be delivered via email directly from the offeror's references to Frankie.Murphy@atf.gov or faxed to (202)648-9654.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to use publicly available reports and data from the Contractor Performance System (CPS), Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) found on the web at http://www.PPIRS. The Government may also use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources, not just those contracts identified by offerors. For each reference, provide:</p>
<p>a. Reference Name (Company or Entity)<br />b. Program Title<br />c. Contracting Agency/Private Company<br />d. Contract Number/Task Order Number (if applicable)<br />e. Brief description of the contract effort, including results and successes<br />f. Type of Contract<br />g. Period of Performance<br />h. Original contract dollar value and current or actual dollar value<br />i. Actual completion date<br />j. Contact names, addresses, telephone numbers, Fax numbers and e-mail addresses of current, or last (if contract completed) Program Director/Manager and/or Contract Manager.</p>
<p>(3) Technical/Management Approach - The Offeror must define a technical and management approach that demonstrates a clear understanding of the SOW and its requirements. The Offeror's technical/management approach should include the following: 1) discussion of the background, objectives, and work requirements of the SOW; 2) discussion of proposed methods and techniques for completing and managing each task in a timely manner; 3) discussion which supports how each task will be managed by the Offeror's perspective; 4) discussion of any anticipated major difficulties and problem areas, along with potential recommended approaches for their resolution; 5) discussion of major logistical considerations and; 6) The Offeror's labor mix required to conduct the tasks and produce any deliverables must be identified.</p>
<p>(4) Key Personnel (Project Manager, Researcher, Curriculum Developer &amp; Facilitator) - The Offeror must ensure the proposed personnel skill levels, area of expertise, education, capability, availability and experience are adequate to perform the work required by the SOW. Therefore, a resume is required.</p>
<p>- Resume shall be submitted with quotation for proposed Project Manager. Resume shall include a description of the experience and capability of proposed personnel. Descriptions shall address such items as the individual's background, education, work experience and accomplishments; showing the knowledge that the individual has gained through completed and ongoing efforts that are similar in nature to this effort. Resume should not be longer than two (2) pages.</p>
<p>Page Limitation: The technical proposal submission shall be limited to eight (8) one-sided pages, excluding the resume(s), past performance reference information and any cover letter/title pages. OFFERORS ARE CAUTIONED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL ONLY EVALUATE THE FIRST EIGHT (8) PAGES OF ANY TECHNICAL PROPOSAL THAT EXCEEDS THE PAGE LIMITATION. Please do not attach any additional information as an Appendix.</p>
<p>Proposal shall be prepared in Times New Roman font, 12-point font, single line spacing, 1-inch margins, and 8-1/2 x 11 inch paper. Tables, figures and graphs may use Arial, 10 point font, single-spaced.</p>
<p>In order for the technical proposal to be evaluated strictly on the merit of the material submitted, NO COST/PRICE INFORMATION IS TO BE INCLUDED IN VOLUME I. The evaluation and award procedures in FAR 15.305 will be applied to this acquisition. The information submitted as Volume I will be evaluated on the information presented; therefore, organization, clarity, accuracy of information, relevance, and completeness are of prime importance.</p>
<p>VOLUME II - COST/PRICE (non rated)</p>
<p>Volume II shall consist of complete breakdown of proposed price; with files formatted in Microsoft Office. In addition to completing and returning the attached price schedule, the offeror must also provide a complete price breakdown of the quotation, which explains the development of the proposed costs (including labor categories, number of hours, corresponding fully loaded labor rates and any other direct costs). The proposed labor skill mix associated with the proposed labor rates will be analyzed to determine if the prices proposed are reasonable, for the type of work proposed. There is no page limit on price volume.</p>
<p>Pricing spreadsheets that are submitted in a very small font size and are not reasonably legible may be considered as unacceptable and grounds for exclusion from further consideration.<br />(ix) 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a Firm Fixed Price/Cost Reimbursable (travel) contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors (listed in descending order or relative importance) shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) Experience - The degree to which to Offeror's experience demonstrates a thorough<br />working knowledge of successfully providing the required course design, development, <br />instruction and assessment.<br /><br />(2) Past Performance - The offerors' proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which<br />their performance demonstrates the likelihood of successful performance in providing requirements <br />similar in size, scope and complexity of this solicitation. The Government may choose to evaluate<br />publicly available reports, and/or data from the PPIRS. The Government may use present and/or past <br />performance data obtained from a variety of sources, not just those contracts identified by offeror. The <br />information gathered for past performance may also be used in the responsibility determination.</p>
<p><br />(3) Technical/Management Approach - The degree to which the Offeror effectively demonstrates a <br />knowledge, understanding, technical ability to successfully perform and manage the requirements of the SOW in an efficient and timely manner; as the proposed period of performance contained in the offeror's proposal will be evaluated for realism and achievability. Additionally, the appropriateness, soundness and reasonableness of the Offeror's problem resolution, logistic considerations, corporate commitment to achieve the overall project objectives and methodology for providing resource support will be assessed.</p>
<p>(4) Key Personnel - The degree to which the Offeror's proposed key personnel's (Project Manager,<br />Researcher, Curriculum Developer and Facilitator) resume demonstrates the individual's ability to<br />execute SOW requirements on the basis of strength of relevant education and training, depth and <br />breadth of relevant experience.</p>
<p>(5) Price - (non-rated) - Price will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b), Price analysis <br />commercial and non-commercial items.</p>
<p>Factors 1-4 are referred to as technical factors. Factors 1-4 are in descending order of relative importance (Factor 1 is more important than 2, Factor 2 is more important than 3 and Factor 3 is more important than 4). Factors 1-4 (when combined) are significantly more important than Factor 4, Price, which is not rated.</p>
<p>As the technical proposals approach equality, price will become more important in making the award determination. In the event that two or more proposals are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent), the Government will make an assessment through a trade-off analysis and other analytic means that involve the evaluation of superior technical capability versus the added cost. Based on Best Value, award may be made to the lower priced quotation. It should be noted that award may be made to other than the lowest priced quotation if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quotation, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted.</p>
<p>Award may also be made on the basis of initial quotations without discussions (although the right to conduct discussions, if necessary, is reserved). Offerors are therefore cautioned that each initial quotation should contain the Offeror's best terms.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). NOT APPLICABLE TO THIS REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(x) 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Mar 2012). Offerors shall provide representations and certifications (FAR 52.212-3) electronically via the BPN website (www.bpn.gov/orca). A copy of the on-line representations and certifications submission shall be included in the offeror's response.</p>
<p>(xi) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Mar 2012), applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xii) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (Mar 2012), applies to this acquisition.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)</p>
<p>52.217-8, Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999): The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within the current period of performance. (End of clause)</p>

If 16 April 2012 delivery is not possible, offers may still be submitted with the offeror's most expeditious delivery date.<BR><BR>(a) The Government requires delivery to be made according to the following schedule: REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE [Contracting Officer insert specific details] ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT 0001 215 10.  The Government will evaluate equally, as regards time of delivery, offers that propose delivery of each quantity within the applicable delivery period specified above. Offers that propose delivery that will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. The Government reserves the right to award under either the required delivery schedule or the proposed delivery schedule, when an offeror offers an earlier delivery schedule than required above. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the required delivery schedule above will apply. OFFEROR?S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT 0001 215 (b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed, or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor?s date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term ?working day? excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. (End of Clause)<BR><BR>

<DESC>Re:  N6227112RCD9H01   Armor Plate and Anti-Spall Jacket for Robotic Platform


Item 1:  Specifications for rigid ballistic armor material:
------

Purpose: to guard systems within a small all-terrain-vehicle robot body

1) Quantity Required: 120 ft^2 (feet-square) of material in sheets 3ft x 4ft OR 4ft x 4ft,

2) Availability; need first half of order in 8 weeks from receipt of order, 2nd half in 12wks

3) Must be available in sheets 36in x48in (preferred) minimum, or larger, but no larger than 48in x48in,

4) Must not require further heat treating or leveling after cutting with waterjet,

5) Must weigh no more than 7.40 lbs/ft^2 (pounds per foot-square),

6) The finished material must withstand regularly, without fracturing, ballistic hit impacts inside of one 12in x 12in square piece, the hits consisting of at least 3 groups, each group consisting of 3 shots within a 0.75in dia circle, each group spaced no greater than 9 inches from any other group;   alternatively, it is considered acceptable performance to, without fracturing, withstand 15 hits within a 3in dia circle;  all hits consisting of M855 5.56mm projectile fired from 17meters via an M16-A2 20in barrel rifle with a muzzle velocity of 3100 feet per second and with a 83 degree angle of incident for the impact; the target test piece is considered to be free-body unconstrained.


Item 2:  Specifications for anti-spall jacket cover system:
------

Purpose: to cover critical sections of an armored, small all-terrain-vehicle robot body and prevent material from ricocheting back toward a shooter or into the vulnerable parts of the robot vehicle mechanism.

Quantity Required:  5 custom anti-spall jacket sets, covering approximately 30 ft^2 each set,

Performance requirements;

1) withstand regularly, ballistic hit impacts inside of one 12in x 12in square exposed area, the hits consisting of at least 3 groups, each group consisting of 3 shots within a 0.75in dia circle, each group spaced no greater than 9 inches from any other group, and still prevents material from ricocheting back toward the shooter or into the vulnerable parts of the robot vehicle mechanism.
  Alternatively, it is considered acceptable performance to, without fracturing, withstand 15 hits within a 3in dia circle, and still prevent material from ricocheting back toward the shooter or into the vulnerable parts of the robot vehicle mechanism.  All hits consisting of M855 5.56mm projectile fired from 17meters via an M16-A2 20in barrel rifle with a muzzle velocity of 3100 feet per second and with an 83 degree angle of incident for the impact. 

2) it weighs less than an average of 1 lb/ft^2, 

3) it functions at weather extremes of 0degC to 50degC as experienced on the firing range, 

4) it is sunlight, weather and rain resistant, 

5) it is designed specifically for the spalling characteristics and fragmentation of the projectile core of the M855 5.56mm projectile threat hitting highly hardened steel plate, 

6) it is custom designed to fit the robot armor shell, 

7) it is quickly field-attachable and replaceable in panel sections with hook-and-loop type fastening and without adhesives; ie, no hook-and-loop mating material is adhered to the base armor shell,

8) it wraps around the edges or corners of the armor shell or panels to prevent spall material from exiting out the top or sides at high velocity,

9) the bottom edges are open to allow spall material to spray or fall out to the ground,

10) the material is quilted to prevent billowing,

11) performance must be equal to or better than nylon covered, quilted aramid soft fabric rated to NIJ-IIA in the main exposed panel area and NIJ-II where it wraps around corners or edges of the armor shell or panels.

12) the covered area will be approximately 30 ft^2 and cover areas similar to the included concept drawing of the armor shell body.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: EPA Region 7 is currently located at 901 N. 5th Street in Kansas City, Kansas. Our office is scheduled to relocate to a new facility located at 11201 Renner Blvd, Lenexa, KS, in the near future. The prior tenant abandoned, and EPA has accepted a substantial quantity of Herman Miller furniture.

<DESC>THIS IS A 100% SET ASIDE FOR SERVICE-DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS (SDVOSB) CONCERNS.  Firms responding to this announcement must be registered and verified as a SDVOSB in the Vendor Information Pages (VIP) at https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov by the response date of this announcement.   

The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541310 and the applicable small business size standard is $7 million.  The area of consideration is RESTRICTED to within a 200 mile radius of the VA Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System Biloxi Campus, 400 Veterans Avenue, Biloxi, Mississippi.  The primary A/E firm's main office or an existing branch office must be located within the 200 mile radius.  The estimated construction range is $2,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00. 

The VA Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System is seeking Architect-Engineering (AE) design services to provide a full set of bid documents (Scope of Work, Drawings, Specifications, and Cost Estimate) for Project No. 520-12-101, Renovate N&FS to VCS Canteen Bldg. 21.

A/E SCOPE OF WORK
Provide professional Architect/Engineer (A/E) Services to include preliminary services,  investigative work, planning consultations and visits, design work, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, preparation of  bid items, and if necessary, respond to contractor's and subcontractor's inquiries during the bid period, preparation of as-builts drawings, preparation of cost estimates, and construction period services as necessary for construction administration and installation of all work for Project No. 520-12-101.  There will be three (3) submissions for working drawings and specification; 25%, 75%, and 100% design submissions.  
All plans and elevation drawings shall be a minimum scale of 1/8"=1'0", large scale details (minimum "=1'0") at largest possible scale to convey conditions of the work to be encountered.  All site drawings shall be a minimum of 1"=30' scale.  Drawings shall be developed by AutoCad Software Release 2008 (or better) and shall be stored on compact disk (disk to be submitted with design submissions mentioned above.) All drawings are to remain the property of the VA.
This project consists of a complete renovation of  existing kitchen of Building 21.  Included will be  major and minor floor space reallocation, significant infrastructure/utility upgrades, and upgrading of interior finishes.  All areas will be updated to meet the latest VA requirements for modernization.  This includes rehabilitation of walls, floors, ceilings, doorways, and restrooms.  Remodeling in some areas to meet new space criteria and increase space utilization.  Updating environmental controls and equipment such as ventilation fans, air handling equipment, and air distribution.  

The existing infrastructure is over 80 years old and does not meet current VCS needs or design criteria.  This includes room sizes, and configuration features and criteria for a combination of retail space and dining areas.  Potential code issues related to JCAHO, SOARS, CAP, and other required review agencies will be addressed and resolved with this project.  With the system we currently have, we are unable to compensate or make adjustments to meet the latest requirements without significantly impacting daily operations.  We intend to use this project as an opportunity to make the necessary upgrades that will allow us to maintain a complete newly renovated modern facility.  In addition, we intend to modernize VCS by upgrading finishes and utilities serving these areas. 
The VCS design will follow Department of Veterans Affairs Design Guide dated August 2005 for templates located at http://vaww.va.gov/facmgt/standard/asp.  Interior construction will meet all required codes and standards.  It is anticipated that the facility will be designed with vinyl, tile, carpet, and rubber flooring, painted gypsum wallboard system, acoustical ceiling grid systems (except wet areas), corner guards and handrails throughout hallways, and other standard medical clinic interior finishes.  The A/E will prepare a proposed color chart with all finishes for approval by VA Interior Design staff.
The design includes all mechanical and electrical systems.  Plumbing will include sanitary, hot, and cold water systems.  It is not anticipated to include any medical piping.  The HVAC system will include zoned air handlers, variable air boxes, etc. all controlled by a central computer system.  The electrical system consists of standard electrical devices (220/120V) and low-voltage systems.  The low-voltage systems will include CAT5 data and phone, panic alarms, fire alarms, security entrance systems, etc.  
The project design shall be completed in accordance with this scope of work and all appropriate Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Standards, specifications, and other criteria unless otherwise approved by VA.  The design shall be reviewed and approved by a Registered Fire Protection engineer.  The following references, as a minimum, shall be utilized for planning and design purposes:

<DESC>*SEE SOLICITATION FOR DETAILS*<br /><br />Presolicitation/Synopsis Notice: FA8601-12-B-0002 <br />Sources Sought notice published under Project 090187 on 05January 2012
<p>This notice is posted in accordance with FAR 5.2 and 36.213-2.</p>
<p>SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE ACQUISITION.</p>
<p>The NAICS code is 238220 and the Size Standard is $14M.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 4.1102 and DFARS 252.204-7004"Required Central Contractor Registration," Contractor must be registered in CCR prior to award. Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION NUMBER: FA8601-12-B-0002<br />This effort includes one project: (Project 090187), Replace Steam Lines, Area A. Project scope includes replacement of steam heat system from underground steam distribution lines with gas-fired boiler heating systems for Bldgs 879, 867, 278, 256, 1403, 293, 295 and 296. Remove overhead steam lines at Bldgs 278 and 867. The heating system components are assumed to contain asbestos containing insulating materials. Also included is the replacement of the steam heating coil inside the air handling units inside the facilities listed above, with a new hot water heating coil, along with the installation of a new HTHW to heating hot water heat exchanger, hot water pump, and new DDC controls. Special requirements/concerns related to this project: <br />High Temperature Hot Water (HTHW) steam distribution systems require specialized construction skills and safety preparations. Standard facility construction experience is not sufficient. Construction timelines are very tight since these repairs cannot be started until after the steam heating system is turned off, and must be completed in time for activation in the fall for this critical utility system. Numerous facilities will not have heat until this project is completed. Work will need to be carefully coordinated with the Mechanical Shop to minimize impact to mission. Project also includes HVAC and asbestos work.</p>
<p>The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 210 day period of performance.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of the entire contract is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>

<DESC>The US Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) Ground Vehicle Robotics (GVR) is conducting a market survey to identify the status of state-of-the-art autostereoscopic display (3D display without glasses) technology, especially with the capability to autonomously vary the location of the "eye box" based on a single user's head position as they move. In doing so, TARDEC is requesting a detailed breakdown of the cost, schedule and logistics necessary to mature an autonomously adjustable autostereoscopic display system to the provided threshold requirements. The intent of the market survey is to gather information to assess the potential for TARDEC to obtain an autonomously adjustable autostereoscopic display system with the capabilities of meeting and/or exceeding the threshold requirements, identified in Appendix A, that will successfully complete component-level maturation testing and integration/system level testing on a vehicle demonstrator. The data gathered in the market survey will help determine if a follow-on Request for Proposal (RFP) is feasible at this time. <br><br>Full desrciption and submission requirements are in the attached RFI and Appendix A. <br><br>RESPONSES:<br>Responses include three documents (at a minimum): 1) System description with component, 2) System costs (contractor format acceptable), 3) Requirements compliance (Appendix A) and 4) IMS showing development plan. Responses are requested no later than 30 days after announcement post. The Government will begin technology analysis in the short term following the 30 day submission period. Please address any questions regarding this market survey via email to matt.deminico@us.army.mil; include name, phone number and email address for a response. Questions may be answered via email or phone.<br>

<DESC>1.	Which dummy spine is being loaded?  Is it for one type of dummy or<br>	several dummies?  For example, is there a need for the equipment to load H3<br>	50th male, 5th female, etc?<br><br>	Answer: Just the HIII 50% at this time.  Possibly to be use on the WIAMan once that ATD is manufactured.  <br><br>2.	What is the injury level as defined by APG - we understand that for<br>	a 50% male H3, it is about 6 kN?<br><br>	Answer: Yes.  We are looking at the injury criteria in the Lumber Axial FZ direction at 0 ms duration is  1500 lbf.  So 25% of that is 375 lbf.  That is not a hard 	number so 375-400 lbf would be an acceptable level/range.  I would also like to add that this is would be our target and normal operating range, but we would like to 	have the potential to do something that would be greater if possible.<br>	<br>3.	Is the device required to deliver one cycle of loading to the lumbar<br>	spine? Or several cycles?  If several how many and what is the allowed time<br>	lag between 2 loading cycles?<br><br>	Answer: 1 cycle<br>	<br>4.	Is there a requirement on ramping rates for loading.  For example,<br>	if it is desired to load the lumbar spine to 1.5 kN [abput 25% of  6kN - an<br>	accepted lumbar injury level], what is the desired loading rate as a<br>	function of time?<br><br>	Answer: I am not sure if I am going to answer this directly or not, but we would like to be able to load it as fast as possible.  The idea is to simulate an under 	body blast, but at a much lower level.  <br>	<br>5.	Is the device to load the lumbar spine while it is attached to the<br>	dummy or is the lumbar spine detached from the dummy.<br><br>	We want it attached to the ATD.  This would be a test done on a complete ATD.<br><br>6.	What output is desired to be measured when the lumbar spine is<br>	loaded?<br><br>	We would like to measure the forces in the lumbar spine.  This requirement is going to be captured by me.  I would like some confirmation from their system what load 	was applied or what acceleration was applied.  For example if the ATD is in a seat, have an accelerometer on the seat.<br><br>7.	What is the intent of this device?  Is it going to be used to test<br>	the long term stability of the lumbar spine and its durability?<br><br>	The intent is come up with a validation process for validating the lumbar spine.  In a way yes, that is durability.  Our must have is the ATD remain intact for this 	process.<br><br>8.	How many duty cycles are needed per day from this equipment?<br><br>	I would say at most we would perform this test 20 times a day.	<br><br>9.	If the spine is attached to the dummy, are we required to design a<br>	restraining device for the dummy?<br><br>	Yes, would prefer the ATD to be in a seated position.  90-90-90 orientation.  Would prefer to have a "throne" that is durable and does not deflect under impacts.  A 	5 point harness would be ideal.	<br><br>10.	Does APG need just a quote or a description of the proposed device?<br><br>	Both absolutely.  Any type of diagram or figure would also be helpful to understand the device.<br><br><br>The proposing offeror should come up with a pulse rate.  The idea is to simulate an underbody blast event, but at a significantly lower level.  The injury threshold the customer is referencing is the lumbar axial compression force in the FZ direction.  The injury is 1500 lbf for 0 ms.  25% of that is 375 lbf. So somewhere between 375 and 400 lbf would be acceptable. The customer would like to add that this would be our target force, but would also like to have a system that could potentially deliver an impact greater than this.  <br><br>The controls for the system need to be provided by the successful contractor.  As part of the control they need to be able to determine the level of pulse that they provided to the ATD.  The data acquisition needs will be handled by the customer, who will measure what the ATD sees.  <br><br>The ATD is a HIII 50% male.  Specifications can be found on the manufacturers website.

No telephone calls will be accepted. PRON:  AX1F0841AX;  NOUN:  Tray, Mounting, Elect; NSN: 5975-01-560-8272; P/N:  195600-0001, Quantity: 10 each minimum/30 each maximum on a three year Basic + 2-100% Options type contract applicable to UH-60 with deliveries to Red River Army Depot, TX.  Required delivery is 10 each 175 Days After Contract Award (DACA) and 10 each year until contract completion.  This requirement is restricted to BAE Systems Information & Electronic Systems Integration I. (CAGE:  19397) because the design of this part is unstable. Engineering, manufacturing, or performance characteristics indicate that the required design objectives have not been achieved. Major changes are contemplated because the part has a low process yield or has demonstrated marginal performance during tests or service use. These changes will render the present part obsolete and unusable in its present configuration. Limited acquisition from the present source is anticipated pending configuration changes. Adequate technical data is not available for this acquisition. All offerors must meet prequalification requirements in order to be eligible for award.   Firms that recognize and can produce the required item described above are encouraged to identify themselves.  Firms are encouraged to seek source approval in order to compete for future solicitations by accessing the website www.redstone.army.mil/cmo/ and looking under Standard Aviation and Missile Source Approval Request (SAMSAR).  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.  The closing date annotated is an estimated date and may be adjusted dependent upon the date of release for solicitation; however, the solicitation will not close prior to the date stated above.

<DESC>U.S. Army Contracting Command-Redstone Arsenal, AATD Contracting Division (AATD Contracting), Fort Eustis, Virginia, proposes to acquire on an other than full and open competition basis a program entitled, 'Advanced Helicopter Electromagnetics (AHE) Research'.  This research includes analysis and development of computational tools for helicopter applications, development and improvements to Finite-Difference Time-Domain, Finite Element, Method of Moments, diffraction methods and hybrid techniques to predict the electromagnetic (EM) performance characteristics of antennas and sensors on complex composite material vehicles/airframes. In addition, research results are used to identify and develop new antenna technologies to extend and improve EM capabilities of rotorcraft and other mobile platforms. It is anticipated that a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract with a base year and 4 option years will be awarded or a IDIQ contract with orders that vary, with the first order of $110,000.  A noncompetitive acquisition to Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona 85287-0103 is intended pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1).  Arizona State is deemed to be the only known source of computational EM research dedicated to military rotorcraft applications.  No other known organization or university has compiled the extensive research data in the areas such as computational modeling of complex metallic and non-metallic helicopter structures, rotor blade modulation analysis, helicopter antenna performance, antenna coupling, lighting effects, EM wave penetration analysis for electromagnetic interference (EMI) and EM effects on rotorcraft.  In addition no other known organization has the unique scale model helicopters, computational models, helicopter geometries, and EM measurement facilities required for testing, evaluation, and verification of the research results.  The costs that would be duplicated for another organization to acquire similar capabilities are substantial.  <br>Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement and submit a proposal. Some key aspects of the proposal should include the following: <br>1. Development of computational electromagnetic (CEM) techniques for simulation of antenna performance and radio frequency (RF) sensors on complex vehicular structures, especially military helicopters, to include low-frequency full-wave, finite-difference, finite element, high-frequency asymptotic, and hybrid methods.<br>2. Development of high-fidelity vehicular computational models for all Army and selected Navy helicopters to include metallic and non-metallic surfaces/structures and rotor blades. A comprehensive CEM model database shall be maintained for identified helicopter airframe geometries for quick response to relevant antenna issues and placement studies.<br>3. Application of multiple CEM codes/methods to assess accuracy, reliability, and computational efficiency of volumetric helicopter antenna radiation characteristics to include antenna-to-antenna coupling and rotor modulation effects.<br>4. Development of precision scale model helicopter structures for validation and verification of CEM results through full and scale model measurements in a calibrated anechoic RF measurement facility or antenna range. RF measurement facilities will be made available to government member organizations for selected investigation and characterization of antennas, scale models, and RF systems.<br>5. Investigation and application of new CEM methods and antenna technologies to improve performance of helicopter EM systems. <br>All responsible sources that submit an offer will be considered.<br> A formal solicitation for this program will not be issued.  The Government will consider all submissions received within forty-six days after date of publications of this synopsis solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Proposals should be submitted no later than May 07, 2012 at 2:00 p.m. EDT and shall be submitted electronically via the Army SAFE Site (https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/SAFE/) to patricia.a.hagginbothom.civ@mail.mil and elizabeth.a.jackson.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post the questions and answers received in response to this pre-solicitation notice.<br><br>Questions <br>1. PWS Section 6.5 states that "offeror is to provide proposed Master PM Schedule"; for continuity of existing maintenance program, will Government provide existing schedule of maintenance, that an offeror can updated and modify has required? If not, will Government provide all equipment OEM maintenance documents for offeror to develop this Master PM Schedule based on the OEM recommendation? If Government cannot provide either of this information, then the incumbent contract may have an unfair advantage in the development of this Master PM Schedule. <br><br>2. Will Key Management Personnel or any personnel be allowed to work on this contract while waiting on final SECRET clearance? <br><br>3. Reference PWS Section 6.15; when is the due date for the System Operations Plan and Standard Operating Procedures for the LN2 system equipment (i.e., 30 day after contract start)? <br><br>4. Reference PWS Section 6.19; will the Government provide an estimated and/or average (over the last 3-4 years) number of under $2,500 (labor only) Incidental Repairs? <br><br>5. Reference PWS Section 6.21 and 6.22; Category 1 service orders are defined and Emergency and Category 2 is defined as Routine; the Government did not define the category for an Urgent. Is Urgent also defined as "service work must be performed immediately or loss of life, injury, impact to the mission, serious environmental impact or damage to real and installed property may result"? Or is Urgent defined as any situation that, if not corrected, could become an emergency? If there is a difference between emergency and urgent, then urgent should also have its own category and suspense time. <br><br>6. Are there any employees that are represented by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA)? If so will the Government provide the CBA? <br><br><br><br>Government Response<br><br>1. ALC recommends that each bidder seeking OEM information to find the information online.<br><br>2. Key personnel without clearance will be able to work on the contract, however, they will need to submit the proper letters, security forms, fingerprints, and have an investigation initiated through OPM in order to<br>have access to work without an escort.  The Government will not provide escorts.<br><br>3. The work plan is part of the selection criteria.  The more detailed and well thought out work plan will 30 days after award is reasonable for a final draft of the work plan.<br><br>4. Incidental repairs are included in the current contract as a lump sum. The cost data for incidental repairs is not tracked/recorded by this office.<br><br>5. Emergency and Urgent have the same meaning in the PWS.<br><br>6. ALC has no requirement for any personnel to be represented by a collective bargaining agreement.<br><br>

<CONTACT>RICHARD  HICKS, Contracting Officer, Phone 7033052261, Fax 7033052071, Email richard.hicks@fns.usda.gov - PAMELA MARTIN , Contract Specialist, Phone 7036051568, Fax 7033052071, Email pamela.martin@fns.usda.gov
<DESC><p>Request for Information for FDPIR Pilot Project<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for Request for Proposals but instead a Request for Information to solicit constructive feedback from Industry on the government's draft solicitation documents for a new Pilot project for the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR). This valuable information will assist the government in finalizing a comprehensive solicitation package scheduled for FBO release late March 2012. <br /><br />Project Background: The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food and Nutrition Service's (FNS) mission is to reduce hunger and food insecurity, in partnership with cooperating organizations, by providing children and needy people access to food, a healthful diet, and nutrition education in a manner that supports American agriculture. FNS achieves this mission by administering USDA's 15 domestic nutrition assistance programs. <br /><br />Among those programs is FDPIR, which provides food to low income households living on Indian reservations and Native American families residing in designated areas near reservations. FDPIR was established as an alternative to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program) because such areas often do not have easy access to grocery stores. <br /><br />Under FDPIR's current food distribution model, USDA buys food, which is sent to two USDA-contracted warehouses, both in Missouri. From there, food is distributed to ITOs and State agencies that administer FDPIR. This is known as the National Warehouse Model. The National Warehouse Model is not ideal because it does not provide sufficient opportunities to incorporate local and traditional foods into the FDPIR food package and has high costs associated with the centralized storage and trans-national transportation of food.<br /><br />Additionally, sites also receive fresh fruits and vegetables delivered by the Department of Defense. However, this Program will not be part of the Pilot and will continue as currently operated.<br /><br />FNS intends to pilot a Regional Distribution Model, starting in calendar year 2012. FNS will select a limited number of ITOs to participate in this Pilot, which will be "grouped" in one geographic area. There are several natural "Groupings" of ITOs throughout the nation.<br /><br />Under the proposed Pilot, USDA would contract with a vendor, which would service the Grouping selected to participate in the Pilot. Specifically, the vendor would buy USDA-approved items and distribute them directly to the ITOs, which would then prepare and distribute FDPIR food packages to program participants. This would be known as the Regional Vendor Pilot (RVP), or the Pilot.<br /><br />To be successful, the vendor selected for the Pilot must (at minimum) successfully and consistently (1) accept orders for foods that comprise the FDPIR food package from participating ITOs and Tribes, (2) deliver those foods to those organizations, (3) according to a negotiated schedule, (4) in good condition and (5) be cost-effective. <br /><br />Other anticipated benefits of the Pilot include (1) incorporation of traditional foods into the FDPIR food package, (2) greater opportunity to purchase foods from Native American producers, and (3) improved customer service for FDPIR organizations and program participants.<br /><br />FNS has drafted the following Performance-based acquisition documents meeting the government's objectives for the Pilot as follows: (1) Statement of Objectives (SOO) by which offerors will respond and from which offerors will develop their Statement of Work and Quality Assurance Plan including Performance Metrics, (2) Evaluation factors, and (3) Pricing structure. <br /><br />The government anticipates awarding one 5-year firm fixed price contract with economic price adjustments in food and fuel costs. Year one of the contract will deploy the Pilot and, if deemed successful in comparison to the performance and costs of the current Warehouse Model, including food costs, continue to increase deployment in option years 1 through 4. The expectation is to have a Nation-wide FDPIR food delivery contract by Year 5. Additionally, the government intends to make award based on best value with technical having paramount consideration over cost. Large businesses will be required to submit a negotiated subcontracting plan that will meet, to the extent practicable, the government's minimum 2012 small business goals.<br /><br />Purpose of Notice: The purpose of this notice is to receive constructive feedback from Industry on the government's Performance-based acquisition documents to determine if the structure is (1) feasible for Industry to prepare a comprehensive proposal, and (2) consistent with Industry best practices for pricing food and transportation costs, including bi-annual EPAs based on price indices.<br /><br />It is not the government's intent to completely modify its current performance-based acquisition model but to ensure that sufficient and accurate information is captured in order for the government to receive comprehensive proposals containing accurate pricing information. Vendors are asked to read the attached documents carefully to fully understand the government's requirements and respond accordingly. Your insight and feedback is valuable to FNS to ensure release of a Request for Proposals ensures competition to the maximum extent practicable.<br /><br />Vendor Responses: Interested firms shall respond by providing answers or recommended changes to the following documents:<br /><br />1) Does the draft SOO contain sufficient information for offerors to respond in years 1 through 5? If not, what other data do you recommend should be included? <br /><br />2) Are the evaluation factors clear and concise for offerors to respond? If not, what other factors do you recommend should be included?<br /><br />3) Does the pricing structure contain sufficient information for offerors to provide fixed unit food prices, overhead/administrative fees/profit and a total fixed unit price? Is it feasible for transportation costs to be a separate line item? If not, how should transportation cost be priced? Provide a thorough rationale to support recommended structure for transportation costs.<br /><br />4) Is it feasible for EPAs to be implemented every 6 months? If not, recommend the frequency and provide a thorough rationale to support the recommendation. <br /><br />5) Is it feasible for unit food prices to remain constant in option years 2 - 5 with the EPA dictating unit prices upwards or downwards? If not, provide a thorough rationale to support the recommended structure.<br /><br />6) Can the government expect quantity discounts as food commodities increase across the 5 year contract life? What other discounts, if any, can the government assume?<br /><br />7) Is the number of pages, for each evaluation factor, sufficient to prepare a comprehensive response? If not, what are the minimum number of pages would you recommend for each factor, keeping in mind a streamlined not voluminous proposal? <br /><br />8) Others?<br /><br />This is a request for information only. The government will not pay for the information prepared or submitted in response to this notice. Vendors interested in this procurement are advised to peruse FBOs for the solicitation's release. Further, the government is not interested in voluminous or marketing data in response to this request. Vendors are asked to respond only to the questions and other information relevant to this notice.<br /><br />Responses are due NLT 2 p.m. March 14, 2012 via e-mail to Richard Hicks, Contracting Officer, at Richard.hicks@fns.usda.gov. FNS is not soliciting questions as part of this Request for Information. However, the Contracting Officer is interested in any other questions, comments or concerns potential offerors may have on this effort for the government's consideration.</p>

<DESC>The US Department of Interior, through its Franchise Fund activity, Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD), is issuing this solicitation, Number D12PS00214 as a Request for Proposals (RFP) on behalf of the US Department of Agriculture, Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS). AQD anticipates awarding a single Firm Fixed Price contract to Renovate the Al Sewaira Agricultural Research Station. The contract will be awarded for a base period of 120 days.  This is an acquisition for commercial products and services and will be conducted using the guidance in FAR 12, FAR 15 and FAR 36. The applicable NAICS code is 237110, "Water and Sewer Line and related Structure Construction". The small business size standard is $33.5 million. This procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis, open to large and small business concerns.
PURPOSE OF the contractSCOPE OF WORK: As part of its capacity building efforts in Iraq, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is working with the Government of Iraq (GOI) to renovate the Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture=BFs (IMOA) Al Sewaira Agricultural Research Station, located in Wasit province.   This USDA project is being managed by USDA=BFs Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and is part of an overall United States Government effort to build capacity in various areas within the Government of Iraq.  USDA is working to build the capacity of the GOI in agricultural research and extension, as well as other agriculture-related subject areas. In a general Letter of Agreement between the USDA and the Iraq Ministry of Agriculture signed March 3, 2011, USDA and the IMOA agreed to collaborate on the renovation of the Al Sewaira Agricultural Research Station.  The Al Sewaira Research Station is located in Wasit province approximately 60 km (35 miles) southeast of Baghdad and covers approximately 150 hectares (375 acres or 625 donums) of fertile land.  It is located approximately 2,150 meters from the Al-Dohan canal, which is its primary source of water for irrigation.  Irrigation water is currently supplied from the canal via an open trench from the Al-Dohan Canal.  The Al Sewaira Research Station was established to conduct research on water management techniques and other aspects of agricultural production.  Its experimental fields are also used for extension purposes.  The major problems facing the Station are inadequate water supply, outdated and inefficient irrigation systems, and blockage of drainage pipes.  The renovation of the Station will improve the supply of irrigation water to the Station and improve the irrigation and drainage system used on the Station in order to improve the agricultural research and extension capacity of the Station.  FAS=BF Office of Agricultural Affairs is located in the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq and is part of the FAS global network of agricultural economists, marketing experts, negotiators, and other specialists stationed in more than 90 countries to support U.S. agricultural interests.  One of the key objectives of the Agricultural Affairs Office is to develop a regionally competitive and sustainable agricultural and food sector in Iraq.USDA has an Agricultural Counselor stationed at the Embassy who serves as the senior USDA official in Iraq.  Also currently stationed there is a USDA Soil and Water Conservation advisor.  The USDA Agricultural Counselor and the USDA Soil and Water Conservation Advisor, or their designees, will be the contractor=BFs USDA points of contact in Iraq.  
The contractor will provide the personnel, labor, supervision, equipment, transportation, and materials needed to fulfill the requirements.  In summary, the contractor shall conduct the renovation of the Al Sewaira Agricultural Research Station in Iraq by:
1)	Confirming to USDA in writing through meetings and site visits, all of the equipment, materials and their specifications needed; 
2)	Coordinating with IMOA on the timing for installation of pipes and equipment  to be delivered;

5)	Procuring and delivering equipment  and confirming good working order upon delivery 
6)	Demonstrating that the materials and equipment installed are working as designed with pipes and equipment to be installed by the IMOA.
Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR Part 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of the firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to conduct a full and open competition under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (a) and in accordance with FAR Part 15 for the Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) Technology Development (TD) contract. NAVAIR does not intend to use the provisions of FAR Part 12 for this acquisition. This is a follow on contract to existing Technology Maturation (TM) efforts being performed under contracts N00019-10-C-0070 (BAE Systems), N00019-10-C-0071 (ITT Corporation), N00019-10-C-0072 (Northrop Grumman Corporation) and N00019-10-C-0073 (Raytheon Company) which were awarded as a result of Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N00019-09-R-0238. The objective of the TD phase is to develop a cost effective jammer system to enhance aircraft survivability. NGJ is an electronic attack system that will provide significantly improved Airborne Electronic Attack capabilities against advanced threats through enhanced agility and precision within jamming assignments, increased interoperability and expanded broadband capability for greater threat coverage against a wide variety of radio frequency emitters. Initially, the NGJ system will be integrated on the EA-18G tactical aircraft to replace aging ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System pods.</p>
<p>The successful offeror in the TD phase will be required to mature and demonstrate critical technologies, complete the system architecture, and complete the requirements derivation and decomposition to subsystems. The TD phase will include: (1) Technology Readiness Assessments (TRAs) that substantiate Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 for Increment 1 (mid-band) Critical Technology Elements (CTEs); (2) System Designs to a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) to establish the functional and allocated baselines for Increment 1; and (3) Refining technical trade space including those to improve affordability, system efficiency, and host platform compatibility.</p>
<p>The Government intends to release a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) in early April 2012, including sections L&amp;M. Industry input will be sought prior to the release of the Formal RFP in mid June 2012. Proposals will be required 60 days after Formal RFP release.</p>
<p>Publicly releasable unclassified documentation such as the RFP sections A-M will be posted directly on the NAVAIR Open Solicitation Homepage website (http://www.navair.navy.mil/) and listed under "Business Opportunities/Open Solicitations" as solicitation number N00019-12-R-0035. All subsequent RFP amendments and publicly releasable documentation will reside on the NAVAIR Open Solicitation Homepage and will not be posted to any other website to include FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>Unclassified documentation with distribution statement restrictions such as the Statement of Work and Contract Data Requirement s Lists (CDRLs) will be made available through a secure website that will serve as an unclassified virtual bidder's technical library. Other documentation to include Industry Day briefs, the voluntary interested vendors list, and Industry Day Questions &amp; Answers will be posted to this library as well. Access to this library will be restricted to potential Prime Contractors. A list of all classified documentation will be hosted on the technical library along with procedures for access to these documents. Potential Contractors are asked to submit comments, questions, and requests for additional information directly to Kara Briscoe at kara.briscoe@navy.mil or by phone at (301) 757-7086.</p>
<p>Please note that potential Prime contractors will need a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate and NAVAIR Applications (APPS) domain account to access the unclassified virtual bidder's external library. If a potential contractor does not already possess a PKI, please consult the following site for details on how to obtain a compliant Medium Assurance PKI certificate: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html. Be advised that this process can nominally take several weeks to complete.</p>

<a href="mailto:gillian.david@me.navy.mil">gillian.david@me.navy.mil</a>
<DESC>This is not a request for either a quote or proposal, or an invitation for bid. The intent of this pre-solicitation synopsis is to identify potential Offerors for the replacement of four floating finger piers at Quay  9, Jebel-Ali, UAE. 

The contractor shall provide all the necessary materials, tools, labor, and supervision to dispose the existing finger pier and design, build, and install four new floating finger piers. The proposed finger piers shall have a new configuration, which includes a wider 1.3-m (4.3-foot) and longer 9.0-m (29.6-foot) finger deck that replaces the existing 0.8-m (2.6-foot) by 8.0-m (26.2-foot) version. The new finger piers shall have a rectangular-shaped float and a total of four rubber link connections.
 The basic dock structure consists of the flotation pontoon, the structural frame, and the deck. Flotation pontoons shall consist of a foam core completely encapsulated in a protective shell to prevent contact with water or other deleterious elements. The foam generally consists of expanded polystyrene (EPS) closed cell blocks, but other types of foam may be used. Although the foam should be protected by the shell from water contact; certain materials may lose their water-tightness over time. This shall be acceptable if the maximum water absorption of the EPS core is limited to less than 3% as determined by ASTM Standard C272, Method C, the amount of reground material is limited to less than 10%, and the form core is preformed to the interior configuration of the pontoon as a solid block.
 Deck surface shall withstand prolonged exposure to the elements (sunlight, wetting/drying, freezing/thawing etc.), severe abrasion by scuffing and dropped objects, and fatigue due to dock motions and flexing. Further, the surface shall be non-skid, and resistant to staining by spills and dirt. Additional details and specifications will be posted together with the full solicitation.

This is a negotiated procurement utilizing single phase design build selection procedures. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions based on a successful offeror whose proposal provides the best value to the Government. Selection for award will be based on Experience, Safety, Past Performance, and Technical Solution.

The completion time for this contract is 240 calendar days after award.
 

The Solicitation will be available in electronic format only.

**The total estmiate cost of  thsi project is between $400,000.00 and $500,000.00**

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued around mid/late April 2012. The solicitation will be listed as N33191-12-R-1020 on the European Navy Electronic Commerce Online website (EURONECO) at: https://euro.neco.navy.mil. A Vendor User Guide is available for download at the site, as well as the EuroNECO Help Desk contact phone number for any issues/questions related to the website.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
				      Office of Acquisition Operations
    			                 Technology Acquisition Center
     				      1701 Directors Boulevard, Suite 600
      			      Austin, TX 78744

2.	Description of the Action: The proposed action is for a firm fixed-price contract for VA Travel Management Center Services.  These services will be used by all of VA for temporary duty (TDY) travel and permanent change of station (PCS) situations.  The program is managed by VA Financial Services Center in Austin, Texas. The period of performance for this action is one year with an option to extend services for an additional six (6) months.  

3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  VA requires commercial travel services to execute its mission.  VA's travel requirements include travel arrangements for those individuals covered under Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) Chapter 301 - Temporary Duty Allowances, traveling on official business away from their normal duty location.  This includes employees traveling in conjunction with a PCS/relocation, non-employees such as interviewees performing pre-employment interview travel, and invitational travelers.  VA's travel requirements also include authorized travel arrangements for those not covered under the FTR such as Beneficiary patient travelers and their companion travelers.  VA requires services of a contractor knowledgeable in the areas of Federal travel to include authorizations, reservations, ticketing, fulfillment, and reporting and management, including commercial travel office or travel management center services.  The contractor must have the ability, knowledge, and skills in the areas of information technology, call center services, global distribution systems, government travel suppliers, the handling of personally identifiable information, the Privacy Act and Federal Travel Regulations.  The total estimated price including the option period is $4,651,456.66.

4.	Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5), "when a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made through another agency or from a specified source", as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-5.  For this action, 38 U.S.C. 8127(c), known as the Veterans First Contracting Program, provides the authority to directly contract with a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).

5.	Reason for Authority Cited:  The proposed source for this action is Duluth Travel, Inc. (Duluth), 2860 Peachtree Industrial Boulevard, Suite 100, Duluth, Georgia, 30097, a certified SDVOSB.  Duluth currently performs the same services for VA and has proven that it has the required capabilities to meet all of the Government's requirements.  Duluth possesses a combination of the program management and travel regulation knowledge necessary to complete this project.  In light of the above, the Government's technical experts have determined that Duluth is capable of meeting all of the Government's requirements and is considered a responsible SDVOSB.

6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted and the details are contained in the market research section below.  In addition, consistent with the guidelines of the Veterans First Contracting Program, the proposed action described herein will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities Page in accordance with FAR Part 5.

7.	Actions to Increase Competition:  All future requirements will be handled on a case-by-case basis to determine any future acquisition strategy.

8.	Market Research:  Market research was conducted by searching the VetBiz.gov database on February 17, 2012 to determine that Duluth Travel is a SDVOSB.  This search concluded that Duluth  is registered and certified  and qualifies as a SDVOSB in accordance with the federal small business size standard for the applicable North American Industry Classification System code 561510.  A search performed on February 17, 2012 showed that Duluth is registered in the Central Contractor Registration and is eligible to receive a Government contract.  The Government's technical experts have determined that Duluth is technically capable of meeting the Government's requirements. 

9.	Other Facts:  The Procuring Contracting Officer has determined that this procurement meets all the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 8127 (c).  This procurement is below the $5,000,000.00 threshold, Duluth has been determined to be a responsible SDVOSB for performance of the services herein; and the proposed contract can be awarded at a fair and reasonable price.

<DESC>The Forest Service intends to purchase and install up to 20 Operational Loads Monitoring Systems (OLMS) on Government-owned aircraft involved in aerial firefighting. This equipment monitors and determines operational loads experienced within the low level fire suppression environment. The OLMS is comprised of all equipment required for recording to acquire, record, and transmit required parameters experienced by a firefighting aircraft during flight operations. Currently, the Forest Service has 31 systems which were purchased from Appareo Systems under a previous contract. These systems were certified and had been installed by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Field Approval or Supplemental Type Certificates (STC) in aircraft.
<p>These systems collect detailed flight data which is written to a Secure Digital (SD) card in the Appareo manufactured GAU 2000. The GAU 2000 is DO-160 certified and has been installed by FAA Field Approval or supplemental type certificate (STC) in aircraft. This approval is mandatory for all equipment installed on Forest Service owned or contracted aircraft.</p>
<p>The operation of this system is as follows: After a mission has been flown and the aircraft lands, the SD card is removed from the GAU 2000 and processed by an Appareo developed file transfer program. This program performs initial quality checks of the flight data and sends it to the Appareo data processing server via the internet. The server then parses the data, performs additional quality assurance of the data and creates a gps file for the Appareo Alerts application and a file in the .s3t format is posted to the Forest Service library database hosted by nCode International. The data supplied through this chain has to maintain quality and represent the flight that was flown. This data is used by the Forest Service through an interagency agreement with the FAA and their center for excellence at Wichita State University (WSU). WSU has created a software application to process the data collected from the Appareo OLMS. Currently, the library holds over 15,000 flight hours. Once processed, WSU creates an Operational Loads report for the specific special mission profile (Large Air tanker, Smokejumper, Lead plane, etc.) which is then published by the FAA through the grant funded by the Forest Service. Once published, these reports document the aerodynamic loads experienced by firefighting aircraft. These reports can then be used to formulate appropriate maintenance and inspection programs for these aircraft ensuring their safe operation and averting catastrophic structural failures.</p>
<p>Due to the proprietary nature of the equipment and software developed and installed by Appareo Systems, they are the only source able to service and maintain these systems. Appareo's continued support of these systems and the data collected is critical to assuring that the data gathered is valid. Replacing the existing OLMS with a system from a different manufacturer would invalidate the 15,000 hours of flight data previously collected and would not guarantee that future data would correlate to the previously collected data.</p>
<p><strong>Any responses to this requirement must be submitted to the undersigned for consideration no later than 4:30 PM MDT on April 11, 2012.</strong></p>
