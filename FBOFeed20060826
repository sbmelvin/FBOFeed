<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) intends to award a purchase order to the Remington Arms Company Inc. for 300 Remington model 870 P, 12 gauge, 3" magnum capable shotgun, with a synthetic pistol grip stock and fore end.  The stock will have a 13" length of pull and a Remington R-3 recoil pad.

A law enforcement trigger group, one-shot magazine extension and a non-reflective parkerized finish.  A rear sling swivel on stock and a side-sling mount on the one-shot extension.
