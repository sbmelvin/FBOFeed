Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Sole Source is based upon this vendor being the only manufacturer/vendor able to satisfy this requirement:

This is a purchase to upgrade the existing Avaya telephone switch?s five digit dialing plan to seven digit dialing.  All equipment and software is proprietary to Avaya, Inc.  If another vendor is used, additional switches would need to be installed, as well as costs expended to train the personnel to maintain this critical infrastructure. Duplication of funds and personnel would occur due to the fact that existing service could not cover non-AVAYA equipment, and new personnel would not service or maintain existing switching equipment. There would also be a learning curve and interruption of mission support.  Both are difficult to measure.  If another company were allowed to provide the service there would be a substantial duplication of costs due to maintenance/compatibility issues not expected to be recovered through competition.

<CONTACT>Jonathan Tringali, Contract Specialist, Phone 719-556-3843, Email jonathan.tringali@peterson.af.mil
<DESC>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (Onity) for a complete installed keyless entry system under the authority of FAR 13.106.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 48 Hours after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally by considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Sole Source is based upon the sole source justification document below.  



SUBJECT:  Single/Sole Source Requirement Request, PR #

a.  Pikes Peak Lodge currently uses a combination of keyless entry system locks and regular hard key locks.  In today?s heightened security it is imperative that our entire facility obtain keyless entry locks for the protection of our guests. Keyless entry systems offer more security due to the fact that if a key is lost ,stolen or the guest accidentally takes it home with them the lock can be re-programmed easily and does not require changing out the entire lock.  The system we require must be compatible with our property management system and be one of the authorized Air Force Services Agency vendors for keyless entry.  It must also be able to withstand the weather/elements as half of our facilities are exterior facilities. It must provide easy access to the facilities (room doors and facility entry doors)  and be proven to be reliable. The cost of this system is approximately 

b  Onity offers unique qualifications because it is the only system that provides a weather kit for exterior locks.  The weather kit is imperative to our system again, due to our exterior facilities.  It has been proven that the other two vendors we have received quotes from do not withstand the weather/outdoor elements.   Pikes Peak Lodge currently has one of the systems we have received a quote from and it has proven to be unreliable and does not withstand the elements very well.  We have also had incidents where guests have been locked in and out of their rooms which posed a serious safety hazard.  

c.  Onity is one of the three companies that the HQ Air Force Services Agency authorizes lodging operations to use.  You can only purchase the Onity products directly from Onity, no other company sells the Onity product as they are a sole distributor.  We have contacted the company directly and researched on the Internet to prove this statement.

d.  We conducted market research by having the three vendors come to Peterson to do a site visit and show us hands-on their products capabilities.  We found through these site visits that Onity was the best product for Pikes Peak Lodge because it offered all of the required features listed in paragraph 1a.  

	f.  The purchase of a keyless entry system that provides a weather package that will withstand the elements (makes the locks more reliable) is crucial to our military personnel accomplishing the AF mission.  If a guest is locked in-or out of their room they will not be able to meet their deadlines or meetings the AF has set forth.  It also places our valuable troops in harms way when they have the potential of not being able to exit their room in case of a fire or seek shelter during inclement weather/during real world force protection changes.	 

g.  The main barrier we face in open competition is that our system will not be compatible with our property management system.  Compatibility is the key in making the keyless entry system work properly.  That is why the HQ AFSVA suggests only certain vendors because our PMS is unique to the AF.

2.  I certify that this single/sole source request is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Services Acquisition Center, GSA SmartPay? program, is requesting proposals for the future program, known as GSA SmartPay? 2 (?SP2?). 

GSA SmartPay? is the largest government charge card program in the world.  Today, use of purchase, travel, fleet, and integrated charge cards under the program has grown into a $25 billion a year business encompassing 350 government agencies/organizations and in excess of 92 million transactions annually.  

As the agent for our customer agencies, we are looking to contract with firms that offer secure, innovative products that support government needs ? which can vary greatly in diversity and complexity from agency to agency ? at a reasonable price.       

GSA seeks to provide improvements from the existing contract in a number of areas, including:

?	New products and services.  New products and services as core requirements, separately priced items, and value added items, including:  pre-paid cards, contactless cards, and cards in foreign currencies.  The Government also desires offerors to propose alternatives to convenience check use;

?	Enhanced customer service.  24/7 worldwide customer service has been expanded to include the option for agencies/organizations to receive foreign language customer support for cardholders using their cards overseas, as specified at the task order level;

?	Security of systems and data.  The SP2 solicitation contains increased security requirements regarding data management and handling, including new requirements that successful offerors comply with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) and the Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standards, house their data facilities in the United States, and restrict data access to personnel with the required level of security clearance.  In addition, successful offerors will be required to comply with new program data and interface standards; 

?	Interchange rates.  Lower interchange rates for government to government transactions are required, as well as reduced rates or other alternative approaches for ?large ticket? purchases; 

?	Enhanced data capture.  Innovative solutions are sought from offerors to improve the quality of data (e.g., expanded collection of Level 3 data) to support the Government?s strategic sourcing initiatives, risk mitigation measures, management reports, and other program reporting objectives; 

?	Tax reclamation.  Improvements in tax recovery are required to facilitate recovery of taxes paid by agencies/organizations on tax exempt government transactions; and

?	Live test demonstrations.  Offerors determined to be within the competitive range will be required to submit their Electronic Access Systems to GSA testing.  

The contract period for SP2 includes a transitional period and a transactional period.  The transitional period begins on the date of award and ends November 29, 2008.  The transactional period (when actual transactions can begin to be processed through systems belonging to/associated with successful offerors) begins as early as November 30, 2007, and has a four-year base period, with one four-year option period, and one three-year option period.


Potential offerors should read the solicitation carefully.  Questions or comments regarding the RFP can be submitted from the date of solicitation issuance until 4:30 pm Eastern Time, October 10, 2006.  All comments/questions regarding this RFP must be received by this time, and shall include reasoning associated with any suggested changes/comments to the RFP.  The Government will periodically post replies to these questions/comments on the FedBizOpps website (www.fedbizopps.gov).  Please e-mail any comments or questions to: bertha.gelhaus@gsa.gov.

Proposals submitted in response to this RFP via commercial express delivery should be sent to:

Bertha L. Gelhaus, Contracting Officer
GSA/FSS/FCXC
2200 Crystal Drive, Suite 706
Arlington, VA 22202 

Proposals submitted via the U. S. Postal Service, are sent to the same address as above, except the zip code to be used is: 20406.

Proposals are due no later than 4:30 pm Eastern Time, Tuesday, November 28, 2006. Thank you for your interest in the GSA SmartPay? 2 program.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse plans to procure services from a qualified organization having the capability to produce, store, and distribute labeled and unlabeled opioid peptides and related neuropeptides.  These may include, but are not limited to, unlabeled, tritum or I-125 labeled opioid peptides, and related compounds.  Qualified organizations must be able to check the stability and purity of the compounds, maintain and store the compound inventory under secure conditions, and distribute the compounds to research investigators.   In order to meet the demand for authentic, pure, and racemization free peptides, NIDA will require the contractor to maintain an inventory of approximately 40-45 peptides and some of their respective radio labeled compounds (approximately 23-25) and supply them primarily to NIDA grantees for use in NIDA supported studies and at the same time maintain capability to rapidly synthesize, on demand, new peptides that are potentially useful in drug abuse research.  NIDA expects to award a 5-year contract. RFP No. N01DA-6-7758 will be available electronically on or about December 29, 2005 and may be accessed through the Internet at: www.fedbizopps.gov or through the NIDA website address: www.nida.nih.gov/RFP/RFPList.html.  The electronic RFP contains all information needed to submit an offer.  No printed version of the solicitation document or source list is available.  NIDA will consider proposals submitted by any responsible offeror. Proposals will be due on or about February 23, 2006. Following proposal submission and the initial review, the Contracting Officer may require additional documentation from offerors in the competitive range.   This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. See Note 26.

<CONTACT>Thomas Parenteau, Contracting Officer, Phone 850-452-4616 X3113, Fax 850-452-9398, Email thomas.parenteau@navy.mil
<DESC>Purpose:  The purpose of Phase I of this Solicitation is to select no more than ten (10) firms to participate in Phase II of the Solicitation process where the Government will select up to four proposals considered in the best interest of the Government using the best value continuum and tradeoff process in a negotiated acquisition for contract award.  

General Overview:  This procurement will result in the award of up to four (4) separate Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction Contracts for Roofing.  The project title is "Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) for Roofing for the Pensacola Region”.  This procurement will be a single solicitation using a two-step process resulting in the award of four IDIQ MACC Contracts for a base and three option years, each with a minimum guarantee of $25,000.00, and not-to-exceed amount of $2,500,000.00 per year per contract.  The guaranteed minimum of $25,000.00 applies to the life of each contract.  The total not-to-exceed for the base and three option years for all four contracts is $40,000,000.00 ($10,000,000.00 per contract).  

Projects assigned to the IDIQ contracts will use the Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) approach to scope and price the work.  The requirement for construction schedules will be determined prior to the issuance of each task order.  The work will be ordered by individual task order on an "as needed as required basis".  Task orders may range in value from $2,000.00 to $1,500,000.00, with multiple simultaneous orders at various locations possible.  After award of the initial contract(s), contractors will compete for task orders based on a best value, low price or low price technically acceptable to the Government basis.  Construction schedules will be determined prior to the issuance of each task order.  If a minimum of two offerors remain in the pool during contract duration, this will satisfy the competitive requirements and preclude the necessity of soliciting for a replacement contractor if for any reason one of the contracts is terminated or one of the offerors is excluded from participation in the process.  

Small Business Set-Aside:  This overall procurement is being advertised on an unrestricted basis, with one contract reserved for award to a qualified 8(a) Small Business firm, and one contract reserved for award to a qualified HubZone Small Business firm, the remaining contracts will be awarded on an unrestricted basis using full and open competition.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 238160, Roofing Contractors, and the Size Standard is $13M.  The Government will include all applicable price evaluation preferences in its evaluation.  The seed project will be awarded on a "Best Value" basis, and subsequent task orders competed among the successful contractors.  

Phase I Proposal Evaluation:  Phase I of this procurement will result in a narrowing of offerors to approximately seven to ten firms based on technical evaluation factors that include:  Factor A – Past Performance, Factor B – Technical Qualifications & Experience, Factor C – Scheduling, and Factor D – Small Business Subcontracting Effort.  These Phase I factors relate to the base year and three option year IDIQ contract requirements for repair and/or replacement of the following roof systems and all associated work to include temporary roof repairs and dry-ins:  

BUILT-UP ROOF
MODIFIED BITUMEN ROOF
EPDM SINGLE-PLY ROOF	
ASPHALT SHINGLE ROOF
TILE ROOF
METAL ROOF
WATERPROOF ELASTOMERIC ROOF COATING

The seed project requirements and contract specs will be added by amendment at the conclusion of Phase I. 

Pre-Proposal Conference:  A non-mandatory pre-proposal conference is scheduled for 1:00 PM on Thursday 13 April 2006 at the main conference room of the NAVFAC ROICC Office, bldg. 746, 520 Turner St. NAS Pensacola, FL.  A site visit for the seed project will be scheduled for a later date.

The Ministere de l'Energie et des Mines requested U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) assistance to explore transportation options from its phosphate mines to one of its ports.  The exploitation of the Matam deposit is predicated on finding an efficient mode of transportation to modern export ships, hence the focus of the proposed Feasibility Study.  There are a number of transportation options that would be considered in the Feasibility Study. These options include, but are not limited to: 
(I)Rail: Transportation of phosphate by rail requires the construction of a new line connecting to the existing rail network, and then upgrade of the existing network to heavy haul standards.  There are four individual rail alternatives. (II)River: Transportation of phosphate by barge down the Senegal River to St. Louis (III)By Road or partial Road/Rail: Transport by road to a port or transformation plant, or to rail transshipment stations at Goudiry, Tambacounda, Louga ou Kebemer. (IV)By slurry pipeline to port or intermediate point.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Matam Phosphate Transportation Feasibility Study include:

(I)Review of existing material, operations and stakeholder interviews
(II)Phosphate movement forecast
(III)Transportation model
(IV)Regulatory review
(V)Develop financing alternatives
(VI)Preliminary environmental impact assessment
(VII)Developmental impact assessment
(VIII)Sources of supply
(IX)Implementation plan
(X)Final report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $313,840 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and French directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM (Local Time), November 10, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

N/A 16. N/A 17. This is a Department of the Army notice of proposed contract action.  The Government intends to award a purchase order using FAR Part 13 procedures to Freestate Electrical Service Company, Beltsville, MD for the installation of conduit raceways within the building located at 4501 Ford Avenue, Alexandria, VA 22302. Consistent with the requirement at FAR 5.207(c)(14), the Government justifies the lack of competition for the following reason:  The lessor of the building, pursuant to the terms of lease # GS -11B-01849, has the exclusive right to determine what vendor, if any, shall be permitted to install equipment in that building.  Any inquiries must be received no later than 11:30 AM Central Time, September 30, 2006. The proposed order constitutes the acqu isition of a commercial item, as that term is defined in FAR 2.101 and referenced in FAR 5.203(a)(1) and FAR 5.203(c).  See government-wide numbered note 22.  Within that note 45 days is changed to read 2 days.  Although the proposed contractual action  has been synopsized through the Government-wide Point of Entry (GPE) by way of this notice, the solicitation will not be made available through the GPE.  The Government will not make the solicitation available through the GPE because, in accordance with t he exception at FAR 5.102(a)(4)(ii), the nature of the file does not make it practicable for the Contracting Officer to provide access through the GPE.  The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by industry in the preparation of respons es to this announcement.   18. Alexandria, VA 19. N/A

<DESC>ATTACHMENT 1
SUBMISSION OF PROPOSAL, EVALUATION CRITERIA 
AND BASIS FOR AWARD
REVISION 01, 9/27/06


1.  ALTERNATE PROPOSAL INFORMATION
 
Alternate proposals are not solicited, are not desired, and shall not be evaluated.
  
 2.  OFFEROR ACCEPTANCE PERIOD
 
The offeror shall, by signature, certify that for a period of not less than 30 calendar days the bid will be valid.
  
 3.   PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS
 
   a.  GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
 
     1.  Any resultant contract shall include the general provisions applicable to the selected offeror's organization and type of agreement awarded.  Any additional clauses required by public law, executive order, or acquisition regulations, in effect at the time of execution of the proposed contract, shall be included.
 
     2.  The proposal must be prepared in two parts:  a "Technical Proposal" and a "Business Proposal."  Each part shall be separate and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently from evaluation of the other.  The technical proposal must not contain reference to cost; however, resource information (such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, subcontracts, etc.) must be contained in the technical proposal so that the contractor's understanding of the statement of work may be evaluated.
 
     3.  Amendments to Proposal - Any changes to a proposal made by the offeror after its initial submittal (i.e., in the Best and Final Proposal) shall be accomplished by replacement pages.  Changes from the original page shall be indicated on the outside margin by vertical lines adjacent to the change.  The offeror shall include the date of the amendment on the lower right corner of the changed pages.
 
     4. The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with evaluation criteria set forth in the RFP. Failure to respond or follow the instructions regarding the organization and content of the Technical and the Business Proposals may result in the Offeror's proposal being removed from further consideration.
 
     5.  It is anticipated that this solicitation will result in a Blanket Purchase Agreement with up to 5 firms.   After award, quotes will be sought on a competitive basis among all holders on the BPA to acquire services.  Offerors will be required to submit their proposal within 24 hours.  Award of the BPA call will be determined based on price and schedule.

     6.  FEMA will give BPA award preference first to companies meeting the criteria established in FAR 52.226-3.  In the event additional awards are required in order to satisfy the requirements, FEMA reserves the right to award additional contracts to firms not meeting the criteria in FAR 52.226-3.  FEMA also reserves the right to issue a sole source call order based upon urgent and compelling requirement.
 
   b.  TECHNICAL PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS
 
       The technical proposal shall be limited to 20 single-sided pages, font size 12. Any pages in excess of 20 will not be evaluated.  The 20 pages refer to offeror?s response to Factors 1 and 3 only.  Offeror may also submit a limit of 5 pages of graphics (i.e., base camp layouts, service buildings, etc.).  Technical proposals shall be submitted in the following format and shall address each of the following evaluation factors:

FACTOR 1:  SCENARIO FOR SOLICITATION OF BASE CAMP SERVICES

    The offeror shall provide a narrative response to the scenario located at Attachment 3.

Evaluation Criteria:  This is an acceptable/unacceptable submittal.  Offeror must provide an acceptable plan that addresses the criteria set out in the Scenario.  Offeror has to demonstrate it has the staff and management operations to support this requirement and has the necessary equipment to establish the base camp within the required timeframe.  The following is a list of items that the government would expect to find addressed, but is not limited to:  

1)	how the offeror will satisfy requirements for:  food quality and safety; HV/AC; camp hygiene; showers, portable toilets, and hand wash stations; laundry service; ALS qualified medical unit; MWR area and equipment; Admin area; check-in of occupants; ID badging; fence camp; background checks of contractor personnel;

2)	how the offeror will provide the equipment needed to establish and operate the camp; what type of equipment is being offered;

3)	how the offeror will conduct quality control and comply with local codes, permits, etc.
 

     FACTOR 2:  PAST PERFORMANCE.  The Offeror shall provide a list of references which will include:  company name, point of contact, phone, e-mail address, fax, contract number (if applicable), brief description of work performed, dollar value, and period of performance.  Projects shall be completed within the past three (3) years.
 
Evaluation Criteria.  Past performance reflects how well the offeror has performed these services.  Major Subcontractor (performing 20% or more of the requirement) past performance will be accepted.  When determining each offeror?s overall past performance rating, the Government will place more emphasis on projects that are similar in scope, effort, and magnitude to this requirement and those with a longer performance history. 

 	(1)  The Government will evaluate quality of service, communications, customer satisfaction, corrective action taken, and any other issues determined to be relevant to the requirement.  The Government will consider similarity in scope of work, magnitude, dollar value, management effort of the submitted projects and the overall experience of the firm in the evaluation.  

(2)  The absence of past performance will result in a neutral rating of ?none? for that subfactor, in which the offeror will not be rated favorably or unfavorably.  However, a neutral rating may be considered a higher performance risk and may affect the offeror?s overall ranking.  

(3)  Offerors whose past performance information is the determining factor preventing them from being considered for award will be afforded the opportunity to address adverse past performance information.

		(4)  This is an acceptable/unacceptable submittal.  Contractor must receive ?Satisfactory? ratings from past performance references or other past performance sources to pass this factor or have a ?Neutral? rating.


FACTOR 3:  MANAGEMENT TEAM 

    The offeror shall provide a narrative response that provides:

1)	A brief firm history; identify how long the firm has been in business and the type of services the firm provides;

2)	A brief narrative on the experience of the key personnel and management; and

3)	The expertise level of the staff that would establish and manage the camp.

Evaluation Criteria:  This is an acceptable/unacceptable submittal. Experience is defined as the overall experience of the firm and specific projects, in progress or completed, that are for services similar to this requirement.  Experience of the offeror?s proposed project manager and other key personnel may be considered for those newly formed entities without previous work experience. Major Subcontractor (performing 20% or more of the requirement) experience will be considered.  When determining each offeror?s management team experience rating, the Government will place more emphasis on projects that are similar in scope, effort, and magnitude to this requirement and those with a longer performance history. 


    FACTOR 4:  BUSINESS PROPOSAL

The Offeror shall submit a Business Proposal.  

a.  A Pricing Proposal for evaluation purposes ONLY that will be based upon the Scenario found at Attachment 3 shall be submitted.  Pricing should reflect a monthly rate for Base Camp Operations, which includes all labor, materials, and other associated costs, based on an occupied per-person/per day (PPPD) rate and an un-occupied PPPD rate.  Price will be firm-fixed-price.  The total BPA ceiling for all offerors awarded a BPA will be $50,000,000.00.  Offeror shall provide back-up documentation on how they arrived at their proposed prices and the PPPD rate(s). The Offeror shall enter fixed unit rates, calculate extended totals by line item, and sum the amounts by a grand total. Offeror may suggest/recommend other pricing formats than that reflected in Section B in a separate narrative paragraph; however, the pricing proposal shall reflect pricing as it is shown in Section B.
 
     	       b.  Other Business Information To Be Furnished
 
   	 	(1)  Representations, Certifications, and Other Statements of Offerors -- Representations, Certifications, and Other Statements of Offerors shall be completed on line on https://orca.bpn.gov.  The Offeror shall provide its DUNS Number to enable the government to access this information.  

     		(2)  Summary of Deviations/Exceptions in the Business Proposal - The offeror will explain any deviations, exceptions or conditional assumptions taken with respect to this part of the RFQ. Any exceptions taken shall carry sufficient amplification and justification to permit evaluation.  Such exceptions will not of themselves, automatically cause a proposal to be termed unacceptable. A large number of exceptions or one or more significant exceptions not providing any obvious benefit to the Government may, however, result in rejection of such proposal(s) as unacceptable.  Highlight exceptions in the margin of the proposal where they appear in the text.
 
      		(3)   Documentation that supports that a Firm is Residing or Primarily Doing Business in the State of TX.  In order for a firm to be considered ?residing or primarily doing business in the State of TX,? the Offeror must submit documentation that supports the assertion.  A non-exclusive list of factors is provided in IAW FAR 52.226-3, which may be considered by the Government as proof to support the offeror?s assertion that it is primarily doing business in the State of Texas.

Evaluation Criteria.  

(1)	Price will be evaluated using price analysis to determine the extent to which it is reasonable, realistic, and consistent with the proposal. 

(2)	In evaluating price, the Government?s concern is to determine whether:

(a)	It reflects the offeror?s understanding of the project and ability to successfully organize and perform services as required by the contract.

(b)	It is reasonable when compared to similar efforts and the Government?s estimate.

(c)	It is compatible with the proposal?s scope and effort.  Price should be neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished.  Unrealistically high or low prices may be grounds for eliminating the proposal on the basis the offeror does not understand the requirement.

(3)  FEMA intends to give ?local preference? to those offerors that provide a preponderance of documentation that supports that they are ?residing or doing business in TX? IAW FAR 52.226-3.


c.  EVALUATION RANGE

1.	Offerors should note that in accordance with FAR 52.212-1, entitled "Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items," the Government intends to award a contract on the basis of initial offers received without discussion.  Offerors should therefore ensure that their initial proposal contains their best offer from both a price and technical standpoint, with sufficient information and documentation to enable the Government to fully ascertain each offeror?s capability to perform all services required by the solicitation, and should not assume that discussions will be conducted.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be in the Government?s best interest.

2.	In the event discussions become necessary, the Contracting Officer may determine that the number of proposals that would otherwise remain in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted and may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.


d.  BASIS FOR AWARD

The Government will award one agreement to multiple offerors resulting from this solicitation to the offerors meeting or exceeding the acceptability for Evaluation Factors (1) Scenario, (2) Past Performance and (3) Management Team, and they have the lowest offered evaluated price.

   
 4.  COMMUNICATIONS/QUESTIONS

For the D&P acquisition the NAICS code that will be utilized will be 541710 with a size standard of 1,000 employees.  On Day 2, 29 Jun 06, one-on-one discussions will be held with interested potential prime contractors. This two (2) day Industry Day meeting will be held at The Aerospace Corporation, Bldg A-8 basement auditorium(to be scheduled), 2350 East El Segundo Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice. 

A 1st Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) for TSAT Space is scheduled to be released in Sep 06, a 2nd DRFP in 1QFY07, and a final RFP in 3QFY07.  This will be followed by a full and open competition for the D&P phase with proposals due in 3QFY07, a selection of a single contractor in 1QFY08, and a first launch in FY14.  The Government expects three more industry days before the final RFP release, after the 1st and 2nd draft RFP releases and following Systems Design Review (SDR), Sep 06, Dec 06 and Mar 07, respectively.


To help meet TSAT Block 1 and 2 deployment schedules, the TSAT Program Office is soliciting 1) acquisition approaches and potential award fee incentives to reduce risk and increase confidence in systems performance and in the program cost and schedule; 2) lessons learned and best practices; 3) system integration initiatives; and 4) feedback on the program risks, candidate structure for the evaluation, statement of objectives, compliance document list, contract data deliverables list, Technical Requirements Documents (TRD) and work breakdown structure (WBS).  Working copies of these documents will be released on 19 Jun 06 and made available on the TSAT Space Bidders Library.  All contractors may submit white papers to the Government that address the four areas identified in this paragraph.  In addition, as an attachment to the white paper, contractors may provide a high level MS Project schedule with no more than 100 task IDs defining key activities required to first launch. Each task should be linked with predecessors and successors, defining critical path. In addition, each task ID should have pessimistic, realistic and optimistic durations attached.  In general, task durations should fall into a range of 1 to 6 months although there can be exceptions.

All interested parties are invited to attend Day 1 when the government team will present program overview and objectives, the acquisition strategy, system and segment requirements, and required interaction with the other segments.  The TSAT Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) segment will brief on the system requirements and TSAT Mission Operations System (TMOS) segment will brief the status of TMOS acquisition.  Day 2 will be used to meet individually with potential prime contractors who formally request a one-on-one session with the Government.  These potential prime contractors are required to submit the above mentioned white paper along with a separate list of discussions questions for the one-on-one session, along with a statement of capability requirements.   The Government will only provide information during these sessions that is equally available to all interested parties.  Following Day 2, the collective answers provided during the one-on-one sessions will be posted on the MILSATCOM TSAT Space Bidders Library website.  The white paper and questions should be less then twelve (12) pages and be submitted not later than 1200PDT on 26 Jun 06.  All discussion questions shall be submitted to SMC/MCK (Space Segment), 483 N. Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245-2808, Attn: Lakisha Jefferson, Contracting Officer.  Discussion questions should be marked appropriately.  Each portion marked proprietary or competition sensitive must include sufficient justification.

For Day 1, potential prime contractors will be limited to eight (8) representatives and subcontractors limited to five (5) representatives.  For Day 2 one-on-one discussions, the prime contractor teams will be limited to ten (10) representatives.

<DESC>MODIFICATION 02

This is a modification providing questions and answers to the Solicitation Number HSCG23-06-R-ECB018.  Questions and answers are below.  

In addition, please note that all prices should be rounded to the whole dollar.

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
HSCG23-06-R-ECB018



1.	QUESTION - The 7x20LI Ice buoy calls for part #25, Lexan Dome, which then refers to drawing #120981.  That drawing does not appear on the list. What I have is #120976 and it skips to #120982.  Could a copy be posted for down load?

ANSWER - The Contractor is not required to provide a Lexan Dome for the 7x20LI buoy.  The Lexan Dome (item 25), the battery pack (item 13), and the bracket assembly (item 20) are shown on the drawing for reference purposes only.  This is stated on Page 4 of the drawing.

2.	QUESTION - The delivery schedule has a quantity column and a column marked Lo, which I assume to mean lot. The numbers of each type of buoy that can be loaded on a truck is listed. Are we to provide the cost of one flat bed truck capable of carrying 42,000# non-permitted to the listed destinations, and permitted loads to the listed destinations? These loads would be from our fab shop to that site regardless of buoy quantities providing the load is 42,000# or less. Example; ship two 8x26LR buoys and two 2CR buoys to Astoria, OR, which would be a non-permitted load at the rate we quoted for base year, clin 00047t. Please clarify.

ANSWER - For the delivery schedule, "Lo" stands for "Lot".  For the transportation CLINs 00047A - 00047X, 10047A - 10047X, 20047A - 20047X, 30047A - 30047X, and 40047A - 40047X, offerors are required to provide the cost to have one flat bed truck transport a lot of 8 foot and under buoys from their facility to the listed destination.  These shipments will not require a permit.  For these shipments the maximum number of 8 foot and under buoys (considered a "Lot") to be placed on the truck is listed in section B.9.

For the transportation CLINs 00048A - 00048X, 10048A - 10048X, 20048A - 20048X, 30048A - 30048X, and 40048A - 40048X, offerors are required to provide the cost to have one flat bed truck transport the 9 foot diameter buoys from their facility to the listed destination.  These shipments will require an oversized load permit.  For these shipments the maximum number of 9 foot buoy(s) to be placed on the truck (considered a "Lot") is listed in section B.9. (i.e. only one 9X35LWR on a truck, or only one 9X32LR on a truck, or two 9X20BR/GR/GR buoys on a truck).


Example, the shipment of two 8x26LR buoys and two 2CR buoys to Astoria, OR would require 2 shipments.  The two 8x26LR buoys would be considered 1 Lot and would be transported on one truck and the two 2CR buoys would be considered 1 Lot and would be transported on another truck.  The buoys per shipment listed in section B.9 are the maximum number of buoys to be considered 1 Lot and placed on a truck.

3.	QUESTION ? Are you expecting a bid for the entire list of items, or can we bid on specific portions of the proposal?

ANSWER ? Offerors shall provide a proposal for all CLIN items. The Government will award to one Contractor.  

4.	QUESTION - We have discovered in reviewing the drawings for the ocean buoys, that the following drawing numbers are not compatible with our viewer:  Would you please consider putting these in the same format as the others in the series that are not listed here as we were able to view these.   Alternatively, could the remaining drawings be put in a (pdf) format?

<DESC>Amendment 28 SEP 2006:  This announcement is an amendment of the performance guidelines for a prototype Acoustic Impulse Source (AIS), specified by the broad agency announcement (solicitation number N62473-06-R-3067), on 17 August, 2006.

Isotropic radiation is neither required nor desired.   The far-field radiation pattern should ensonify approximately 1/4 of a sphere, radiating from the horizontal direction upward to the vertical (90 degree), and then 90 degree in either direction.  Energy radiated downward or backward would be considered wasted or hazardous.    The specified SPL at 10-meters assumes spherical spreading loss for both pressure and impulse attributes.

Design concepts that utilize electrical sources are acceptable.

?Beam-steering? techniques to concentrate energy are acceptable.   The water volume subjected to a single pulse of constructive interference should reach an objective SPL of 255 dB.   The shape and size of the amplified region is not specified.   Such focusing designs should seek to achieve this peak pressure at the greatest possible range.

The AIS should be capable of maintaining a pulse repetition rate of 6 pulses (minimum) to 30 pulses (objective) per minute for at least three minutes.  The cycle time to replenish this pulse capability is not specified.    However, a desirable feature would be automated and rapid replenishment.   The cost and size of the replenishment system will be one criterion for design selection.   Respondents should provide a conceptual idea for replenishment that supports their design.

The maximum size of the AIS is not specified.   However, the machine?s vertical profile should not exceed (approximately) 8-ft.    The criterion for underwater maintenance is ?none? (objective) to one diver visit per month (maximum).

It is understood that the proposed AIS specifications probably exceed the pulse capability of any current acoustic system.   Construction of such a machine could involve substantial developmental risk.   Therefore, respondents are encouraged to submit an abstract even if their proposed design:  1) cannot be verified using current technology; 2) does not meet all the stated requirements.


Basic 17 AUG 2006:
This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC), Port Hueneme, CA under FAR 6.102(d)(2).  This announcement seeks to conduct with a manufacturing company development of new, unexplored technology to design and produce a high-energy underwater Acoustic Impulse Source (AIS).  Interested firms should respond with brief documentation showing the company?s ability to fulfill the requirements described below.  Qualified firms must possess the industrial and technical experience for the development of new, unexplored technology.  Only prime contractors should respond.  A list of responding prime contractors will be furnished to potential sub-contractors upon request (via NFESC).  The AIS may use any suitable process to create the desired waveform.  The intent is to attain the objective pulse attributes while exploring techniques for generating similar waveforms with different combinati9ons of peak pressure and impulse.  The general characteristics of the objective waveform at a distance of 10-meters from the source should be:  1) peak acoustic pressure of 2600-psi (265 dB); 2) absolute impulse levels of 630 psi-msec; 3) pulse widths of 1.0 to 5.0 milliseconds; 4) ability to generate multiple pulses at intervals of 2 to 10-seconds; 5) ability to generate thousands of pulses without machine failure; 6) capable of operation after 30-days of salt water immersion to depths as great as 130-ft; 7) utilize non-electric sources of power (i.e., compressed gas or hydraulics). Abstract submittals for this BAA should be made using the abstract form located at the following Internet address:  http://enviro.nfesc.navy.mil.  Click on Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Innovative Technologies and Methodologies, and follow the instructions for submitting an abstract on line.  Make a CD of the completed form and mail to:  Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center, Code OP-30 (Attn:  Dale Synnes), 1100 23rd Avenue, Port Hueneme, CA  93043.  The abstract should concisely describe the technical approach and manufacturing process, and will be evaluated according to the criteria stated in this announcement.  No additional data may be submitted for the BAA.  If additional data is submitted, it will be discarded.  Abstracts will be evaluated on their own merits and will not be evaluated against each other.  A peer review board will evaluate the abstracts based on the following criteria (listed in descending order of importance):  1) the scientific/technical merits and objectives of the abstract; 2) the contractor?s capabilities, related experience, or unique combination of these integral factors in achieving the contractor?s proposed objectives; 3) the qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the key personnel who are critical to achieving the objectives of the abstract; 4) the cost relative to the proposed scientific/technical approach.  NOTES:
1) The preceding data should be sufficient for completing the abstract form. 2) Those companies interested in participating in this BAA program must follow these instructions for abstract submission.  3) There is no commitment by the Navy either to make any contract awards or be responsible for any money expended by any contractor before a contract is awarded.  4) An eligible abstract does not guarantee a contract.  5) A contractor is required to register with the Department of Defense Central Contractor Registration (DOD CCR).  No contract award will be made to any contractor that is not registered or in the process of registering with the DOD CCR.  The DOD CCR may be reached at (888)227-2423, or WEBSITE:  www.ccr.gov.; 6) Contractors should expect a notification of receipt of the abstract by the Government within two weeks of submission.  If the contractor has not received a notification of abstract receipt, the contractor should call NFESC at the reference phone number.  7) Following review of the abstracts by a Technical Evaluation Board (TEB), contractors will be notified of eligibility to respond to the formal solicitation by the Government.  8. There are no solicitation documents apply to this BAA.  Request for a solicitation package will not be acknowledged. 9. FOR QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS BAA, CONTACT NFESC at (805)982-1020 or via this e-mail address:  dale.synnes@navy.mil.  10.  Do not call the Contracting Office for verification.  The website is not monitored nor is the abstract received by the Contracting Office.

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201, the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) program leadership will accept requests for informational briefings from interested potential offerors. The purpose of these briefings is to facilitate the exchange of information to improve the understanding of the requirements of the BAMS UAS program and Industry's ability to satisfy those requirements.  The program leadership will accept briefings up until the time the draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is approved for release by the Government, anticipated to be in the October 2006 timeframe. Additionally, the Government is planning on holding a BAMS UAS pre-solicitation conference in the Washington D.C. area in November 2006. The Government is also envisioning holding one-on-one meetings with interested prime contractors in conjunction with the pre-solicitation conference.

The Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) will provide a persistent maritime Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) data collection and dissemination capability to the fleet.  The BAMS UAS will deliver capability enabling the Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Force (MPRF) to meet the Navy's maritime ISR requirements.  BAMS UAS full operational capability will provide for up to five simultaneous orbits worldwide.  Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for the BAMS UAS is defined as one base unit with sufficient assets, technical data, training systems, and enough spares and support equipment to operationally support one persistent ISR orbit and is planned for FY14.  At IOC, the BAMS UAS missions will include, but are not limited to, maritime surveillance, collection of enemy order of battle information, battle damage assessment, port surveillance, communication relay, and support of the following missions - maritime interdiction, surface warfare, battlespace management, and targeting for maritime and littoral strike missions.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command issues this request for information (RFI) for market research planning purposes in order to compile technical and operational data for defining a potential Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Non-Developmental Item (NDI) Man-Portable TACAN system for use by the United States Marine Corps. It is mandatory that this system be COTS/NDI, currently in production and capable of obtaining certification by the FAA. 
	
	This TACAN system is intended to be employed by the MATCALS Mobile Teams of the Marine Air Traffic Control Detachments assigned to the Marine Air Control Squadron.  It will be the primary means of providing a TACAN capability for Remote Area Landing Sites, Forward Operating Bases, and Forward Area Re-arm/Re-fuel Points.  The system will principally facilitate the safe and expeditious flow of air traffic during joint or combined operations in these forward areas.  In addition, the system is required to be transportable by no more than four Marines, a single standard HMMWV, by sea, rail and air (internal and external) and roll on/off C?130 variant aircraft. The system will not require the use of Material Handling Equipment (MHE) for embark or emplacement.
	
	The system is required to provide a signal accuracy no less than + one (1) degree, be capable of FAA certification for non-precision TACAN approaches, and provide a nominal line-of-sight range of up to 200 nautical miles (nmi).  The system must be capable of being powered by field generator, shore power, or battery.  This COTS/NDI system must currently be certifiable by the FAA for Instrument Meteorological Conditions enroute, terminal area, and non-precision approach without further testing.  Both X and Y mode channel capability is required.  Compliance with MIL-STD 291C and STANAG 5034 is mandatory. 
	
	Respondents to this RFI should provide a description of their equipment to include the following information:

a. 	Physical description of the system, including weights and dimensions.
b. 	Radio line of sight capabilities with range in nautical miles and altitude in feet.
c. 	Azimuth accuracy, range accuracy, and operating frequency range.
d. 	System input power requirements and power consumption.
e. 	System reliability based on actual usage (Mean Time Between Failures, Mean Time To Repair should be provided at a minimum).
f. 	Number of aircraft that can be handled simultaneously (traffic capacity).
g. 	Environmental operating and stowage data (temperature, humidity, wind loading, and small particle intrusion protection)
h. 	Set-up and take-down times.
i. 	Deployment configurations.
j. 	List of current users that have obtained FAA certification as an enroute, terminal, and non-precision approach TACAN system.
k. 	Production lead time.
l. 	Established logistics support.
	
Submission of Information: Responses to this RFI must be submitted electronically in Portable Document Format (PDF) and delivered via email to the following addresses: bart.ludlow@navy.mil and helen.wright@navy.mil. Respondents submit information at their own risk.  Authors are encouraged to use appropriate graphics to enhance and clarify the information being submitted. The Government will not reimburse the respondent for any cost associated with information submitted and is under no obligation to award any related contract associated with this request.  Proprietary or restricted information should be marked as such and will be protected and used only for the purposes of this RFI.  This RFI does not constitute an invitation for bid or request for proposal, and no basis for claim shall arise as a result of this RFI or any contractor response to this RFI.

8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:
A)	Background
USAID?s Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible for the development and management of the U.S. Government?s assistance programs in the five Central Asian Republics.   The USAID/CAR portfolio focuses on promoting more effective and democratic governance; advancing economic reforms and expanding economic opportunities?to include energy, water and agricultural activities; and supporting social sector reforms, improving access to quality health and education services, and addressing the threat of infectious diseases (HIV/AIDS, TB, Malaria, and Avian Flu).  The USAID/CAR Mission is located in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with Country Offices in Tashkent, Dushanbe, Bishkek and Ashgabat.  The USAID/CAR office in Almaty plays the dual role of Regional Headquarters and Country Office for Kazakhstan.  To facilitate this latter role, USAID has established a staff presence in Astana, Kazakhstan.  (Note: The U.S. Embassy will transfer to Astana, which has been the official capital of Kazakhstan since 1998, in September 2006.  

The US has three strategic interests in Kazakhstan:  Security interests to achieve regional stability; economic, democracy, and social reforms to attract and sustain foreign investment and to improve opportunities for the citizens of Kazakhstan to participate openly and effectively in civic life (all of which establish long-term stability); and the development of Central Asia?s very significant energy resources.  Within this overall USG strategy, USAID assistance will focus on the goal of advancing democratic and market economic reforms.  This focus will promote the development of sustainable social services and work on solidifying Kazakhstan?s role as an economic reform leader in Central Asia in order to broaden the benefits of Kazakhstan?s economic growth and energy resources to the other countries of Central Asia.  USAID?s $20 million/year assistance program in Kazakhstan is expected to comprise the following elements: 

	1) 	Economic Sector:
 
?	Increase Trade and Investment ? Assistance to help Kazakhstan to come into compliance with the WTO and increase its trade and transit volumes.

?	Improve Economic Policy and the Business Environment ? Assistance for policy reforms to improve and increase transparency in government budget formulation, intergovernmental finance, and management of public expenditures.  Assistance to broaden economic opportunities through improving the business environment and increasing access to business information, knowledge and skills.  Assistance will also support development of electricity marketing mechanisms to facilitate regional power trade within Central Asia and specifically with South Asia power markets.

?	Improve Private Sector Competitiveness ? Assistance will support small and medium enterprise development and growth, which is vital to diversification and broadening the benefits of economic growth.

2) 	Democracy Sector:  

?	Establish & Ensure Media Freedom & Freedom Of Information ? Encourage continued government respect for freedom of association, religion and speech as well as for democratic dissent, and provide legal and other assistance to promote a supportive environment for independent media and civil society organizations.

?	Protect Human Rights ? Encourage continued government respect for freedom of association, religion and speech as well as for democratic dissent.

?	Strengthen Civil Society ? Cultivate local civic activism on key policy issues at the grassroots level; and facilitate coalition building among NGOs to become better advocates for national level policy reforms.

?	Strengthen Democratic Political Parties ? Support Kazakhstan?s efforts to implement changes in the structure of its governing systems that increase accountability and transparency, such as direct elections for local government officials.

3)  	Social Sector:   
?	Address Other Health Vulnerabilities/Enhance Health Systems Capacity ? Ensure the institutionalization and sustainability of primary health care system reforms related to financing, family medicine, evidence-based medicine, and quality primary health care.  
?	Reduce Transmission and Impact of HIV/AIDS ? Technical assistance with implementation of HIV grants from the Global Fund (GFATM), strengthening HIV surveillance, and improving blood safety systems.   

?	Prevent and Control Infectious Diseases of Major Importance ? Assist the continued expansion of the DOTS program for TB control within the penitentiary system; maintain work to achieve global targets for treatment success and case detection in selected oblasts; continuation of the multi-drug resistant TB pilot program; improve surveillance systems; and strengthen Government?s ability to respond to emerging threats.  

?	Improve Child Survival, Health, and Nutrition ? Technical assistance to improve health services for integrated management of childhood illnesses, including the development of clinical practice guidelines based on international standards and provider training.  

?	Improve Maternal Health and Nutrition ? Pilot projects on safe motherhood to demonstrate WHO-recommended strategies for decreasing maternal morbidity and mortality.  
?	Reduce Unintended Pregnancy And Improve Healthy Reproductive Behavior ? Pilot projects on improving access to family planning counseling and commodities to decrease abortion rates.

<DESC>Revised 27 Sep 2006 SOURCE SOUGHT Anniston Army Depot (ANAD) performs maintenance on both heavy and light-tracked combat vehicles and their components.  ANAD is a highly industrialized complex which performs a variety of work, including sandblasting tanks and component parts. Our sandblast ers perform highly specialized tasks and are required to work long hours, wearing protective clothing for the corresponding hazard/risk category.  Fabric should be specifically formulated from a PVC material that is both strong and durable. Fabric shall be leak-proof,  with-stand sun, heat, saltwater, and extreme pounding from sandblasting processes. Suits must withstand a minimum of 85 PSI (pounds p er square inch) and a maximum PSI 90.  Due to the ANADR Safety Standards, suits must be highly resistant to abrasion, punctures, tearing, and mildew. Suit material shall remain flexible after wearing repeatedly, and  shall not become rigid and/or cracked a fter ten calendar days of daily wearing during 12 hour shifts.  Suit shall be lightweight and comfortable while very rugged, weigh a minimum of four pounds and a maximum of six pounds. Suit shall be roomy to enable wearer to keep cool on hot days and allows him to bulk up for colder weather. These suits shall be easy-on, easy-off. Sandblasters must don and remove their suits many times each work shift.  In addition, there is a potential for serious injury or fire.  As a result, they must be able to slip into and out of coveralls in seconds.  S uit should be removable within a maximum of 30 seconds. No struggling to get into the suit or twisting and turning to remove suit, even after hours of use. Suit should be easy to clean and mildew resistant because of repeated usage. Suit shall contained reinforced seams to eliminate in the back center at the belt line to permit the use of a ventilation system.  The hole shall be minimum of  5/8  in diameter and maximum of ¾  diameter to accommodate the 50 ft. ventilation hose used at  ANAD allowing the sandblaster to utilize an air conditioning unit to stay cool in extreme heat. The suit should have a flap sewn and sealed above the hole to protect the interior when the ventilation system is not used, but to give access when needed.  Tw o snap fasteners shall be installed to secure the flap when the ventilation system is not used.  Each seam is flat-lapped and double stitched to ensure that the fabric is securely reinforced and does not tear during the 12 hour shifts and 10 to 14 days of daily wear.  Suit shall have another layer of covering sealed over the seams to prevent ripping. Suit should be a minimum of .023 and a maximum of .029 thickness +/- .002. The suit shall have no leaks or blowouts at any seam joints, including the crotch of  the suit.  Suit shall have secure fasteners to ensure complete closure of suits during sandblasting procedures. To ensure the safety of our sandblasters there will be no allowable gaps in the material at any point.  It is a critical requirement that the coating material remains flexible and provides the necessary abrasion resistance at a wide range of temperatures.  Based on the operating conditions at Anniston Army Depot, the minimum operating range must be 35-145 de grees F.   The suit shall be a one piece coverall. To provide maximum protection for the sandblaster, the front of the coverall shall be in one piece unbroken surface. To provide this solid panel, the zipper shall be moved to the left edge of the front panel. The zip per shall be a non-separating #6 chain, 26-27 long zipper covered with a flap. There will be reinforced patches of same material to the sleeves, upper legs and chest.

<DESC>The NCA Information Services Committee (NCAISC) is seeking assistance with development of a Strategic Information Systems Management Plan (SISMP).  NCAISC has been chartered to oversee and manage IM/IT resources and resource utilization throughout th e NCA.  The SISMP will be used as a strategic blueprint to guide IM/IT planning efforts for a three to five year period.  This is a critical component of our IM/IT efforts in that no such plan currently exists for the NCA; this means that current IM/IT eff orts, although meeting current needs, may not be aligned with the NCAs strategic business objectives and enterprise architecture.  Higher authority has directed that Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) in the NCA to consolidate services and operations unde r one centralized authority in order to bring about better coordination of care and cost reductions.  Development and implementation of the SISMP is critical to ensure that IM/IT projects and operations are used effectively and efficiently and are aligned with business goals.

The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing his acquisition at the request of the Office of the Secretary, Executive Secretariat, Office of Information Resource Management (S/ES-IRM). This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of TEMPEST Ricoh Secure FAXES.  S/ES-IRM supportsthe Secretary of State in her travels, both domestically and abroad. Currently, we have 8 "kits" of communications and computer equipment. One requirement isto carry a TS/SCI-rated FAX. To meet that need, we use TEMPEST Ricoh Secure FAS as in each kit. With the additional travel recently, we needto augment out supply of kits by two.  As part of the kits, we will need TEMPEST FAXES for two additional kits and for spare devices. We have surveyed the TEMPEST FAX market place and have found only the TEMPEST Ricoh Secure FAX which utilizes "plain paper." Traveling with equipment different from our standard kit would complicate our support and incur additional costs to the Federal Government. Each TEMPEST device must be scanned and baselined by the Department's Technical Security and Safeguards office. The Ricoh Secure FAX has an established baseline. If a competitor was found, the cost to establish a baseline for the new FAX would amount to more than the cost of these six FAXES. In addition, we would have to stockpile a completely different set of expendable supplies. As this is a brand name only justification no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by a brand name herein have been determine to be the only items that meet the requirements of this office. TEMPEST Ricoh Secure FAXES have undergone test, assessment and evaluation and recieved final approval from our IT Configuration Control Board. In addition, the FX has undergone scanning by IRM/TSS to define a baseline for emanations and has been approved by TSS for use.

C)  Seller is providing these products via HP authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full  HP warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. Additional hardware will be for a redundant SAN Solution, increasing SAN Storage space, and A/EX/IRM stock to include replacement PC’s. BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION         The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet A/EX/IRM’s Network Lifecycle Replacement project needs. The HP DL380 G5 server and components meet the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: • Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management • Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health • Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks • Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives • Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers • Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) • CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting • 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives • Systems must have front video/USB ports • Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources • Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally. BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION 2        As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. A/EX/IRM has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements. The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration. The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Administration Configuration Control Board and will be added to the HW Baseline. The HP DL380 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION 3 As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. A/EX/IRM has selected the HP SB DC7600 workstation because results obtain by A/EX/IRM in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ workstations indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s requirements. The requested workstations will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration. The continued use of HP workstations eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements. The HP SB DC7600 workstation has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Administration Configuration Control Board and will be added to the HW Baseline. The HP SB DC7600 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.

Bids must be valid for 30 days after close of competition. No Exceptions or Qualifications. This justification and approval is for a name brand justification for Shavlik software.  The use of name brand is essential to the Government’s requirements for Department of State DS patch dissemination and security compliancy.  The Bureau of Diplomatic Security for the Department of State has a requirement to ensure all workstations in the DS environment are patched and inventoried.  This includes the capability to report on security patch compliance, SW inventory and apply patches to other than Microsoft applications and operating systems. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) and (d)(1)(B)in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development of a major system when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in (i) substantial duplication of cost to the Government which is not expected to be recovered through competition, or (ii) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the DS's needs. The regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements Shavlik has been tested against Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) and Window System Update Server (WSUS).  While these products provide patch dissemination and reporting on Microsoft patches, it is imperative that DS be capable to apply other than Microsoft patches and also supports other operating systems (i.e. Unix).  Shavlik has the capability to automate the scanning of today's most widely used platforms and products including Windows NT *, XP, 2000, Windows Server 2003, Exchange, SQL Server, Outlook, Microsoft Office, Java Virtual Machine, non-Microsoft product support such as WinZip, Apache and more. Shavlik also has a hierarchical security capability.  This allows certain personnel to push patches, while only allowing others to generate reports or check compliance.DS evaluated Shavlik against the existing implementations of SMS and WSUS to ensure that the services offered were complimentary to the other products, as well as, provided a check and balance to the reporting received from these products.

Statement of Work
For
AFJROTC PT Program: 
The Extreme Excellence Challenge
September 2006

1.	GENERAL INTRODUCTORY INFORMATION

1.1	Scope:  This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the effort required for the design, development, evaluation, and delivery (electronic and CD) of curriculum materials for the Extreme Excellence Challenge (E2C)--Wellness Program. 

1.2.	Introduction:  The E2C?Wellness Program is now an official part of the AFJROTC Curriculum.  It is instrumental in the AFJROTC mission of ?Develop Citizens of Character, Dedicated to Serving Their Nation and Community?.  Wellness is a critical part of citizenship.  Classrooms are full of obese and overweight kids; these students greatly limit their future capabilities and opportunities.  HQ is building a wellness program for use in the classroom with minimum resources that will use body weight and calisthenics as the core facets.  We want to enhance the basic exercise format with supplemental lesson plans to include active, fun, team-building activities.  There are approximately 945 JROTC schools nation wide that will participate in this program.

1.2.1.	The E2C-Wellness Program 19 exercises are: V Sit Reach, Bent Knee Push-ups, Feet Elevated Push-Ups, AFJROTC Push-ups, Plank, Left Arm and Right Arm Planks, Sit-ups, Extended Sit-ups, Flutter Kick, Lunges, Arm Extended Lunges, Reverse Arm Extended Lunges, Mountain Climbers, AFJROTC Squats, Body Builders 8 Count, Tuck Jumps, Side Lateral Jumps and the 1 Mile Run

	1.2.1.1.   Exercise Descriptions: Students will be timed on each of the events. The amount of repetitions they are able to perform will be documented and compared to AFJROTC standards.

V-SIT REACH (FLEXABILITY TEST)
With your shoes off, place feet eight to 12 inches apart on a line marked on the floor.  This is the baseline, which will be crossed by a measuring line that will be used to measure flexibility.  Clasp thumbs so hands are together with palms facing down, then place them on the measuring line.  Have a partner hold legs straight and keep toes facing upward. While reaching forward, exhale, and reach as far as you can while staying in good position.  

BENT KNEE PUSH-UPS (1 Minute)
 Kneel on floor and bend knees so that you pivot on your knees rather than on your toes when doing a standard pushup. When you go to the ?down? position, your feet should be in the air.  Your knees act as a fulcrum.  It is recommended that these be done on grass or with a towel, etc, to protect ones knees.  





PUSH-UPS (1 Minute)
Place your hands slightly wider than shoulders; keep torso straight and head aligned with spine throughout the exercise. Lower yourself until your chest touches the floor; press back to starting position. You must rest in the up position.

FEET ELEVATED PUSH-UPS (1 Minute)
Place feet on sturdy chair about 2 ft. tall. Perform standard push-up.  Make sure body stays straight!

AFJROTC PUSH UP (1 Minute)
Start with your hands on the floor, shoulder-width apart.
Your feet are on the floor (no knees) and your legs are shoulder width or wider, depending on you?re flexibility. Starting position is butt in the air, head looking back to your heels.
Bend your elbows and lower your body in a circular arc, until your arms are straight. Your
chest is up and your hips are almost touching the ground. Look to the ceiling. Inhale.
Push back toward your heels once again. Straightening your arms and stretching your legs, as in step #3. Exhale. Back to the same position as described in step #4. Do as many repetitions as you can.

Note: Some people lack the strength to do a single AFJROTC pushup when they begin. If you fall into this category, not to worry, you can start with an isometric AFJROTC pushup. Get into the start position and press your hands into the ground as hard as you can. Hold for six seconds while you make the "sssss" sound. After six seconds, move into the arched position. While looking skyward, flex and contract your body and push your hands into the ground. Hold for six seconds while making the "sssss" sound. Repeat this entire sequence three times. These isometric presses will give you strength very quickly and soon you'll be doing a full AFJROTC pushup.

PLANK 
Position yourself on the floor by resting on your toes and elbows. Keep you back straight.  You should look like your in a push-up position, but you are leaning on your elbows instead of your hands.  Hold this position as long as you can. No movement, just hold that plank position ... keep holding.

LEFT AND RIGHT ARM PLANKS 
These are one-armed planks.  Lay straight on your side with you legs and feet together.  Now elevate yourself onto one elbow.  You should be supporting your weight with a single forearm running perpendicular to the front of your body.  Place your opposite hand on your hip so that the non-weight supporting arm has its elbow pointing up into the air.  Now hold this position as long as you can.  You can spread your feet a bit to help with balance.  This is a side plank.  For training purposes, a student can rotate while in the one arm plank position ? meaning that you role your body while leaning on the one elbow.  Try to turn enough so that the elbow of the arm not supporting your weight goes parallel with the floor while keeping your hand on your hip.  Repeat as often as desired.  Please note that the national charts are based on one-arm plank times and not on rotations.




SIT-UPS (1 Minute)
Lie on your back with legs bent 90 degrees at the knee - the standard "sit-up" position. Cross your arms and place your hands so that your fingertips touch your shoulders.  Curl your torso so your chest moves toward your knees.  Keep your hands on your chest at all times.  The sit-up does not count if your hands come off your chest. You must rest in the up position and cannot lean on your knees while resting. One?s hips or buttock should not come off the ground to produce momentum.

EXTENDED SIT-UPS (1 Minute)
Lie down on your back and extend your arms straight by your head while on the floor. Keep your legs straight and your feet together. Keeping your arms straight, gently bring your arms over your head and toward your legs as you do a sit-up maneuver. Don't fling or yank your arms. This could cause an injury. As your torso goes upright, keeping your legs straight, elevate your legs as you do the sit up maneuver.  Your hands should eventually touch your ankles.  When your hands touch your ankles, your feet should be at least 12 to 24 inches off the floor.  Returning to the start position counts as one repetition...

FLUTTER KICKS (1 Minute)
Back Flutter Kicks are a great way to strengthen your hip flexors. Back Flutter Kicks are a traditional and staple PT exercise. Start kicking. Keep your range of motion between six inches to 36 inches max. It's a four-count exercise; one, two, three, ONE. One, two, three, TWO. One, two, three, THREE. And so on.

LUNGES (1 Minute)
Start by standing in a normal upright position with your hands on your hips.  While keeping your hands on your hip, step out far enough with your left leg so that your right knee has to drop within an inch of the floor. Now step back to the upright position and then step out with your right leg until your left knee is an inch off the floor.   Going from left to right one time equals one ?three count? lunge.  However, for testing one may count each lunge individually, so the process described above would equal two lunges. 

ARM EXTENED LUNGES (1 Minute)
Follow the same process above but do not stand in place.  Rather as you take a lunge, you also take a step from your start location.  In addition, put your arms out straight in front of you.  As you take the lunges, move both arms, while keeping them straight at the elbow, to the side of the leg that is taking the step.  So if I step out with my left leg, my arms are swinging to my left side, etc.  This works the torso in conjunction with the lunges.  

REVERSE ARM EXTENED LUNGES (1 Minute)
Do what is described above but while walking backwards. On this exercise the leg you step back with will be the leg whose knee will drop to an inch off the floor.

AFJROTC SQUAT (1 Minute)
Begin with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes pointing straight ahead. Your hands are pulled in tightly to your chest. Inhale. Keep you back fairly straight and lower your buttocks until your thighs are parallel to the floor. As you lower your buttocks your hands are BEHIND your back, and they follow you toward the ground. As you move toward the parallel-to-the-ground position, you should simultaneously raise your heels from the floor. Now swing your arms upward and push off your toes, raising your body to a standing position. Now swing your arms upward and push off your toes, raising your body to a standing position. Once you have reached the up-position, you pull your arms in toward your chest again, as if you are rowing a boat. Make tight fists with your hands and pull. Your elbows will be close to your body as you pull. Inhale as you pull your arms in, exhale as you lower yourself. Repeat without stopping for as many reps as possible. In the beginning, depending on your condition, you will be able to do 25-50. When you can do 100 without stopping, you're making great strides.

MOUNTAIN CLIMBERS (1 Minute)
Go into a regular push-up position, but extend your left leg forward so that your left knee is tucked up close to your chest.  This will be the official start position. You will then move your left leg back to a straight position while you bring your right leg up to where its knee is tucked up under your chest.  You will repeat this process and count each leg forward as one full mountain climber.  The E2C standard chart for ?mountain climbers? is based on individual knee forward counts and not the three-count method.

BODY BUILDERS ? 8 COUNT (1 Minute)
Start in a standing position with your arms to your side and your feet together.
Squat down and bend over so that you are in a squat position with your arms extended out before you and resting on the floor.  (Count to ?one? on this move.)
Kick your legs out from under you so that you go to a standard push-up position. (Count to ?two? on this move.) While in the push-up position, kick your legs apart so that your legs form a wide ?V?. (Count to ?three? on this move.) Bring your legs back together and return to the standard push-up position. (Count to ?four? on this move.) Once back in a push-up position, perform one standard push-up. (Count to ?five? on the downward move and count to ?six? on the upward move in the push-up.) While keeping your arms on the floor in front of you, tuck you legs up underneath you so that you return to the squat position described in line ?2? above. (Count to ?seven? on this move.)

ATTACH: BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION for MATLAB


Brand Name Justification for MatLab
1. AFRL/VA has a requirement far additional concurrent licenses of MathWorks
MatLab and associated MatLab toolboxes. The MatLab Engineering Support
Software Package will include re-instatement, maintenance. technical suppart.
upgrades and software documentation.
This memorandum identifies the MatLab requirement, as well as the unique
characteristics that necessitate the purchase oE MatLab per EAR 8.405-
7(a) ( 4 ) (iii), FAR 11.104 and 11.105.

2, This procurement is a sole source requirement IAW FAR 6.302-1 to The
Mathworks. Inc. of Natick, MA. The MathWorks, Inc of Natick MA, is the only
known source that can satisfy the government's requirements in accordance
with FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or
services can satisfy agency requirements." MathWorks Inc is the designer,
developer, manufacturer, and the only seller of MatLab engineering suitc of
tools that can provide the technical support, upgrades and documentatlon
required by the government.

3. The MathWorks MatLab software package and its related toolboxes provide a
collection of proven and efficient numerical methods for solving wide-ranging
problems in mathematics, science, and engineering. For example, the MatLab
program together with the Simulink toolbox has proven itself especially
useful for modeling control systems. Researchers in AFRL/VA also use MatLab
to solve optimization problems in fields such as morphing technologies. In a
broader sense, HatLab serves as a mathematical sandbox within which new ideas
can be quickly explored and matured.

4. HatLab is an essential tool for the scientists and engineers (ShEsi in
AFRL/VA. Without access to MatLab and MatLab toolboxes, researchers in
AFRL/VA would need to develop and maintain software tailored to specific
problems of interest. This would be extremely costly and labor-intensive.
Furthermore, because MatLab is widely used in academia and industry, access
to MatLab is required to collaborate with outside organizations.



5. Market research has been done to examine the alternatives to MatLab.
There are very few software packages available that are even similar to
MatLab, and none of these provide the specialized capability of MatLab. In
addition to the capabilities of the basic software, HatLab is unique in the
highly specialized tools provided through its toolboxes. VA will continue to
monitor the market to determine the existence of other potential sources to
meet future similar procurement requirements.

6. This procurement will not be synopsized in accordance with FAR
5.Nf.3) (11).

<CONTACT>Richard G Macklin Contract Specialist 303-504-2685
<DESC>This contracting activity proposes to negotiate sole source with Fresenius USA Marketing Inc., Lexington, MA.  The purchase will be negotiated sole source based on most efficient organization criteria and as there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; therefore, full and open competition is determined inappropriate for this acquisition. This requirement is to provide 2 Fresenius Model 2008K dialysis machines and ancillary devices.  The ancillary devices enable the machines to be used in the critical care area and for Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT).  The dialysis equipment is provided on a commercial basis, but the only source of this specific brand of equipment is Fresenius USA Marketing, the offeror and incumbent contractor.  No other sources can provide the Fresenius 2008K model dialysis equipment. The requesting official has stated that this specific system is necessary because the Denver VA Medical Center already possesses and uses 14 Fresenius model K and 3 Fresenius model H systems for dialysis procedures, including 2 H systems used for CRRT, and that operation of these systems required specific training for both the Hemodialysis Unit staff and critical care nurses who use the same systems in the SICU and MICU.  The 2 model H units used for CRRT are old and becoming unreliable, and require replacement in the near future. The Contracting Activity will consider offerors' quotations submitted by 10/11/2006.

Information can be found at www.ccr.gov FOB DESTINATION SHIPPING Line Items 13, 81, 91, 92 ; The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, Overseas Installations Branch (IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Transition Brand media converters and chassis.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.   IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL has identified the Transition media converters and chassis as key components of the Department’s networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State’s enterprise network cabling infrastructure based on compatibility with existing Transition media converters and chassis installed at multiple U.S. Foreign Missions and the standardization of warehouse management, bills of materials issuance, and successful installations and subsequent converter replacements.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Transition Media Converters are necessary for installation and replacement into Transition media converter centers (chassis); other brands of converters are not compatible with each others’ chassis’.  Using other brand name media converters would require restocking the warehouse with other brand name chassis’ to accommodate the other brand name converters.  Simple one-for-one replacement would not be practical as it may entail a completely new chassis and multiple media converters at one or more locations, for example, all that may be required is to add a media converter, this would not be possible if the media converter is a different brand than the existing chassis and media converters.

Using other brand name fiber optic connectors, adapter panels, and rack mount enclosures would require restocking the warehouse with the same other brand fiber optic connectors, adapter panels, and rack mount enclosures and subsequent replacement of the entire warehouse stock of existing compatible items.  Simple one-for-one replacements or additions as needed would not be practical as it may entail a completely new cabling distribution system at one or more locations.

BIDS MUST BE VALID FOR 30 DAYS AFTER COMPETITION CLOSE. FOB DESTINATION CONUS This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of purchasing a High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government¿s requirements in regard to contractual obligations concerning the lease and building property management office¿s approval of the installation of the High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System in SA-34, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. Equipment listed above is required to provide maximum warehousing capabilities in a limited space to support the Department of State¿s enterprise network distribution systems installations, modifications, and moves worldwide. The Installations Branch has painstakingly complied with Boston Properties requirements with regard to the National Office Systems¿ High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System as designed for this specific government leased location. IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL presented a design for a High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System for SA-34 (7374 Boston Blvd, Springfield, VA) to Boston Properties Management Office for approval as a modification to a building or office space managed by Boston Properties on May 5, 2006. Because Boston Properties has approved the original design submittal; there are Fairfax County Building Permits to obtain and County Codes to adhere to; and the lengthy process and inspection procedures involved with the installation of a High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System ¿ the National Office Systems¿ High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System should be purchased as currently approved by Boston Properties. The purchase of a nearly comparable rolling warehouse rack system or substitute may be cause to restart the approval process from the beginning and delay the county permit issuance and inspection processes.

The GITM Program recommends a brand name procurement of the following equipment: 	Part Number		Description 	WS-2960-24TC-L	Cisco 2960-24TC-L Switch 	WS-2960-48TC-L	Cisco 2960-48TC-L Switch 	WS-3560-48TS-E	Cisco 3560G-48TS-E Switch The Cisco Switches and Components have been identified as a key component of the Department of State infrastructure.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the Department of State network requirements. To ensure compatibility with existing network components in the field, the switches must be a Cisco model and provided by a Cisco reseller.  IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Cisco equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as a key component of the Department’s networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State’s enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that requires two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).   Per FAR 8.405-6 (e) (1), this acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.

The following FAR clauses in paragraph (b) of FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, will apply: 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34.

The software provider is to provide server based multi-voting OCR software, technical support via telephone and Web, software upgrades and new releases The Bureau of Human Resources purchased the PrimeOCR server software as a custom software application to allow the US Department of State’s promotion boards application to create PDF Image + Hidden Text files from current imaged TIF files. Follow-on annual maintenance is required to provide the Bureau authorized licensing, support and updates to the software. The maintenance support and licensing authorization remains with Prime Recognition of Woodinville, WA. The HR Bureau's Integrated Personnel Management System (IPMS) is utilized throughout the Department to manage all human resource requirements, worldwide.  The major components are the Global Employees Management System (GEMS), HR Online, the HR Bureau Knowledge Center, and the Post Personnel System.  As part of HR Online, the promotion board’s online application is used by Department of State HR/PE board members each year to review Foreign Service candidates for possible promotion. Many of the features used by Adobe Acrobat by board members require images to be in PDF Image + Hidden Text format. The PrimeOCR application by Prime Recognition facilitates that conversion to this format. Considering the importance of the promotion board’s online application to the Department of State, HR/EX feels the software fee and maintenance fee is fair in comparison to processing PDF images under the old ad-hoc workstation process.  HR/EX considers HR Online and its applications as a mission critical element to supporting the Bureau’s program in support of the Department worldwide

CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. REMEDY AUTHORIZED SELLERS ONLY.  MUST BE ABLE TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION OF AUTHORIZATION FROM REMEDY. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Remedy licenses.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.  CA/CST/DO needs programming capability to implement the new Remedy system.  These software development licenses will be used to create a developmental/test environment for the ARS-DO implementation of the Remedy ITSM products suite.  As well as creating a separate development/test environment for ARS-DO Remedy, these licenses will also allow the DO-Training team to train users using a mirror image of the current product database without impacting the production dataset. The value enhancement of a development environment is the ability to leverage additional features and functionality of the BMC Remedy product line.  Additionally, the environment can be torn down and rebuilt with an exact replica of production environment resources at any time without affecting the productions environment. (4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. (4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. The project team has received a dedicated server intended for use as a development and testing server.  It has been configured and is currently using temporary demo licenses obtained from BMC.  These temporary licenses allow DO to utilize the server for development and testing on the implemented ITSM modules until the purchase of development licenses is completed.  Development and training on the remaining modules cannot be performed in the system’s current state.  Using the dedicated server, the project team will apply the development licenses, which will provide the ability to perform development and testing activities for all ITSM modules in an isolated environment.  The development environment will mirror the production environment in every aspect possible.  Changes made in the development environment can be: ·	Duplicated in the production environment which will be the case with successfully tested and approved changes ·	Rolled back in the case of failed changes, unapproved changes, and after each training session to reset the databases, allowing the next training session to be conducted 	Separating the development from the production environment is an industry best practice.  The greatest benefit of the development environment will be that all changes that might cause a service disruption are isolated. Additionally, if developmental efforts have to be performed in the production environment, DO’s Remedy ITSM suite would be significantly impeded. Support Contract ID:  32102

Information can be found at www.ccr.gov FOB DESTINATION SHIPPING This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of EMC Symmetrix DMX801 and EMC Brocade DS4100B-24 24-Port Switch.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IV&V has a need for equipment that will provide a small scale replica of the current Consular Consolidated Database configuration. This need is based on IV&V's task to test all CA applications and systems prior to deployment. There are tools that this configuration (the DMX802 and 24-Port Brocade Switch) offers that is unique to any other equipment that may be used to support Oracle 10g RAC because it offers the same technology as the DMX3000 in production but in a very small and cost effective package. The DMX801 provides the same functionality including command line interface. Deployment strategies for the IV&V environment will therefore mirror the production environment, hence nothing will be missed during IV&V testing. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The EMC SAN and Brocade switch are required to effectively model the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) for purpose of testing database configuration and associated end-user software applications.  This hardware is being evaluated as follow-on replacements for the current testing platform of IBM servers and backup solution.  The EMC SAN and Brocade switch will allow timely shifting between database test configurations that other backup solutions cannot provide, through snapshots of the entire CCD Test Region (totaling close to 800 Gigabytes of data). The EMC Symmetrix DMX801 and EMC Brocade DS4100B-24 24-Port Switch have undergone test and assessment and will receive final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.

SELLERS MUST BID WITH SPECS AND CONFIGURATION OF LINE ITEM 001 & 002 AS OUTLINED IN ATTACHED XL SPREADSHEET. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Server have been identified as key components of the Department’s networking system, with optimal server configurations to meet CA/CST/VCS’ Diversity Immigrant Visa Information System (DVIS) project’s needs.  Currently CA is upgrading the OS and Oracle in preparation for the next releases of DVIS 05.03.00; therefore, this is an opportune time to refresh the DVIS server environments with the new servers.  The HP ML570 G3 meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: ·	Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health. ·	Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks. ·	Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives. ·	Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers. ·	Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) ·	CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting. ·	1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives. ·	Systems must have front video/USB ports. ·	Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources. ·	Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant ML570 G3 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The server has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. A)	Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via HP authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full  HP warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.

5.    APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY:  Mercom Recorders are designed to meet the needs of a wide 
       range of voice recording applications in dispatch centers that are equipped with the Positron Life Line
       100 Controller.  The Positron Life Line 100 is currently being used in the Emergency Communications 
       Center on Seymour Johnson AFB.  This system will allow for automatic playback for Emergency Communications Center dispatchers.

Line Item 0001;  QTY 31 sets SIB broom cassettes (part# SIB/MB-18/28-05). The intended source of this requirement is Myslik, Inc., as this is the only authorized dealer of SIB Broom Cassette in North America.  The SIB core comes with nylon inserts designed to absorb all the wear that the extrusions have incurred with replacement cost being a fraction of that expense.  Nylon insert replacement is now required and is available on the new SIB core which has a five year warranty.  In order to maintain the 5-year warranty for these cores, SIB cassettes must be used with these cores.  Use of other brands would void the warranty and cause excessive wear to the core.

SUBJECT:  Brand Name (F1S0AX6234B002)

1.	The Electronic Warfare (EW) Directorate requests the Brand Name of four (4) EMI Test Receivers, four (4) removable Hard Disk (Falsh Card) Operating System WinXP, four (4) 2nd Hard Disk (Flash Card) for ESU-B18, four (4) Time Domain Scan FFT based scan for fast overview measurements.

2.	The ESU40 EMI Test Receivers will be used for typical customer test objectives at the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF) requiring radio frequency (RF) measurements at multiple positions outside the test article and/or from multiple installed antennas with high frequency data point resolution.  Prior to testing, it is also required that the measurement system accuracy and setup be verified.  With the increase testing in recent years, equipment availability for pre-test verifications and dryruns has not been sufficient.  The use of four identical measurement systems allows for reduced test time from taking parallel measurements, simplified automation software, and consistent data products from each measurement system.  Attempting to use any other model would not allow for that reduction in test time and the parallel measurements as required.  The salient functional characteristics that are essential to the Electronic Warfare Directorate are as follows: 

?	EMI Test Receiver, Spectrum Analyzer and Real Time Analyzer in one box
?	Compliant to CISPR 16-1-1 and FCC (commercial and automotive standards)
?	EMI Receiver and Spectrum Analyzer Modes
?	Fully compliant to MIL-STD-461 A-E and DO-160 (military and aerospace standard)
?	Internal preselection is standard and is a key difference between ESU and its competitors.  The preselector can be used or switched off in analyzer mode.
?	Time domain analysis:  Click rate analyzer, specialized FFT
?	50MHz RBW option
?	External Source Controller
?	Pulse protected RF input
?	WinXP operating system
?	Detectors:  Mil-Std
?	Settable sweep point values:  155 to 30,001
?	Portable (~35 lbs)
?	Sweep speed:  150 kHz-30 MHz = 22 sec, 1-18 GHz = 3.4 sec
?	3dB filter shape resolution bandwidths
?	10 MHz resolution bandwidth or greater
?	Custom internal correction factors over frequency
?	Minimum 60,000 data points per trace
?	40 GHz RF measurement capability
?	Removable hard drives and approved declassification    process for internal memory
?	GPIB and Ethernet control
?	USB Ports


3.The key unique capabilities are:  Both receiver mode and spectrum analyzer mode, 2 million data points per trace in receiver mode, 30,001 data points per trace in analyzer mode, MIL-STD-461E resolution bandwidths using 6dB filter bandwidth shape, and removable hard drives for security.  


4.If you should have any questions feel free to contact either myself ROBERTA J. RUNDLE, NH-III  Acquistion & Contracts Branch,
at 277-8651 or Dave Mulvey at 7-5744.

Questions and Answers are posted below Bid closeout remains as 29 Sept 06, 12 noon EST:

SOW #1 ? Mission Statement to be provided ? Has this been created by individuals in your organization or another already?
 Determined by MEO; mission statement encircled with various photos
Contractor built cases ? the sizes have ??? marks after the dimensions. Is this an error instead of putting the inch symbol or is the size subject to variation?
 ? mark is an error, should be inch signs "
Will the color of the blue laminate be determined by you or has a specific laminate blue been determined and if so what is the manufacturer name and color number?
 Color of laminate is to be determined by MEO with contractor expertise
Artifacts- can you provide a further explanation on the term used ?very little artifacts?. It is certainly ambiguous in terms of the dimensionality or the quantity of the items. Which is the correct explanation? Furthermore, do you have digital images that will be available to the successful contractor since they will be placed in the case prior to shipment at your location?
 No digital images, number of artifacts are to be supplied by the contractor, number to be determined by MEO and contractor
