<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for 60 ELECTROCHEMICAL CONCENTRATION CELL (ECC) OZONESONDE INSTRUMENTS WITH RADIOSONDES LITHIUM BATTERY AND INTERFACE CABLES COUPLED INTO THE ECC OZONESONDE. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from  ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE CORPORATION, who is the only responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisify agency requirements.  The instruments will be used to monitor atmospheric ozone and other trace species to better understand climate change. ECC instruments available from other companies would require significant changes to the existing ground support equipment (i.e. calibration procedures, radio receiving equipment, and data processing software). This is part of SAGE III validation plan requiring measurement comparison's in the southern hemisphere.  It would take substantial time and money  for another company to duplicate these components and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing (PHONE CALLS ARE NOT ACCEPTED) to Ms. Terry Cobb, NASA/LaRC, M/S 126, Hampton, VA 23681; fax number 757-864-6966, not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on JUNE 28, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not  acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<ARCHDATE>09282002
<CONTACT>Major Mark I.  Wade, Contracting Officer, (781) 377-5541
<DESC>Notification of Contract Action (NOCA).  This FedBizOps (FBO) announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) for a proposed contract award to Northrop Grumman PRB Systems for RainDrop software.  The USAF has an immediate requirement for a Precise Positioning Tool to satisfy warfighter Time-Sensitive Targeting requirements.  The tool must be an off-the-shelf product compatible with the existing DTS operator workstations without modification and capable of accessing and exploiting stereo imagery from a Digital Point Positioning Database (DPPDB) tape and registering tactical imagery to the DPPDB.  The USAF is aware of only one source that can meet this requirement.  ESC/SRK intends to award a contract during June 2002 to purchase RainDrop software licenses, stereo goggles, training, security accreditation and installation support.  RainDrop is a photogrammetric tool that can be used to locate and measure features in a stereo image pair and output these measurements for use in other programs. RainDrop can display stereo images using shuttered glasses and a stereo- capable monitor/video card. RainDrop's primary source of stereo imagery is NIMA's Digital Point Positioning Database (DPPDB). An interface lets users access and exploit stereo imagery from a DPPDB tape, and record resulting positional information. RainDrop can also use DPPDB data from a server. RainDrop can import National Technical Means (NTM) data and register this imagery to the DPPDB. RainDrop supports NITF, DXF, SUN Raster and TIFF formats. Tactical imagery from all U2 , Predator, and Global Hawk sensors can be imported and registered to the DPPDB. In addition to precise coordinates, RainDrop can produce target detail reports. These reports include names, locations and types of features created during a session, along with their coordinates and associated accuracies.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2),"Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.   An Acquisition Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during proposal development.  You should only contact the Ombudsman with issues or problems you cannot satisfactorily resolve with the program manager and/or contracting officer.  The Ombudsman role is to hear concerns, issues, and recommendations and communicate these to the appropriate government personnel.  The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality if desired.  The Ombudsman does not evaluate proposals or participate in source selection.  ESC's Acquisition Ombudsman is Colonel Joseph P. Maryeski, Director, Commander's Staff, ESC/CO, (781) 377-5106 or email at joseph.maryeski@hanscom.af.mil.  See Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for X-Ray Diffraction System Upgrade. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Bruker AXS, Inc., as the only known source who can meet Agency needs.  This is an upgrade to Government-owned X-Ray systems, which will support all presently installed analytical capabilities.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to duplicate this effort and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 1, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications ARE NOT acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is seeking proposals to obtain the services of a contractor who has data currently available from studies worldwide that can be used to develop methods of identifying people with impaired glucose metabolism (i.e., impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose).  The methods developed should be based as much as possible on simple, non-invasive measures of health status.  The goal of this project is to develop simple and efficient criteria to identify high-risk persons eligible for further metabolic evaluation and eventually for diabetes prevention interventions. The objectives are (1) to identify individuals most likely to have IFG and IGT using simple measures that do not require a blood test and (2) to assess IGT with methods that may include a blood test, but are simpler than a glucose tolerance test.  The period of performance is 24 months.  A cost reimbursement type contract is contemplated.  Potential sources should have an existing dataset of worldwide studies to perform a meta-analysis on the association between abdominal obesity and diabetes.  All responsible sources meeting the above criteria may submit a proposal in response to the RFP.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541611, and the small business size standard is $6M.  This requirement will be done under full and open competition.  The estimated release date of the RFP on the http://www.fedbizopps.gov website is on or about July 1, 2002.  Hard copies of the RFP will not be mailed.  It is your responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding this RFP on the FedBizOpps website.  Interested parties are encouraged to use the ?register to receive notification? button at the bottom of this synopsis to receive notification when this requirement is updated.  NO TELEPHONIC REQUESTS OR INQUIRIES WILL BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to negotiate a sole-source, follow-on contract with FNH USA Inc. (Herstal).  The M3M Pintle Weapon System will be installed on three platforms.  The helicopters are the CH 46E, the CH 53E, and the UH-1N.  The weapon system includes an aircraft to pintle-head interface and ammo box to platform interface.  This M3M Pintle Weapon System is a high rate of fire machine gun with a single barrel and accurate firing.  This system contains an open bolt firing mechanism to eliminate cook-off risk, and a safety lever to avoid undesirable firing, enhanced firing control, a unique mount to reduce recoil forces and lock-in horizontal swiveling.  The M3M Pintle Weapon System has a high degree of on target accuracy in the first round and subsequent maintenance on target.  The pintle-mounted M3M delivers up to 1,100 rounds per minute.  FNH USA, Inc. (Herstal) is the only known manufacturer of this unique M3M Pintle Weapon System.  This machine gun weapon system is the only known open-bolt system to eliminate cook-off problems and is the only machine gun with this unique stabilizing mount system.  This stabilizing system includes a mount that reduces the impact of recoil so as to improve the probability of first round hit and increasing subsequent accuracy.  This system is a non-developmental item.  The system should be able to be dismounted from the helicopter and employed for ground use.  The system should not require electrical power to operate.  
 
This contract will include mounts and machine guns that will be integrated onboard the UH-1N DAS (Defensive Armament System), modification kits and systems for the right and left sides of the CH46E, CH53E, and the CH 53D helicopters, ramp kits for the CH 53E and CH 53D helicopters and bore sights for the GCP-2A/V2 IR Pointer.

<SOLNBR>N61339-02-R-0061
<ARCHDATE>06282002

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) currently is delivering Virtual Environment Submarine Shiphandling (VESUB) 2000 Trainers and Submarine Piloting and Navigation (SPAN) 2000 Trainers. These trainers use an Image Generator (IG) to produce a visual scene of a harbor waterway as if the simulated submarine were traveling on the surface.  The trainers are used for team training for piloting, navigation, contact coordination, mooring/coming alongside and tactics.  The visual scenes are viewed by the trainee via several different display systems (periscope, head mounted, etc.).  The scenes allow the periscope operators, Officer of the Deck (OOD), Contact Coordinator, Navigator, and Lookout the opportunity to pilot and navigate, using visual cues, while transiting harbors and berthing at designated piers.  For piloting and navigation, geographically correct (Lat/Long) positions of navigation aids (water and land) and the visual appearance of the navigation aids (daymarks, buoys, ranges, tanks, towers, etc) are critical.   Currently, there are five (5) databases available to exercise on these trainers.   A waterway database will contain all the key navigation aids found on the current NIMA-approved navigation chart of that portion of the waterway, including key terrain features as seen from a submarine's bridge.   The piers utilized in a particular portion of the waterway will also be modeled to train "departing from and coming along side a pier".   NAWCTSD intends to procure the following twenty-three (23) additional databases for use with the VESUB 2000 and SPAN 2000 trainers: BASE YEAR; CLIN 0001 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Bangor, WA (Straight of Juan de Fuca to Hood Canal, WA); CLIN 0002 -  Harbor/Water Way Database for Yokusuka, Japan; CLIN 0003 -  Harbor/Water Way Database for Chinhae, South Korea; CLIN 0004 - Harbor/Water Way Database for LaMaddalena, Italy; CLIN 0005 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Sasebo, Japan; CLIN 0006 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Faslane, Scotland; CLIN 0007 -  Technical Data and Information IAW Exhibits, A, B, C, D, & E; CLIN 0008 - Post-Award Conferences (PAC); OPTION YEAR I; CLIN 0101 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Bangor, WA (Straights of Juan de Fuca to Hood Canal, WA); CLIN 0102 -  Harbor/Water Way Database for Yokusuka, Japan; CLIN 0103 -  Harbor/Water Way Database for Chinhae, South Korea; CLIN 0104 - Harbor/Water Way Database for LaMaddalena, Italy; CLIN 0105 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Sasebo, Japan; CLIN 0106 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Faslane, Scotland; CLIN 0107 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Hong Kong; CLIN 0108 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Roosevelt Roads, PR; CLIN 0109 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Bahrain, Persian Gulf; CLIN 0110 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Singapore; CLIN 0111 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Rota, Spain; CLIN 0112 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Hafia, Israel; CLIN 0113 - Technical Data and Information IAW Exhibits, A, B, C, D, & E; CLIN 0114 - Post-Award Conferences (PAC); CLIN 0115 - Updates to delivered databases; OPTION YEAR II; CLIN 0201 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Bangor, WA (Straights of Juan de Fuca to Hood Canal, WA); CLIN 0202 -  Harbor/Water Way Database for Yokusuka, Japan; CLIN 0203 -  Harbor/Water Way Database for Chinhae, South Korea; CLIN 0204 - Harbor/Water Way Database for LaMaddalena, Italy; CLIN 0205 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Sasebo, Japan; CLIN 0206 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Faslane, Scotland; CLIN 0207 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Hong Kong; CLIN 0208 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Roosevelt Roads, PR; CLIN 0209 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Bahrain, Persian Gulf; CLIN 0210 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Singapore; CLIN 0211 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Rota, Spain; CLIN 0212 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Hafia, Israel; CLIN 0213 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Straights of Gibraltar; CLIN 0214 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Brisbane, Australia; CLIN 0215 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Nanoose Bay, British Columbia; CLIN 0216 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Guam; CLIN 0217 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Jebel Ali, UAE; CLIN 0218 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Phuket, Thailand; CLIN 0219 - Technical Data and Information IAW Exhibits, A, B, C, D, & E; CLIN 0220 - Post-Award Conferences (PAC); CLIN 0221 - Updates to delivered databases; OPTION YEAR III; CLIN 0301 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Bangor, WA (Straights of Juan de Fuca to Hood Canal, WA); CLIN 0302 -  Harbor/Water Way Database for Yokusuka, Japan; CLIN 0303 -  Harbor/Water Way Database for Chinhae, South Korea; CLIN 0304 - Harbor/Water Way Database for LaMaddalena, Italy; CLIN 0305 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Sasebo, Japan; CLIN 0306 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Faslane, Scotland; CLIN 0307 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Hong Kong; CLIN 0308 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Roosevelt Roads, PR; CLIN 0309 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Bahrain, Persian Gulf; CLIN 0310 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Singapore; CLIN 0311 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Rota, Spain; CLIN 0312 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Hafia, Israel; CLIN 0313 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Straights of Gibraltar; CLIN 0314 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Brisbane, Australia; CLIN 0315 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Nanoose Bay, British Columbia; CLIN 0316 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Guam; CLIN 0317 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Jebel Ali, UAE; CLIN 0318 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Phuket, Thailand; CLIN 0319 - Harbor/Water Way Database for San Diego, CA; CLIN 0320 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Portsmouth, ME; CLIN 0321 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Port Canaveral, FL; CLIN 0322- Harbor/Water Way Database for Port Everglades, FL; CLIN 0323 - Harbor/Water Way Database for Suez Canal; CLIN 0324 - Technical Data and Information IAW Exhibits, A, B, C, D, & E; CLIN 0325 - Post-Award Conferences (PAC); & CLIN 0326 - Updates to delivered databases.  The Government expects to award the Basic requirement for the initial six Harbor/Water Way Databases followed by Option exercise(s) for approximately six additional databases annually.   However, the solicitation will be structured to permit the Government to acquire more than or less than the estimated six databases per year depending on available funds.   As a consequence, the above CLIN structure provides for a total of six databases in the Base Year, those same six databases plus six new databases for a total of twelve databases in Option Year I, those same twelve databases plus six new databases in Option Year II, etc.   In view of the potential availability of existing, modifiable databases the Government will reserve the right to make a split award.  A maximum of three contracts will be awarded.   For the visual scene, both the VESUB 2000 and SPAN 2000 use Computer Science Corporation Advance Marine Center's VSHIP software.  VSHIP uses MultiGen-Paradigm's Vega application to control the models and display them visually.  The VESUB 2000 trainer runs on an SGI ONYX with the IRIX operating system and the SPAN 2000 trainer runs on a PC IG under Windows 2000.  It is a mandatory proposal requirement that any Offeror(s) interested in this requirement establish a Technical Support Agreement with Computer Sciences Corporation and sign a Non Disclosure Agreement to be provided to the Government with their proposal.  The following provides further guidance on the Technical Support Agreement and the Non Disclosure Agreement: Technical Support Agreement.  The Visual Database Development for Submarine Trainers effort will require technical assistance from Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) Advanced Marine Center, Suite 1300, 1725 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA.   Due to lack of design data and the proprietary nature of the VSHIP related harbor files (SCN file, lp file, xml file, obj file, dock file, and Centerline/Channel model), it will be necessary for prospective offerors to enter into a technical support agreement/contract with CSC.   This agreement/contract must provide for access to the documentation necessary for the offeror to produce the additional files; the training required to ensure that the files are produced in a manner compatible with VSHIP; and the necessary on call technical assistance to support debugging of developed databases or associated files if problems are encountered in running in the VSHIP environment.   Provide a copy of the signed agreement the offeror will use to obtain this technical support from CSC.  Non-Disclosure Agreement.  As noted above, the related harbor files are proprietary to CSC.  This will require the offeror to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with CSC.  This NDA shall state that the offeror cannot disclose the contents of these files to another party and that the formats would be used for government purposes only.  Provide a copy of the completed and signed NDA between the offeror and CSC. The CSC point of contact for the foregoing is Ms. Linda Criste, Contracts Manager, 1201 M St. SE, Suite 400, Washington, DC 20003, Phone: (202) 675-3315, E-mail lcriste@csc.com.  The Government will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about 1 July 2002.  The RFP, Statement of Work (SOW), and Specifications will be posted to the below website on or about 26 June 2002. Specific details about the requirement will be provided in the formal RFP N61339-02-R-0061 which will be posted on the World Wide Web at http://www.ntsc.navy.mil/Ebusiness/BusOps/Index.cfm (click on Open Acquisitions).

The proposal due date will be on or about 31 July 2002 and is expected to be awarded on or about 30 September 2002.  NAWCTSD seeks to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contract under FAR Part 6.1, Full and Open Competition.  The Government intends to award to the Offeror(s) who offers the Best Value to the Government using Trade Off Analysis.  Questions and comments on the RFP, SOW, or Specifications and any other documents posted regarding subject requirement are welcome and should be emailed to mcauliffela@navair.navy.mil and may be posted on the solicitation website.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to conduct a limited competition between Kollsman Inc., 220 Daniel Webster Highway, Merrimack, NH 03054-4844 and Israel Aircraft Industries, LTD, TAMAM Plant, P.O. Box 75, Industrial Area, Yehud Industrial Zone, Yehud, Israel, 56100 to procure two prototype upgrades which incorporate a third generation Staring Focal Plane Array Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), and improve the Boresight functionality of the U.S. Marine Corps AH-1W Cobra Night Targeting System (NTS). Additionally, engineering, testing, kit validation/verification, sustaining engineering, logistics, and technical support required (including but not limited to associated integrated logistics support, quality assurance, reliability and maintainability programs, testing, training, technical, administrative and financial data requirements) supporting the NTS upgrade will be contracted. The FLIR upgrade and Boresight improvements must be done by modification of existing AH-1W NTS government furnished equipment and require no changes to the airframe, the aircraft or human interfaces, and aircraft software (not pertaining to NTS software). The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary information/data rights owned by Kollsman and TAMAM (the only two NTS manufacturers). The government does not own complete level three drawings or data rights for the NTS. The limited competition will result in an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract with options to the successful offeror. Contract duration will be five years. See Note No. 22.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 611699 The Environmental Protection Agency under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures of FAR Part 13 intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Ms. Joel Ann Todd.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 611699.  Background: EPA's environmentally preferable purchasing  program has recently teamed up with the National Park Service (NPS)  to bring green purchasing training and tools to park staff and managers as a means of achieving NPS sustainability goals.  In March 2002, under a previous work assignment, we jointly hosted a pilot training workshop/charrette at  Big Cypress National Preserve.  This pilot workshop was evaluated by participants very highly and now NPS and EPA are interested in expanding these workshops to other parks, and in conducting targeted outreach and in providing technical information to parks on environmentally preferable purchasing.    The goal of the workshops/charrette, as it was at Big Cypress, should be to introduce the participants to the concepts of green purchasing, to demonstrate the tools and resources that are available, and to focus them in on a few product categories that EPA is trying to emphasize.  The green  purchasing portion of the training should demonstrate to the participants that greener purchasing can be used as a means to achieve the sustainability goals of a park.  The outreach and technical assistance on EPP should introduce park staff to EPP and should be developed to provide specific  information about how to buy green alternatives to commonly purchased products and services in the parks.  The outreach information should be user-friendly (easy to read and understand, with a minimum of technical jargon) and presented in a graphically pleasing way.  The proposed contract action is  for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for  competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within fifteen (15) days after the date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination not to compete with this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the  Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Statement of Work for this requirement will be available at the following EPA website by COB  06/14/02 Http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/0200181/index.htm  All questions should be directed via e-mail to the Contracting Officer.  PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  See numbered note 1.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) seeks to increase the current level of effort under Contract PBGC01-CT-02-0630.  The contract includes the analysis, development and maintenance programming of approximately 16 PBGC custom-designed software applications.  This is a continuation of work already undertaken by the existing provider.  The increase in the level of effort is to accommodate the increase in workload resulting from the recent trusteeship of several small and large pension plans which has placed unforeseen demands on the efficiency and responsiveness of PBGC systems.  In view of the provider's familiarity with the complexities of PBGC, extensive systems experience with PBGC's environment, and the time already spent in learning the work and PBGC policies and procedures, it is PBGC's belief that it would be in our best interest for the current provider to continue performing the work under the contract.  All responsible sources may submit their capabilities which will be considered by the agency in accordance with Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Government sites FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

Award to any other source will result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government.  The anticipated performance period is 188 calendar days from the Notice to Proceed.  The project will require the contractor to convert the heating and ventilation controls to a direct digital control system in Building 500 which will tie into the Base Energy Management Control System (EMCS).  The work will consist of replacing the existing controls, VAV box controls and replacing with new DDC controls and installing new airflow crosses in the inlets of each new VAV within the base wide EMCS network.  The contractor will also be responsible for providing graphics and other programming to integrate the new control system into the base central file server and workstations.  In addition, the contractor is required to provide new Variable Frequency Drives (VFD) and motors as well as balancing and commissioning the revamped system.

<CONTACT>Frank Krempa, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 482-0997, Fax (202) 482-4988, Email fkrempa@doc.gov
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) to upgrade or replace the containment booth currently used by the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) to inspect incoming mail for bio-chemical contaminants.  This is an RFI only, and shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services or product.  The Government will not pay for information received in response to this RFI, or for any costs incurred related to the submission of pricing information. There is no solicitation available at this time. 

BACKGROUND:  The DOC is currently using a temporary structure in which incoming mail is inspected for biological contaminants.  This is done in the basement of its headquarters building in Washington, DC,  where approximately 3,000 letters and/or small packages are inspected daily.  This temporary structure was constructed on an emergency basis after the Washington DC area experienced a biological attack in October 2001. The existing structure is approximately 8ft X 8 ft, and is located in a restricted access work area.  The total area available is approximately 10 ft X 32 Ft.   

The facility was intended to protect mailroom employees and building occupants by screening mail by physical examination to detect and contain possible release of any hazardous particulate contaminants.  The containment structure is serviced by a HEPA filter that also provides a  means for conducting routine bio-hazard testing. Samples of each mail delivery are then forwarded for laboratory analysis.  Mail is held for 48-72 hours until the results of these tests are provided to DOC.  While these  procedures provide safeguards, mail delivery is delayed and has become more costly.   

Requirement : The Department of Commerce is seeking a solution to provide long-term protection to employees and occupants from hazardous contaminants that could be dispersed through incoming mail.  Any solution must meet all regulations and guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, along with standard industrial hygiene ventilation commercial practices and standards for the control of airborne particles.  In addition, any recommended solution should recognize and be compatible with US Postal Service mail treatment and processing guidelines. The DOC is also interested in ways to detect and/or destroy hazardous biological spores or contaminants that may be present in trays of letter mail, small boxes or incoming mail.

NOTE: Mail handling Services at DOC are provided by a JWOD contractor who employs persons who may be disabled. The proposed solutions will need to address accessability and operability issues. 

The information submitted may include, but is not limited to, the frequency of the analysis, the method of obtaining samples for testing, methods of testing for harmful contaminants, methods of destroying chemical or biological contaminants, precautions to be taken when handling the mail, type (s) of protective equipment to be worn, and other such information.   Reducing mail delivery delays and bio-hazard protection costs are also goals of the Department of Commerce. 

A general solution, including a rough order of magnitude (ROM)  pricing is requested.  The pricing data should include warranties, maintenance, filters or other operating expenses, and testing, if part of the proposed solution, so that a total cost of use and ownership can be estimated.  Information on the submitting party's relevant experience in the area of detection and containment of hazardous contaminants should be included in the RFI response. Include references with points of contact, if applicable.  Specific information should be limited to 10 pages.  Attachments including Annual Reports and brochures are welcome, but please limit enclosures to three items.  Reference material such as CDC policy may be included and will not count against the page limitations.   Please indicate if your productsor services are available on GSA schedule. The closing date for responses has been extended until June 21, 2002.  Hard copies of material should be mailed to U.S. Department of Commerce, Commerce Acquisition Solutions, Room 6422, Attn: F. Krempa,  1401 Constitution Avenue NW,  Washington DC 20230.  Information may be forwarded electronically to fkrempa@doc.gov.    For additional information, contact the following DOC representative: Frank Krempa, Contracting Officer, by email at fkrempa@doc.gov

<DESC>The NASA Langley Research Center is hereby soliciting information from potential sources for conceptual and/or early design phase activities for access-to-space vision vehicles and hypersonic flight demonstrator vehicles, including associated technology development, system and subsystem build, integration, and test. Langley Research Center is leading the development of hypersonic flight demonstration vehicles in support the National Aerospace Initiative and NASA Advanced Space Transportation Program. Potential sources are sought with capability in three broad areas of support: 1) Systems analysis, systems engineering, conceptual and preliminary design, and system and subsystem development and ground testing of access-to-space vision vehicles and hypersonic demonstrator vehicles; 2) Airframe technology and system development; and 3) Dual-mode ramjet-scramjet propulsion and related combined cycle research and technology development.  This notice may result in a solicitation and a subsequent task order contract(s) that include tasks in the individual areas and/or tasks that cross cut these three areas. Task areas are described in more detail below.  1.  Systems Analysis, Conceptual and Preliminary Design of Access-to-Space Vision Vehicles and Unpiloted Hypersonic Flight Vehicle Demonstrators Tasks will include the system analysis and conceptual design of access-to-space vision vehicles, and conceptual and preliminary design and analysis of unpiloted flight vehicles operating up to Mach 15, some of which will require a return and land (low speed) capability.  Tasks may include early concept design through preliminary design review (PDR) level of maturity. The complete spectrum of access-to-space vision vehicles (crewed and uncrewed-cargo) and hypersonic vehicle design and analysis capability is needed.  Access-to-space vehicles will include single and multi-stage vehicles.  Tasks may include but are not limited to: definition of system architectures and vehicles that meet required missions; systems analysis of vehicles with new and advanced technologies for airframe and propulsion systems; definition of advanced ground operations and flight systems that lead to orders of magnitude improvement in cost and safety; vehicle system analysis and systems engineering and design; integration and performance assessment of low-speed and high-speed propulsion systems including turbine engines, rocket engines, ramjet and scramjet engines, and combined cycle engines propulsion system design will not be in this task); aerodynamic and rothermodynamic analysis including computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis; inlet and nozzle flowpath; wind tunnel testing (unpowered and powered) of representative models (use of NASA and DoD wind tunnel facilities is anticipated); guidance, autonomous navigation and control definition and design; thermal protection; materials selection and airframe integration; vehicle system and subsystems design including vehicle purge, fuel systems (hydrogen and hydrocarbon fuels are anticipated), structural, mechanical, thermal, power, avionics, and fuel systems; safety and hazards analyses; integrated performance analysis; vehicle reliability; crew safety; and preliminary maintenance, turn-around time and refurbishment concepts for recovered vehicles; and integration with potential launch and carrier vehicles, e.g., rockets or aircraft.  Testing will encompass all ground testing including wind tunnel tests and integrated system and subsystem tests.  Deliverables will include conceptual and preliminary design layouts; analytical models and databases; integrated performance analysis reports; preliminary aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic data bases; test and analysis reports; preliminary structural analysis; interface requirements (e.g., to the engine system and carrier vehicles for flight tests); preliminary specifications of the vehicle and subsystems, maintenance and refurbishment; reliability, safety and hazards analyses; and development and life cycle cost and schedule estimates.  The technical point of contact for this area is Mr. Rodney Ricketts, Systems Analysis Manager, r.h.ricketts@larc.nasa.gov, 757-864-1209, Langley Research Center.  2.  Hypersonic Vehicle Airframe Technology Development.   Areas of interest include structures and materials, design and analysis, test article fabrication and testing, instrumentation, integrated vehicle health management (IVHM), aerodynamics, aerothermodynamics, thermal protection systems (TPS), hot structures, leading edges, cryogenic tanks, insulations, and seals.  Tasks will include, but are not limited to, design, fabrication, and testing from coupon level to large scale integrated demonstrations, i.e. integrated tank, TPS, structure, seals, and control surfaces.   The technical point of contact for this area is Dr. David E. Glass, Hypersonics Airframe Manager, d.e.glass@larc.nasa.gov, (757) 864-5423, Langley Research Center. 3.  Dual-Mode Propulsion Technology Development for Unpiloted Hypersonic Airframe-Integrated Configurations. Areas of interest may include flowpath component analysis and testing separate or combined flowpaths (inlets, isolators, combustors, nozzles), robust nose-to-tail flowpath analysis and design methods, ramjet/scramjet flow physics and modeling capabilities, propulsion-airframe integration, mode transitions between low-speed, ramjet-scramjet and other engine cycles, flow diagnostic methods, ground testing techniques and continuous multi-speed engine operability and performance.  Products in this area may include, but are not limited to, conceptual flowpath design and performance analyses; test hardware design and fabrication; ground test planning and data analysis; and analysis and diagnostic tools. Enabling technologies, such as materials, seals and structural concepts necessary for system integration are also of interest.  The technical point of contact for this area is Mr. Charles Cockrell, Airbreathing Propulsion Program Manager, c.e.cockrell.jr@larc.nasa.gov,  757-864-5576, Langley Research Center.  Firms having the required specialized capabilities in part or all of the above requirements should submit a capability statement of 7 pages or less documenting their ability, facilities and past experience in performing similar efforts as described herein. Specifically, within the 7 pages, respondents should describe the engineering and systems analysis capabilities, design and computational capabilities, unique facilities that would be applied to these tasks, workforce that is engineering and technical (with technical qualifications), and company experience with access-to-space and hypersonic vehicles (including major subsystems), airframes and propulsion.

<DESC>The Projects Division, Precision Strike System Programs Office (WMGD) is issuing a sources sought for new or modified warhead leading to a production of approximately 350 All-Up-Rounds (AUR).  They are seeking capable sources with demonstrated past performance to accomplish this effort.  This program is scheduled to begin in FY03 with two years to design, develop, and test a new or modified warhead leading to a production of approximately 350 All-Up-Rounds (AUR) beginning in FY05.  The objective of this effort is to increase the penetration, survivability, and lethality of the current design to improve the capability in defeating hard targets.  Survivability areas to be addressed are: fuze mounting hardware, payload, and case.  The resultant warhead will be incorporated into the EGBU-28 system with minimal impact to operations and logistic support.  There will be no changes to the guidance and tail kits other than minor changes to adapters, lanyards, and other miscellaneous hardware required to accommodate potential reshaping of the warhead.  The objective is to stay within the mass properties of the existing BLU-113 warhead; however, nominal changes to mass properties may be permitted as long as those changes do not require a full flight certification program, and do not impact the guidance system.  The designated launch platforms are the F-15E and B2 aircraft and shall require no modifications to accommodate the resultant system.  Responses to this sources sought will be used by the government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  The government has developed candidate concepts for improved penetration, survivability, and lethality.  These concepts will be made available for consideration upon issuance of the Request For Proposal (RFP).  Respondents to this sources sought must submit a directly related capabilities package consisting of experience covering: warhead design and fabrication, materials technology, explosive development, weapon and aircraft integration including system logistics support.  Models and simulations required to perform the analysis effort shall be identified.  Respondants shall include a section citing contractual past performance in the above cited areas.  
THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.  This sources sought is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  This requirement excludes foreign participation.  Additionally, this acquisition will involve data that are subject to export control laws and regulations.  Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) shall be provided copies of the solicitation or other data subject to foreign disclosure restrictions when the solicitation is issued.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS. 
The following Request for Information (RFI) is issued for purposes
of conducting market research and encouraging commercial companies to provide information concerning current industry practices. Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) Infantry Weapons Product Group is formulating acquisition and life cycle support strategies for flash hiders for weapons of .50 caliber and less. These devices should be compatible with current weapon systems, in particular the M16A2, M249, M240G, and M2.  The flash hider should significantly reduce current flash signature, making the discharge of the weapon as close to invisible as possible to both the naked eye and third generation night vision devices.  Installation of the flash hider should be able to be accomplished by the operator or 2nd echelon maintenance facility.  MARCORSYSCOM is seeking candidate systems which do not require additional special tools.  The device should not significantly affect the shot dispersion, trajectory of the round, zero of the weapon, or cycle of the weapon.  These systems will be operational and maintainable in all types of climates and terrain where Marines deploy, specifically in arid, tropical, temperate, and arctic climates, as well as amphibious operations. Background information: The Marine Corps is looking for available COTS systems to fulfill these requirements, potentially acquiring several thousand systems of each caliber.  Industry firms capable of rapidly accomplishing the required services, in whole or in part, are invited to submit a response to this notice.  Firms should identify/submit a copy of their GSA schedule.  Firms should also include literature, brochures, price lists, and capabilities summaries directly addressing their ability to meet the aforementioned needs.   Interested firms are requested to respond NLT 25 January 2002, stating their business size, NAICS Code, and identifying a corporate point of contact. Interested sources should respond to: (U. S. Mail address) Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command, ATTN CT-JC, 2033 Barnett Ave., Suite 315, Quantico, VA 22134-5010. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)

FOR DOCUMENT CONVERSION SERVICES FOR THE DOCUMENT AUTOMATION AND PRODUCTION SERVICE (DAPS)

OFADD:  Fleet Industrial Supply Center Norfolk, Detachment Washington, 1014 N Street, SE, Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C. 20374

SUBJECT:  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - DOCUMENT CONVERSION SERVICES

RFI #:  N00600-02-I-1961

DUE:	July 15, 2002

POC:  Roxanne Dunn, Contract Specialist

DESC:   This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the Department of the Navy's Fleet Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk, Detachment Washington, to solicit information from potential industry sources on state of the art approaches to document conversion that will allow the Document Automation and Production Service (DAPS) to continue to provide document conversion services to convert paper and digital documents into formats conducive for electronic storage, document/content management systems, and digital document work flow processes currently used and being actively pursued within the Department of Defense and other serviced Federal Executive Branch Agencies.

Digital documents and digital content are becoming more prevalent in logistics, defense and governmental workflow processes and procedures. As with all computationally based technologies, imaging and content management tools and processes are rapidly changing. The pace of this change coupled with the lengthy process for establishing acquisition and contracts for these services is a difficult problem. Requirement specifications that are more than a year old may miss important capabilities and lead to a shortened useful lifetime for conversion services. The DAPS recognizes that a need exists to keep pace with new technologies and conversion innovations that will enhance the fulfillment of the DAPS mission in support of the DoD and Federal agencies. 

FISC Detachment Washington is formulating requirements for the development of a Statement of Work to award multiple Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for acquiring a wide range of conversion services for DAPS on behalf of the Department of Defense, the military services and other Federal Executive Branch customers that DAPs supports with state of the art technologies/ouput formats, improved response/turnaround times and fair and reasonable prices.

The focus is to proactively address document/digital conversion issues deemed vital to the Department of Defense, on a global basis with anticipation of its future needs and requirements. 

*This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Additionally, the Government may utilize any information submitted by interested parties to assist in developing a statement of work and/or statement of objectives that could potentially result in a competitive solicitation.  We advise offerors not to submit any information that they would not want to be used for this purpose.*  

Background 

The Document Automation & Production Service (DAPS) is the Defense Department's preferred provider of document services, including document conversion, digital warehousing, CD ROM production, printing, duplicating, distribution, and copier management.  During the 1990's, DAPS was responsible for converting over 200 million pages of legacy paper and engineering drawing documents; microfilm aperture cards, microfiche, and other types of microform; and, existing digital data to a wide variety of government and industry standard file formats. Virtually every type of document and data utilized within the Department of Defense continues to be automated by DAPS, including but not limited to: technical manuals; training manuals; financial, contracting and purchasing data; administrative records; weapons system repair and maintenance records; personnel/payroll records and data; data processing reports; regulations;and directives. 

The current DAPS multiple award procurement vehicle seeks to offer professional, highly skilled, responsible service providers who possess a wide variety of expertise in the area of document conversion for both unclassified and classified requirements; where all services are performed "onshore" by production facilities holding active security clearances. Through the use this type of procurement vehicle, DAPS will be able to offer a flexible and convenient means of meeting document conversion needs through timely, efficient, cost effective, "best value," services administered at major DAPS locations.

RFI Information

The Government prefers that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this RFI.However, the government would like any information relating to contracts that potential services providers have in place such as:  Contract number, who the contract is with, and any other information relevant to the contract such as price list, pricing etc.  All information in response to this RFI, questions/concerns, data packages, suggestions, etc. and requests to be informed of the status of any possible solicitation resulting from this RFI shall be sent, via e-mail to the Attn:  Roxanne Dunn, contract specialist @ roxanne_l_dunn@fmso.navy.mil, or by fax: 202-433-9586 (phone: 202-433-8597).  We would prefer any attachments you use to be in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and/or Microsoft Power Point.   Also, hard copies of your responses to this RFI can be submitted to: Fleet Industrial Supply Center Norfolk, Detachment Washington, Attn: Roxanne Dunn, 1014 N Street, SE, Suite 400, Washington Navy Yard, D.C. 20374-5014.  Responses should be received here no later than July 15, 2002.  Responses should include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with government representatives.  All correspondence concerning this RFI should reference and refer to RFI No. N00600-02-I-1961.

Lastly, we strongly encourage potential service providers to use the information provided herein as reference information.  We are looking for innovative ways to enhance conversion service offerings through state of the art services, capabilities and breakthrough strategies.  Potential service providers will be asked to propose conversion services on a fixed price per page/image basis for commonly encountered situations. Although DAPS understands that conversion service requirements vary considerably in difficulty according to a wide variety of factors, and that there is often a need for document or project assessment and workflow engineering, it is also equally important that customers be able to ascertain relatively quickly what a estimated cost might be based upon a given number of pages/images offered up for conversion.


A service provider may have an idea that does not fit into the framework of our current way of providing conversion services, but it may open our eyes to a totally new and more effective way to offer these services.  Potential service providers are encouraged not to feel confined by the current way the DAPS is offering these services, but to suggest any and all ideas they have that can add value to our customers.  Additionally, DAPS would be interested in ascertaining whether commercial providers see a benefit in the ability to respond to selected, individual tasks as opposed to being required to address all tasks/conversion requirements. We are looking very forward to your ideas and feedback.

<SUBJECT>66 -- COMPONENTS FOR MEASURAND MOTION CAPTURE SYSTEM
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE --  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in Morgantown, WV is interested in acquiring components of a patented Measurand, Inc. ShapeWrap motion capture system with the capability to monitor lower limbs.  These components will be combined with a Measurand Inc. system currently being used by NIOSH which monitors the upper body and upper limbs of the wearer.  A portion of this procurement is also to provide a second complete set of motion-monitoring components (upper limb, trunk, and lower limb) which will enable us to pursue research at an enhanced pace and examine different research applications simultaneously.  To meet our needs the system must have  the following characteristics:   motion-monitoring capability that can be worn by humans that imposes minimal constraint upon the wearer's mobility; does not require tether cables; does not impose a requirement to remain within a constrained, calibrated work area; and remains largely impervious to environmental variations in noise, light, and proximity to ferromagnetic masses.  The Government intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Measurand, Inc., Fredericton, NB Canada because they are presently the sole source of motion-measurement technologies that are compatible with the monitoring of the motion of human limbs during the execution of physical work in large, unstructured work-volume applications (e.g., multi-story warehouses), while remaining impervious to environmental variations in noise, light, and proximity to ferromagnetic masses.  Their unique, patented technology has been identified by -- and is being used by -- NASA principals to establish a collaborative research program to pursue common goals relating to the monitoring and assessment of human motion during the performance of work activities.  By using this technology, NIOSH will be able to more effectively relate our research efforts and progress to NASA's and thus be better-able to act synergistically to realize shared goals.   Organizations with similar capabilities  may respond within 7 days after publication of this notice.  Responses shall be submitted to:  Brenda L. Goodwin (MS-1019), Reference: #2002-Q-00477,  DHHS, PHS, CDC,  NIOSH, ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505.  Simplified acquisition procedures will be utilized for this acquisition.  Information received would generally be used for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This notice is issued for informational purposes only.
