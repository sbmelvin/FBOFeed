<DESC>The National Immunization Program (NIP), in Atlanta, GA, and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), in Hyattsville, MD, both centers of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA) intend to award a cost reimbursement type contract to a qualified offeror for the project entitled the National Immunization Survey (NIS), which includes the State and Local Area Integrated Telephone Survey (SLAITS), for the data years 2005 through 2007 (with options to continue data collection for 2008 through 2009).  A data year is one calendar year, January 1 – December 31, plus six months of the next calendar year, January 1 through June 30 (e.g., data year 2005 is January 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006 for immunization data collection, file, and documentation production purposes).  This project involves 1) the design and conduct of quarterly/annual surveys to be fielded in each of the Immunization Action Plan (IAP) areas collecting data from the families of age-eligible children in RDD interviews for data years 2005-2007 (with options to continue data collection for data years 2008-2009); 2) collecting data from the medical providers reported for those children (with oral consent from the parent or guardian); 3) combining the information from the responding providers and families to produce improved vaccination estimates; 4) performing descriptive analyses of the data collected; 5) preparing and documenting computer files of the survey data; 6) conducting qualitative research; and 7) maintaining a sophisticated and flexible computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) system to track and monitor calls to over one million households annually.  The surveys in each of the IAP areas comprise a large-scale survey of households requiring random digit dialing (RDD) and use of the CATI system.  Some households will require interviewers to conduct the interview in a language other than English or Spanish.  Large amounts of data will need to be processed and analyzed, and reports need to be written, often under tight time schedules during the performance period of the contract.  The date specified for receipt of offers will be 60 days after the solicitation issue date, on or about January 21, 2004.  The performance period under this contract will be three years from date of contract award with the option for an additional 24 months.  All responsible offers may submit a proposal that will be considered by the agency.  The NAICS Code is 541990.  See Numbered Note 26.  Paper copies of the solicitation will not be made available; however, the solicitation will be available for retrieval at www.fedbizopps.gov.  Telephonic requests will not be accepted.  It will be the responsibility of offerors to monitor the above website for additional postings regarding this solicitation.

<DESC>This is a notice of contract action (NOCA) to advise all potential offerors that a Request for Quote (RFQ)is anticipated to be issued on 20 Nov 2003 as a Full and Open Competition requirement for:  The Engineering and Technical Support Branch of the Air Force Safety Center currently supports two Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) demonstration projects.  These projects collect flight data recorder downloads and processes them through specialized computer software to uncover mishap precursors-- trends and deviations from standard procedures and parameters.  The analysis products are then available as guidance to operations, training, maintenance, safety, R&D, and design decisions 
Recent funding actions direct an expansion of the current demonstration programs and deployment of MFOQA into other airframes. Each additional airframe project requires tailoring to individual aircraft configuration and missions.  A multi-phase approach to the growth of MFOQA within the Air Force includes:
a.	Concept Validation-Determine MFOQA resource and process requirements.
b.	Development and Demonstration-Placement of resources and development of analyses.
c.	Targeted Analyses Development-Refinement of analyses, MAJCOM transition, and automatic report generation.
d.	Operational Integration.

The objectives of this task are to demonstrate long-range safety benefits of MFOQA programs by developing and integrating mishap precursor detection and mitigation tools into USAF aerial operations, and to reveal to the Major Commands the long-term value of MFOQA programs through additional applications in operations, training, logistics, acquisition, and maintenance.

Scope of Work.  This task involves validating the MFOQA concept throughout the Air Force, for a variety of aircraft configurations and missions.  Software enabling the MFOQA concept shall be developed, which will permit the analyst to identify standard procedures, deviations from standard procedures and parameter exceedances (often called the event set), perform statistical analyses, and to animate the flight data.  Flight data analysis products shall be presented to AFSC and the Major Commands, and used to keep the Air Force abreast of current safety, operational, training and maintenance trends in its flying community.  Regular communication between the contractor and Air Force personnel shall ensure current areas of interest, especially safety, operations, training and maintenance, are examined.  Monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual reports shall ensure the data is distributed to the greatest population possible.  An overall program manager will facilitate communication between the Air Force and the contractor(s), and will coordinate all software and hardware needs.  The technical supervisor will have the skills necessary to manage several large and perhaps varied databases and troubleshoot a variety of data analysis programs.  Software vendors may vary from program phase to program phase, and between aircraft.

<ARCHDATE>11042004
<CONTACT>Theora McVay Contract Specialist 4022213487     theora_mcvay@nps.gov;
<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS), Midwest Regional Office, Omaha, Nebraska is seeking qualified organizations to provide Architect/Engineer (A/E) services under indefinite quantity contracts for historic preservation projects for historic structures and historic and cultural landscapes in park areas in the Midwest Region (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, North and South Dakota). The properties and related projects vary in complexity, scale and the problems to be addressed.  The properties are located within the National Park Service, Midwest Region units and National Historic Landmarks (NHLs) under a variety of ownerships. The Midwest Region contains over fifty individual parks, with over two thousand historic structures, over one thousand cultural landscapes and over four hundred NHLs.  The Midwest Region of the NPS includes nationally significant historic sites associated with Indian cultures, the fur trade, the exploration and opening of the American West, Civil War and frontier battles, presidential homes, and important 20th century developments in business, society and civil rights.  Additionally there are parks of scenic and natural beauty which include historic structures in cultural landscapes of local significance. The NHLs present in the Midwest Region represent a large cross-section of American history and design.  They are among the nation's most significant historic places, and while some are units within the National Park system, most are owned by other governmental agencies, non-profits, or private individuals.  The diverse NHLs include residences, farms, military, industrial and commercial complexes, designed and vernacular landscapes, monuments and cemeteries.  The sites represent the development of the Midwest and include not only vernacular designs but high style examples of French Colonial, Gothic, Queen Anne, Tudor, Classical Revival, Craftsman and Moderne. Most of the NPS properties are vernacular in nature.  These include: historic institutional or military complexes, such as life-saving stations, lighthouses, schools, and forts; industrial complexes, such as mines and mining town sites, steel producing and shipping districts; agricultural properties, such as those supporting farming, ranching, fishing and logging; historic transportation systems such as canals, railroads, roads, maritime and aviation properties; a large variety of homes and cabins ranging from Mandan-Hidasta earth lodges, to resorts, to presidential homes, to model and modular houses. Designed or relatively high-style properties include:  parks  developed by the Civilian Conservation Corps, parkways and recreational lodges, cabins and shelter structures; Beaux Arts- inspired landscapes, monuments, and memorials; institutional campuses, cemeteries and military parks; and unique artistic creations such as the Gateway Arch and Mount Rushmore. The scope of work encompasses Title I Services including physical investigation and materials testing, preparation of condition reports, cultural landscape and historic structure reports, treatment recommendations, and preliminary designs and estimates, value analysis, asbestos and lead paint analysis, and other architectural/engineering work; Title II Services including preparation of construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates and value engineering; and Title III Services including construction management such as inspection/ observation, site visits, consultation, review of submittals and shop drawings, and preparation of operation and maintenance manuals and as-built drawings. Disciplines including:  historical architecture; historical landscape architecture; architectural history; soil, structural, plumbing, mechanical, and electrical engineering; interpretation planning and media design; and certified value analysis.  Secondary support disciplines include materials and art conservation, surveying, historical research, horticulture of local and vintage plants, ecological restoration specialist, civil, environmental, and geotechnical engineering.   A/E Services performed in historic buildings, landscapes or sites will require continuous attention to and compliance with historic preservation guidelines.  All work will be guided by NPS policies and directives, however historic resources often present unique and unusual conditions and the NPS encourages creativity in the development of preservation methods. The NPS has adopted sustainable design as one of the guiding principle for park planning and development.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  In practice, sustainable design minimizes the short- and long-term environmental impacts of development activity through resource conservation, recycling, waste minimization, and the utilization of energy efficient and ecologically responsible materials and techniques for construction. Projects will require coordination with various review and planning entities.  Prospective firms shall demonstrate past experience with historic structures and landscapes, archaic building and landscape materials and compatible contemporary design.  The following criteria in descending order of importance shall be used in the evaluation of the prospective firms:  1.  Professional qualifications of the firm and staff proposed for satisfactory performance of desired services; 2.  The firm has substantial specialized experience and technical competence as prime contractor or as a consultant on historic preservation projects for the National Park Service or other public/government or non-profit agencies; 3.  Capacity to accomplish multiple projects within the desired time schedule and to manage multi-faceted projects within schedule; 4.  Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; 5.  Proximity to and knowledge of the thirteen state Midwest region listed above. 6.  A/E firm shall demonstrate expertise in conducting value analysis (VA) at planning and pre-design stages, as well as the more traditional value engineering (VE) studies. The firm shall also demonstrate expertise in utilization of value methods in decision making e.g. Choosing by Advantages (CBA), functional analysis e.g. FAST diagram, life cycle cost analysis, importance(benefit) to cost graphing or other method of evaluating non-monetary benefits; enabling and assisting the NPS to make benefit cost decisions and comparisons.  A/E shall identify facilitator(s) with Certified Value Specialist certification or approved equal, to conduct studies and consult with the prime with regard to decision making methods. The services will be provided under an indefinite quantity contract.  The total of all work orders per year will not exceed $1,000,000 and no single work order will exceed $500,000.  The A/E is guaranteed a minimum amount of $15,000 per contract year.  The term of this contract shall be one year with four one-year renewal options.  The government reserves the right to select more than one firm from this solicitation. This procurement is open to small and large businesses and is subject to Public Law 100-656.  To the fullest extent, the NPS welcomes the participation of small business firms including woman- and minority-owned and operated A/E firms and encourages large business firms to include small business firms as part of their team.  A sub contracting plan will be required of large business prior to award.  The government will not indemnify the firm selected against liability involving asbestos or other hazardous materials; that is, no clause holding the firm harmless will be included in the Contract. A/E firms which meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit a Letter of Interest and one set of completed Standard Forms 254 for each firm and a team Standard Form 255.  Responses must be received at National Park Service, Midwest Regional Office, 1709 Jackson Street, Omaha, NE 68102, Attention:  Theora McVay, before 2:00 p.m., December 8, 2003,  in order to be considered for this selection.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center-Panama City, FL, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7001 intends to issue a sole-source purchase order to Vehicle Control Technologies (VCT), 11180 Sunrise Valley Drive, Reston, VA 20191 to analyze the AN/AQS-20A hydrodynamic data from ship-tow and MH-53E tow test and use it as an input data to correlate existing models and improve model validity.  Only VCT can provide the required support because they have performed all of the mathematic modeling for the AN/AQS-20/A tow body.  VCT is the company that created and owns the AN/AQS-20A model.  To accurately correlate and validate the AN/AQS-20A model is critical to the operation of the AN/AQS-20A.  Use of another company to conduct the correlation and validation may introduce new or change existing parameters that may induce unacceptable error into the AN/AQS-20A system.  Failure to have an a ccurate model could result in significant damage to the AN/AQS-20A tow body and maybe even loss of U. S. Navy vessels.  Delivery will be to the Naval Surface Warfare Center-Panama City, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL, 32407-7001.NAICS code is 541330. SBA Size Standard is $4.0 million. FSC is AD24.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Laboratory of Functional and Molecular Imaging (LFMI), plans to procure on a sole source basis with Nova Medical Inc, 4 Railroad Avenue 303, Wakefield MA 01880 a 16 channel decoupling preamplifier detector. The services and supplies herein are being procured using the simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industrial Classification System code is 339112 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The Laboratory of Functional and Molecular Imaging performs research in neuroimaging, primarily based on Magnetic Resonance (MR) related techniques. In addition to developing novel neuroimaging applications, LFMI is heavily involved in the development of basic technology. In order to improve MRI image resolution, state of the art MRI systems with strong magnetic fields are needed, in order to fully utilize the capabilities of the 3T system.  For this purpose LFMI recently purchased a 3.0T whole-body MRI scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI.), the first commercial system available.  NINDS requires a 16-channel phased array receive coil for which the 16 channels are independent and mutually decoupled.  The array must be compatible with the GE scanner.  Nova Medical has developed unique, proprietary technology for MRI RE receive coil arrays with low array element coupling specifically for accelerated MR imaging using methods such as sensitivity encoding (SENSE) or simultaneous measurement of spatial harmonics (SMASH), that are essential for rapid and high resolution imaging.  The GE compatible Nova Medical surface coil array will enable us to perform high quality accelerated SENSE imaging.  Nova Medical has developed and tested several generations of cardiac and brain surface coils based on this technology.  Nova Medical is the only source known to the NINDS that can provide the 16-channel MRI preamplifier detector that has the compatibility to work with existing equipment.   This product and its integration with the MRI scanner are unique to Nova Medical and is not available from other manufacturers. The detector and pre-amplifier set work in concert with other products NINDS has purchased from Nova Medical for the 3T MRI scanner in early 2003.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, especially with regard to compatibility, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NINDS to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM, EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on November 21, 2003.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement and accompanying statement of work constitutes the only solicitation and replaces RFQ-DC-04-00015 announced October 22, 2003 in its entirety.  Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation document will not be issued.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 01-16.  This acquisition is  unrestricted.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541620.  The total budget for this project is not expected to exceed $200,000 for eight research papers (or $25,000 per paper) and is subject to the availability of funds.  All interested parties may submit a proposal.  The US EPA has a  requirement for original research papers of 5,000 to 10,000 words on the topic of the relationship between socioeconomic forces and emissions of greenhouse gases and other radiatively important emissions, such as sulfur dioxide. Proposals must encompass original research or applications of theory.   Papers that propose new theoretical frameworks that seek to refine or elaborate on the "Environmental Kuznets Curve" theory and papers that seek empirical existence of such theories are preferable.  Specific topics may include: The role and interplay of various socioeconomic forces such GDP growth,  price of energy, structure of the economy, governance structure, fuel resource availability, technological change and diffusion; The immediacy of the gas or pollutant's effect on health and environment; price shocks or other social or economic watersheds; energy use; agriculture and land use;  transportation; and the role of environmental policies such "integrated environmental strategies" in shaping alternative development pathways. The EPA has made preliminary arrangements with the Journal of Environment and Development for the publication of the articles as a special issue to be  published in the first quarter of 2005. The offeror shall select one or more topics from the above list and submit for each: 1) A research plan, including a working theory or hypothesis, or a study question relevant to the program, 2) A proposed outline of the paper, 3) Curriculum Vitae of the  author, co-author or research assistants, including publication lists; and a firm-fixed price quote for the effort including a break-down of the costs comprising the total price.    Awards will be made to the offeror(s) whose quote affords the best value to the Government, technical, price, and  other factors considered.  The following evaluation criteria will apply: 1) Relevance of the proposal to the project plan; 2) Strength of the research plan; 3) Experience (past performance) of the offeror in development economics, climate change policy and economics, environmental economics  generally, and "Environmental Kuznets Curve" work.  All technical factors are considered to be of equal importance and when combined are considered more important than price.  The offeror(s) selected to receive the award of a purchase order resulting from this solicitation must register with the  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to receiving the award.  The CCR may be accessed at http://www.ccr.gov. The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: 52.212-1, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, 52.222-2, 52.222-21, 52.222-22, 52.222-25, 52.225-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36,  52.222-37, 52.225-13, and 52.232-18.  The following EPAAR clauses apply to this acquisition: 1552.208-70 and 1552.209-71.  All quotes should be submitted via e-mail to Rachel Schwartz at schwartz.rachel@epa.gov or by facsimile to 202-565-2554 by close of business January 15, 2004.  Awards are  anticipated to be made in mid-February 2004.  Questions regarding this acquisition should be submitted in writing to Rachel Schwartz at schwartz.rachel@epa.gov by e-mail.  Telephonic requests for information will not be honored.  This requirement will also be announced in the December issue of the  Journal of Environment and Development.   Statement of Work Background and Purpose Long term analyses of climate change and long term projections of emissions such as those undertaken by the IPCC in its Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) are often based on an underlying assumption of  emissions varying with factors such as income, technological change and population.  In some cases, and for some pollutants, the relationship between income and emissions is explicit.  For example, in many of the SRES scenarios is the assumption that as nations develop, their preference for air  quality improvements grows, and hence the presence of SO2 controls increases.  In other cases, and for other pollutants, the relationship may be more ambiguous and implicit only.  For example, technological progress that accompanies economic development may lead to increases in energy efficiency;  if these phenomena are coincident with increasing GDP per capita, then a gradual environmental improvement on a per capita basis may be derived from the data. One relationship between emissions and income that is often discussed in the development economics literature is the inverse U-shaped  "Environmental Kuznets Curve" (EKC).  The EKC is a graphical representation of a phenomenon behind which there is some empirical evidence ? and much theory ? that as nations develop their emissions increase up to a point beyond which emissions decline while income, or GDP, continues to grow.  There  are generally two theoretical foundations cited for the EKC phenomenon.  The first  theory is that as nations' economies transition through the developmental stages  of agrarian to industrial to service economies, their emissions naturally peak and decline.  The second theory generally hypothesized  is that as personal wealth increases, preferences for goods such as environmental quality become more evident and are eventually realized through changes in consumptive behavior and in regulatory actions.  In recent years, a number of studies have begun to question the EKC, noting, among other  things, that the empirical evidence may not exist in many cases; that the assumptions regarding the chronology and the functional form of the income-emissions relationship can have substantial effect on the shape and slope of the EKC; that different EKCs are likely to exist for different countries  and pollutants; that the direction of causality is itself not clear, and that explanatory variables other than income may be better determinants of emissions trajectories.   While EPA does not have an Agency position on the EKC theory per se, part of the purpose of this series would be to refine  the environment-development debate, specifically as it applies to long-term projections of greenhouse gases and other radiatively important emissions.  Some critiques of the EKC have found that the quadratic form is too restrictive: is there a more robust form to apply or is there no single  appropriate function.  Other critiques have found that variation across countries is critical for understanding patterns of pollution. If so, what are the key socioeconomic factors driving that variation? In short, EPA's interest does not lie a critique or defense of the EKC theory or of any EKC  construction in particular; but in obtaining a sound theoretical basis for long-term projections of radiatively important gases and aerosols. Task The contractor shall prepare a 5,000 to 10,000 paper on the general theme of socioeconomic drivers of radiatively important emissions that encompasses  original research or applications of theory.  The paper shall be prepared in accordance with the guidelines specified by the Journal Of Environment and Development.  For details please refer to: http://www2-irps.ucsd.edu/~jed/INSTRUCTIONS%20TO%20AUTHORS.htm  The contractor shall submit the  research paper to EPA for review and to the JED for formal peer review simultaneously by August 31, 2004.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009, email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mr. Ismeth Abdullah; Chairman; Batam Industrial Development Authority; BIDA Building, Batam Centre; Batam 29400, Indonesia; Phone: (62-778) 462047 – 48; Fax: (62-778) 462458, 462240, 462432.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance to support a comprehensive security assessment at the Hang Nadim International Airport in Batam, Indonesia.

The Batam Industrial Development Authority, which operates the airport, is the Grantee for this project.  The Government of Indonesia (GOI) designated Batam as a center for industrial growth and passed legislation to encourage the island as a destination for foreign investment.  Batam has a favorable investment climate that allows it to reap the benefits of increased economic integration with neighboring Singapore; GOI expects this provision to dramatically increase the flow of cargo and passenger traffic through the airport, which will further necessitate the adoption of security measures at the airport’s facilities.

The Hang Nadim International Airport was constructed in 1995 and has yet to conduct a comprehensive security assessment.  The airport currently lacks many elements of an efficient security system, including a perimeter fence.  Additionally, the cargo warehouse lacks an operational x-ray scanner, and none of the airport’s passenger scanners include explosive detection.  Although the airport was designed to handle 3.5 million passengers per year, and despite current plans to expand the airport to accommodate greater passenger and cargo traffic, there are no formal security programs in place.  This technical assistance is being provided to help realize the airport’s security objectives and develop an investment plan to procure equipment and establish an adequate security infrastructure.

The technical assistance contractor will be required to: (1) review the operations of airport terminals and airfields; (2) develop specific requirements for security systems; (3) develop capital costs and investment requirements; (4) develop financing options; (5) assess training requirements; (6) preparation and submission of a Final Report and development of tender documents.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $290,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, December 19, 2003, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Nurad Technologies, Inc. in Baltimore, MD for the purchase of Three (3) Nurad Technologies, Inc. Reflector Assemblies, Part Number 948-00360-001 Rev X.******The required Reflector Assemblies are for NIST’s Neutron Backscattering Spectrometer. The Neutron Backscattering Spectrometer currently utilizes a Nurad Technologies, Inc. Reflector Assembly. It has acquired six of these in the past from Nurad. The Nurad Technologies, Inc. Reflector Assembly is a vital component of the Doppler Drive for the Neutron Backscattering Spectrometer, without this special Doppler Drive Reflector Assembly, the Spectrometer would not be operational. This unique device, the only one in the USA and one of only two such devices in the world, is subject, during operation, to incredible stresses. The Doppler Drive Reflector, which has a surface area of approximately two square feet and only weighs two pounds, is subject to 109g (g-force) and cannot deflect more than ten thousands of an inch. The Nurad Technologies, Inc. Reflector is made of composite material to keep its weight down to a minimum compatible with its strength and rigidity. The Reflector Assembly is constructed from graphite and other composite materials. The sole source requirement is based on the need for additional Reflector Assemblies to be 100% compatible and interchangeable with the existing Nurad Technologies, Inc. Reflector Assemblies and the existing computer designed reciprocating cam system designed for the Nurad Technologies, Inc. Reflector Assembly. Nurad Technologies, Inc. does not only hold the propriety rights on the composition of the Reflector Assembly, it also possesses the finite-element analysis results for its design, has the molds necessary to build it and the equipment to accurately balance it.******Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 12 months after receipt of order.******The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333314, and the size standard is 500 employees.******No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by November 17, 2003.******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT	--OFFICE MODERNIZATION
The University of California, Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), which is operated under Prime Contract DE-AC03-76SF00098 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), intends to subcontract for professional Architect-Engineering (AE) services for a proposed office modernization project.  Construction cost for the project is currently estimated in the $300,000 to $500,000 range.

The proposed office modernization project may target several key LBNL buildings on its main site or in local off-site leased space.  The proposed project will yield an office configuration that increases occupancy density; improves quality; and provides greater occupant interaction, collaboration, and satisfaction.  The proposed project will concentrate first on large blocks of space (approximately 7,000 gsf per block) containing mainly administrative functions.

The project includes conceptual design of alternative layouts; reduction in the number of enclosed offices and individual cubicles; consolidation of file rooms, copy rooms, and other shared space; and provision for common gathering areas, e.g. coffee bars, conversation areas, etc.

b.	Documentation Compatibility: The primary firm and sub consultants must be able to generate, receive, or convert documents into Microsoft WORD, Microsoft EXCEL, Microsoft Project, and AutoCAD (latest version).

<DESC>The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. The following document describes the procurement for Construction Manager As Constructor (CMc) services for the proposed adaptive reuse of Building 7 of the GSA Campus, Auburn, Washington, from existing warehouse space into office space.  DEFINITION OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGER AS CONSTRUCTOR: The General Services Administration (GSA) defines a CMc as a firm that contracts directly with a building owner, here, GSA, to provide pre-construction services as well as general construction and construction management services. The CMc will be a member of the project development team during the design and construction phases, working with GSA, GSA's selected A-E firm, and other GSA consultants.  The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and various options for Construction Phase Services, which are described below. The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step (FAR 15.202), and Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures. Stage 1 of the process will be a Request for Qualifications, under which the Government will evaluate experience and past performance and advise offerors of their competitive viability. The Government will evaluate Stage 1 submissions to establish a Voluntary Short List (those firms considered to have a reasonable chance of being selected for award). Firms on the Voluntary Short List will be invited by the Government to participate in Oral presentations, followed by stage 2 submissions. Stage 2 submissions will consist of a conceptual estimate and pricing for Pre-construction phase services, and any other requirements stated in detail in the RFP. For those within the competitive range, the Government may enter into discussions before soliciting Final Price Revisions. However the Government reserves the right to award the contract without discussions. Contract Award: A fixed price contract will be awarded to the selected firm to provide Preconstruction Phase services. The price for Construction Phase services will be negotiated at a later date and should result in a fixed price award fee contract.  Stage 2, Request for Proposals, which will solicit price proposals, and additional technical evaluation factors. For this contract, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price (see FAR 15.101-1 trade offs). PROJECT SUMMARY: The project scope includes conversion of approximately 120,000 gross square feet of warehouse space to office space. The project includes demolition, base building construction, tenant fit-out, and site work.  The building tenant will be the Social Security Administration (SSA) Teleservice Center. The estimated range for construction cost, including tenant fit out is $10,000,000 to $20,000,000. Occupancy is anticipated by January 2007. SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED: The CMc will provide professional, technical, administrative and clerical personnel, as needed, to perform all required services to renovate the building, including, but not limited to, those described in this presolicitation notice. The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities, which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs). The CMc must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly development and construction of the proposed project. The CMc will be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of architectural, civil, structural, mechanical and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines. Pre-construction Phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, review and evaluation of the concept, design development and construction document submissions for constructibility, value engineering suggestions, identification of any problems or errors in the design and design documentation, consultation during construction document production, preliminary project schedule development, primary cost estimates during design development and construction documents, and development of subcontractor and supplier interest. Construction Phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, renovation and conversion of the building in accordance with the specifications, administration of the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, maintaining of construction records including daily logs and monthly reports, monitoring of construction costs, "commissioning" and turnover to designated facility management staff, and other required supplemental services as requested by GSA. During contract performance, the CMc shall provide GSA with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, means to achieve the best value in performance, necessary actions, schedule control, alternative ideas, problem/claim prevention, and budgeting. The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, and the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration. Most importantly, the CMc shall have complete responsibility for renovation and conversion of the facility.  SB - SDB Participation: Although this procurement is open to large business, small and minority-owned firms are strongly encouraged to participate. The Government recognizes the talent existing in smaller firms and encourages their participation in the construction of Federal facilities. Short-listed firms shall provide a brief written narrative of their outreach efforts to utilize small disadvantaged and small women-owned businesses on this project. An acceptable Subcontracting Plan shall be agreed upon prior to contract award to any large business. Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve participation goals.   PROPOSAL SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Proposals will be evaluated using a two-stage, Advisory Multi-Step process (FAR 15.202). Under Stage I of the Request for Proposal (RFP), #GS-10P-03-LTC-0074, offerors must submit information regarding qualifications, past experience, past performance, personnel, and resources.

After evaluation, all offerors will be notified in writing of their potentials as viable competitors and whether they will be invited to participate in Stage II of the selection process. Notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to the submissions, offerors may participate in the Stage II process. The Government reserves the right to make an award based on Stage II proposals without holding discussions.

<CONTACT>Randy White 8128541474
<DESC>This amendment is issued to answer questions concerning this request for quotation. 1.  Note 22 is hereby deleted from the synopsis.  2.  The following questions have been asked and questions provided.  Question 1.  Induction heating power supply output power.  As the 105mm projectile is larger than in past operations, your experience will help confirm that the previously used 20kw induction unit has enough capacity to provide the needed heating for the 105mm.  Answer.  The 81mm mortar weighed 2.27 lbs.  This was heated to 300 deg F in 109 seconds using 45% power setting, which equaled 9kW.  The 105mm projectile will be weighed after the abrasive waterjet cutting operation to determine weight.  It is estimated that the steel casing will weigh approximately 20 lbs. (16 lbs. of steel, 4 pounds of TNT) after cutting.  Question 2.  Workload.  Can Crane quickly provide  a drawing of the 105mm projectile?  This will aid in costing and quoting the induction coil fro the project.  Answer.  Yes.  The drawing has already been provided to contractors that have expressed an interest in this project.  Question 3.  Remote operator control panel.  The last project used a remote operator panel for the induction equipment.  Assuming this is again needed, will Crane require the sixty feet of wiring from the induction power supply to the remote panel?  Answer.  Yes.  Question 4.  Power Transmission.  The last project utilized a bus bar to transfer induction power from the power source to the induction coil located within the bunker.  Is this busbar available for use on this project?  If not, we will quote a new bus bar for the 105mm project.  The busbar is available for use, but will only be useful to Pillar Corporation.  If a different comp any is awarded the purchase order, they must provide their own busbar.  Question 5.  As stated in the SOW 3.3.1.1 the drawing is to be included but was not.  Please provide the drawing.  Answer.  See answer to #2 above.  Question 6.  What is the desired temperature ramp rate?  Answer.  22 deg F per second  Question 7.  What are the “duplication of cost that would not likely be recovered by competition”?  Answer.  After a further review of this requirement, it is decided that the initial sole source determination is cancelled.  This acquisition is now available to all responsible, small businesses.  Question 8.  In response to this solicitation, does every company have to perform section 3.3 of the SOW?  Answer.  Yes  3.  All other terms and conditions remain the same.

<DESC>NOTE: PLEASE DISREGARD THE ORIGINAL STATEMENT CONCERNING ALTERNATE OFFERS NOT BEING EVALUATED.  THE FOLLOWING NOW APPLIES:
-DSCR will make every reasonable effort to determine prior to award, the acceptability of products offered which meet the savings evaluation threshold indicated below, and/or which have a reasonable chance to receive an award based upon the evaluation criteria. Generally the agency will not evaluate alternate offers not meeting the savings threshold.  The savings threshold is based on the cost of evaluation ($200.00 for local technical evaluation, plus $1,200.00 per Engineering Support Activity evaluation, plus the cost of any special testing required).  If the Agency determines that the evaluation cannot be completed due to urgent requirements for the item, the alternate offer will not be considered for present procurement, but will still be evaluated for technical acceptability for future procurements for the same item.-

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for market research purposes.  The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) is seeking Contractors with expertise in the fabrication and building of a custom Fourier transform infrared spectrometer for use in a high-vacuum, (10^-9 Torr) cryogenic (15K) environment in accordance with the information provided herein.***Detailed information on the Contractor’s experience and expertise in building the same or similar equipment must be sent to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Acquisition and Logistics Division, Attn: Carol A. Wood, Contract Specialist, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 3571, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-3571.  Submission must be received by 3:00 p.m. local time on 
December 2, 2003.  Original submissions are required.*** Contractors shall identify their business size, (small, small-disadvantaged, hub-zone, large etc.) in accordance with North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; the Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.  ALL BUSINESS SIZES ARE WELCOME TO RESPOND TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.*** THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS – IT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.*** DESIGN AND BUILD A BXR II CRYOGENIC-FT 
The BXR II is an infrared (2 – 30 micrometers wavelength) radiometer that is currently being designed at NIST.  The instrument is a high vacuum, cryogenic (15 K) device that incorporates a precise power measurement mode of operation and a high spectral resolution mode of operation.  At this time a large fraction of the BXR II design has been finalized.  In the current design, the BXR II samples a 7 cm diameter beam of infrared radiation and telescopes it down to approximately 1.5 cm. A field limiting aperture limits the divergence in the 1.5 cm beam to 5 mrad maximum, however it will typically be less than 1 mrad. In the precision power mode of operation the beam is directed towards a set of filters used for filter based radiometry. In the high spectral resolution mode of operation the beam is first directed through a proposed Cryogenic Fourier Transform (Cryo-FT) interferometer before passing through the filter based radiometer portion. At this time the Cryo-FT has only been designed in very rough terms and has been assigned a volume in the BXR II for its future existence.  A rough drawing of the current design configuration of the BXR II is available as an MS Word document, with the file name BXR II Design Mod7.doc. (E-MAIL REQUESTS FOR THIS DOCUMENT MUST BE SENT TO CAROL.WOOD@NIST.GOV).****DESIRED OUTCOME OF CONTRACT FOR CRYOGENIC-FT DESIGN AND BUILD:  The ultimate outcome any subsequent request for proposal would be to build a Cryo-FT that is fully compatible with the BXR II and meets the following optical requirements: spectral range of 7 – 14 micrometers minimum with a single beam splitter, spectral range 4 – 15 micrometers with a single beam splitter preferred, spectral range of 2 – 30 micrometers with interchangeable beam splitters, resolution of 1 wavenumber with lower resolution acceptable, beam diameter of 1.7 cm with no central obstruction, can accept and function to all specifications with a 5 mrad full cone divergent beam, uses a reference laser with wavelength shorter than 1 micrometer, reference laser and dyanamic alignment lasers (if needed) must not obstruct 1.7 cm central beam path, scan rate must be greater than 5 scans/minute, modulation efficiency of 20 % approximately, and beam redirection must be less than 0.3 arcmin during mirror scan.***Compatibility with the BXR II must be achieved in at least these following areas:  VACUUM/CRYOGENIC - All components must be made of material suitable for high vacuum, and all components must be fully operational at 15 K. All structural components and metallic optical components must be Aluminum Alloy 6061-T651 and heat treated for stress relief per military specification MIL-H-6088G.   MECHANICAL/OPTICAL – The Cryo-FT must fit within its allocated volume within the BXR II, as shown in the attached drawing. The Cryo-FT must also have a mounting system that is compatible with the BXR II which must be designed and confirmed with NIST personnel involved in the project. The input and output beams for the Cryo-FT must be at the precise locations and directions shown in the drawing and the total path length through the Cryo-FT, from the first BXR II moveable mirror surface to the second BXR II movable mirror surface, must be 17.000” ± 0.005”. A suitable example of a FT path length is shown in the drawing.  THERMAL MANAGEMENT - All Cryo-FT components within the BXR II will be maintained in a 15 K environment. Heat output of these components should be kept to a reasonable minimum. Moving parts and such as the scanning and alignment mirrors should be the primary contributors to heat generation and it is anticipated that such devices would dissipate less than 0.5 W total during continuous operation. Heat strapping shall be applied where possible and no elements should exceed 30 K during continuous operation. Thermal management issues shall be reviewed by NIST personnel during the design stage before the final system is implemented.***The delivered system shall be a complete and functional system. This shall consist of at least a vacuum-cryogenic Michelson interferometer that is to be placed into the BXR II, control hardware for the interferometer and software for remote control, data acquisition, spectra display and diagnostic work. Note that delivery of a successful instrument will be weighed heavily over delivery time.

Potential areas of growth are envisioned to be in the areas of: Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Re connaissance (C4ISR); Space; Missile Defense; Information Operations (IO); Global Strike; Infrastructure, Organization Analysis, and Evaluations; Intelligence Requirements; Systems Engineering and Systems Integration Analysis; Simulation and Modeling Devel opment; Rapid Prototyping and Limited Development; Software Development, Network Development, and Information Systems Support; Integrated Logistics Support; Emerging Technologies Analysis; Quick Response Support; Meetings and Conference Organization Suppor t; Staff Support; and Blue Force Tracking. The resultant contracts will include a base period of one year with four one-year options, with a total contract maximum of $300 million.  The Government intends to utilize the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code and size standard of  541710 and 1,000 employees for establishing the Small Business Size Standard.  Further, the Government intends to utilize a Cost-Plus Fixed Fee contract type for the resultant contract awards. The acquisition will be tailored to minimize the time it takes to satisfy the identified Government requirement commensurate with risk, common sense, and sound business practices.  The acquisition strategy will include:  concurrent performance of milestone  requirements (i.e. drafting of SOW, Source Selection Plan, publishing the synopsis, and drafting the Acquisition Plan); inclusion of industry to develop a positive business alliance through the issuance of a draft statement of work (SOW) and draft Request  for Proposals (RFP); the scheduling of two sets of One-On-One sessions with industry for the gathering of market research and industry feedback throughout the acquisition process; the inclusion of performance standards in the Performance-Based SOW; and, t he utilization of contractor formats with regard to quality assurance plans, test and configuration control plans and procedures, and deliverable formats and content. The Government anticipates the award of two contracts to satisfy this requirement based upon past experience with the SIS and SMDIS programs.  It is anticipated that  one award will be a set-aside for Small Business concerns and the other will be conducted under full and open competition.  For the full and open competition, the Government anticipates that minimum acceptable subcontracting goals and dollars on this requ irement expressed as a percentage of total planned subcontracts will be established and evaluation will include the extent and type of subcontracting proposed. In order to ensure the utilization of best commercial practices, maximization of competition, and achievement of cost efficiencies throughout the acquisition process, the Government intends to conduct the following market research activities: 1.  Release of draft SOW: the Government will release a draft SOW for industry comment on or about 7 November 2003.  The draft SOW will be posted on the SMDC/ARSTRAT internet website at http://www.armyspace.army.mil.  All industry comments pertaining to th e draft SOW shall be submitted via email to janet.schwarzbart@arspace.army.mil and gordon.baxendale@arspace.army.mil.  The due date for Government receipt of industry comments pertaining to the draft SOW shall be provided via the SMDC/ARSTRAT internet webs ite. 2.  Conduct Market Research One-on-One Sessions with Industry: the Government intends to conduct an initial round of one-on-one sessions with industry on 19 and 20 November 2003.  The initial one-on-one sessions will not be a forum for the Government to pr ovide acquisition or program information to industry, but rather a means for the Government to conduct market research by obtaining industry comments and recommendations on various issues pertaining to the acquisition.  The discussions held at the one-on-o nes will not be recorded nor published subsequently.  All pertinent recommendations and comments will be incorporated, as appropriate, into the Governments acquisition strategy and draft Request for Proposal (RFP).  The one-on-one sessions will be limited to four one-hour meetings per day and will be scheduled on a first-come, first-served basis.  The SMDC/ARSTRAT internet website (http://www.armyspace.army.mil) will also contain information on the one-on-one sessions, and will be the means by which interes ted contractors reserve their appointment for a one-on-one meeting. The following is a list of the topics for which the Government requests industry input at the one-on-one sessions: a) the potential inclusion of the Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) restriction on other SMDC/ARSTRAT prime contractors being excluded from competing as a prime contractor on the SMDIS II program; b) the scope of the Draft SOW; c) the personnel categories and personnel qualifications contained in the draft SOW (i.e., are they consistent with industry practices/standards); d) the focus of the draft SOW in regards to the relationship between the SMDIS II program and other SMDC/ARSTRAT multiple-award programs (e.g., STARS and COMETS); e) the performance standards contained in the draft SOW; f) the Governments proposed use of a cost-plus-fixed fee contract type; g) the use or non-use of oral presentations as part of the proposal and evaluation phase of the acquisition; h) the use of sample task orders vice actual task orders to be awarded with the basic contract award; i) the use of a single or reduced Contract Line Item Numbering (CLIN) structure to lessen the need for administrative task order modifications; j) the benefit to SMDC/ARSTRAT of contractor marketed efforts and procedures to ensure Federal Acquisition Regulation requirements (FAR 16.505) concerning competition of task orders under multiple award contracts are satisfied;  k) the use of an SMDC/ARSTRAT Fee-for-Service on task orders placed under the contracts for customers outside of SMDC; and, l) any additional industry recommendations to reduce contract bid and proposal costs and/or streamline the acquisition process. 3.  Release of Draft RFP: the Government intends to release a draft RFP for  industry comment in the late January or early February 2004 timeframe.  The draft RFP will be posted on the SMDC/ARSTRAT internet website at http://www.armyspace.army.mil.  All industry comments pertaining to the draft RFP shall be submitted in writing. The due date for submission of industry comments pertaining to the draft RFP shall be established at a later date and posted with the release of the draft RFP on the SMDC/ARSRAT internet website. 4.  Conduct Second Round of One-on-One Sessions with Industry: the Government intends to conduct a second round of one-on-one sessions with industry after release of the draft RFP and prior to the release of the final RFP.  The Government intends to hold t his second round of one-on-one meetings sometime in the mid February 2004 timeframe.  These one-on-one meetings will be an opportunity for interested contractors to ask questions of the Government and provide any final comments and/or recommendations relat ed to the SMDIS II solicitation and SOW, prior to finalization of the formal RFP.  As with the initial one-on-one industry sessions, these discussions will not be recorded nor published subsequently.  All pertinent recommendations and comments will be inco rporated, as appropriate, into the final RFP, with an outline of the changes made from the draft RFP to the final RFP.  Again, these one-on-one sessions will be limited to four one-hour meetings per day and will be scheduled on a first-come, first-served b asis.  As additional information becomes available, it will be posted to the SMDC/ARSTRAT internet website at http://www.armyspace.army.mil. As stated above, all information pertaining to the SMDIS II acquisition, related market research activities, milestone schedule and formal solicitation documents will be posted to the SMDC/ARSTRAT internet website at (http://www.armyspace.army.mil), as the y become available.  No hard copies of the solicitation documents shall be distributed.  Additionally, the Government will include a link within the website to provide an electronic library of historical information relating to the current SMDIS contracts (e.g., a sanitized copy of an existing SMDIS contract and historical task orders).  To the greatest extent possible, this acquisition shall be paperless.  As such, it will be incumbent upon interested parties to periodically monitor the SMDC/ARSTRAT intern et website for updated acquisition information and documents.  Additionally, the Government will include a link on the website for interested parties to register and obtain information pertaining to other interested parties for the purpose of establishing potential teaming arrangements.  Please note that all subsequent synopsis information will be posted to both the SMDC/ARSTRAT internet website, as well as the Army Single Face To Industry internet website at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi.

<SUBJECT>D--To provide Software Upgrades, Configuration and Annual Maintenance of Computer Aided Job Evaluation (CAJE) Software.
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Link HR Systems Inc, Philadelphia, PA.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the United States Department of State (DOS) Bureau of Human Resources (HR).  The DOS HR department has a requirement for the acquisition of services to provide the annual software maintenance for the Computer Aided Job Evaluation (CAJE) application applications purchased in 2002.  The estimated total value of this project is $500,000.  The Contractor shall provide licensing authorization, help desk and telephone support, software upgrades and new releases, and operational and configuration support. The Department of State, Bureau of Human Resources purchased the Computer Aided Job Evaluation (CAJE) application, known commercially as LinkJE, as a commercial off the shelf product to replace the U.S. Department of State's narrative standards-based job evaluation methodology for local positions of U.S. Embassies abroad..  Link HR Systems Inc. remains the only vendor of the web-based CAJE and/or LinkJE software in North America.  No other vendors or re-sale marketing agents provide licensing or annual maintenance of either the LinkJE or CAJE product applications.   The web-based CAJE application is the only product specifically designed for use by a U.S. Government agency that employs staff in 170 countries worldwide.  The LinkJE product provides the software platform upon which CAJE has been developed.   Considering the sizable investment that the Department has made in the development of the web-based CAJE application, and the functionality requirement to support U.S. government users in 170 countries in 24 time zones on a seven day work week basis, it would not be beneficial for the Department of State to redesign their current application. The removal of the LinkJE systems architecture and features would require a costly redesign of the CAJE application and extensive database migration.  It would also require an extensive implementation program throughout the Department to allow 300 application Users the time and resources for re-training, data migration and user confidence.  The Department of State considers the CAJE application as a mission critical element which streamlines overseas human resources operations and reduces the overall cost of human resources operations at 170 Embassies worldwide.   In order to maintain compatibility and functionality, this procurement must be for software and maintenance of the same type.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST November 14, 2003, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  POC:  Mathew Ridolfi, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions must be emailed  to Mathew Ridolfi at  Mathew.ridolfi@mms.gov.

<SUBJECT>Sole Source Announcement
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) intends to award a sole-source contract to Advanced Programming Concepts, Incorporated (APC) to continue the procurement of development, integration, maintenance and support of Air Defense Systems Integrator (ADSI) code for the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) DII Common Operation Environment (COE) and variants. The purpose of this acquisition is to develop one baselined ADSI version to be modified to meet specific Navy requirements.  As the developer of ADSI, APC is the only responsible source that that can make the required changes to the embedded software and install and upgrade on ships in the timeframe required. The ADSI is an integral part of the U.S. military?s command and control structure.  Since it is imperative that the Navy retain interoperability with other DoD programs and systems the Navy must use the same integrator (ADSI). The period of performance for this procurement will be from March 11, 2004 to March 10, 2005 with four option years to follow.  This request is considered to be sole source to Advanced Programming Concepts, Incorporated and no solicitation will result from this announcement.

<SUBJECT>A -- Research Registry for Neonatal Lupus
<DESC>The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Hospital for Joint Diseases/Orthopaedic Institute (HJD) to extend and expand the scope of their current contract for an additional five (5) years.  The HJD was awarded a contract in September 1994, for the project entitled “Research Registry for Neonatal Lupus.”  The purpose of the contract was to establish a research registry for juvenile neonatal lupus.  The registry currently collects only information sufficient to establish the diagnosis of the disease, and information as to the patient's and/or family's willingness to cooperate in basic and clinical research on the disease.  There is limited collection of blood specimens; collection of other patient materials for research purposes is not currently part of the registry functions.  The overall goal of the registry is to collect sufficient information on individuals and/or families, to allow investigators interested in studying the disease to use the registry data to assist them in obtaining sufficient numbers of patients to pursue their research objectives.  The HJD collects information on mothers whose babies are affected with neonatal lupus syndrome.  The purpose of this extension is two fold.  First, the additional time will allow the incumbent to continue to enroll subjects to expand sample size to assure a robust number of affected children to support genetic analysis of susceptibility and severity  factors.  Second,  the incumbent will pursue a limited expansion of specimen collection to enable genetic studies. The Contractor will maintain a specimen bank for the storage of serum and DNA from all immediate family members (mother and her child/children) with neonatal lupus and unaffected siblings enrolled in the Research Registry.  In addition, where feasible, lymphocytes will be obtained from these family members and EBV transformed to maintain a perpetual resource of DNA.  A determination for the use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The Hospital for Joint Diseases/ Orthopaedic Institute (HJD) is determined to be the only responsible source for the following reasons: (1) the HJD leads a unique national effort dedicated to the collection and characterization of neonatal lupus; (2) the HJD has developed and implemented a system for neonatal lupus based on strict enrollment criteria; and (3) the HJD has unique invaluable resources at its disposal such as 312 mothers and 366 children with neonatal lupus and a collection of blood specimens from the mothers and children. Therefore, the HJD has the unique capability to perform this work.  This is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposals. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in performance make competition for this additional work unfeasible. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NIAMS. A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710.  This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available. See Numbered Note 22.

<SUBJECT>99 -- FedBizOpps Formal Public Announcement of the Streamlined Competition Performance Decision Required by OMB  Circular A-76
<DESC>The Beltsville Area, ARS, has completed a Streamlined Competition for the BARC security services study announced on June 27, 2003.  Security services functions had previously been announced as a Direct Conversion to the private sector prior to the implementation of the revised Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-76, dated May 29, 2003.  The Direct Conversion was converted to a Streamlined Competition in accordance with guidelines contained in OMB Circular A-76.

This competition involved the execution of a Streamlined Comparison Form (SLCF) that compared security services currently performed by government personnel with services provided by the private sector.  The performance decision was certified on October 23, 2003, and resulted in a decision in favor of the private sector provider.  The private sector cost estimate was significantly less than the government's estimate.

A solicitation will be issued on or about mid January 2004 to include the right of first refusal in accordance with the FAR 7.305(c).

<SUBJECT>75 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company’s overall financial status.  

Binder, Vinyl Clad 1-1/2 inch Round Ring (7510-00-NIB-0130, 7510-00-NIB-0145 through -0151: 1 1/2 inch vinyl clad round ring binders in the following colors: blue, red, gray, cinnamon, brown, green, jade and white); Four Month Planner (7520-00-NIB-1689: This dry erase calendar features a silk-screened 4-month calendar to keep track of all scheduled projects.  The 24 x 36 inch board provides ample space for writing important information.  Wallboard has a Melamine finish for each clean up and comes with an office decor, slate-blue frame. Wall hangers and instructions are included.)
In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm's sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

STATEMENT OF WORK
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS              

1. BACKGROUND
 
 The Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Columbus Center (DFAS/CA) performs financial and accounting functions for several governmental agencies conducting various operations throughout the world.  The Center currently has a one-year contract, which expires on December 31, 2003.  The purpose of this solicitation is to open the bidding to interested parties in establishing a long-term contract for a process that allows the Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Columbus Center to continue paying foreign vendors/contractors in a variety of foreign currencies.
 
2. SCOPE

A. Concept of Operations:

1.  Disbursements -

The Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Columbus Center will establish an account(s) with the contract bank.  When processing foreign currency payment(s) to foreign vendors/contractors, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Columbus Center shall notify the contract bank of the impending payment(s).  Upon notification, the contract bank shall purchase the amount of foreign currency required for the payment(s) and provide the Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Columbus Center the exchange rate and U.S. Dollar equivalent.  The Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Columbus Center will process the payment(s) in U.S. Dollars for deposit into an established account for subsequent transfer by the contract bank to the payee in the specified foreign currency.  The contract bank should have the capability of transferring foreign currency via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) or Check/Draft.  The proposed system should eliminate the need for Limited Depository Accounts (LDAs), as outlined in the DoDFMR, Volume 5, Chapter 14.

2.  Erroneous Payments -

In the event an erroneous payment is made, it may be necessary for the contract bank to research the payment and provide copies of documents related to that payment.  If the payment must be voided and collected back into the account, the contract bank must refund the exact U.S. Dollar amount at the exchange rate quoted for the original disbursement resulting in no gain or loss due to exchange fluctuation.   





3.  Collections -

The contract bank should also have the capability of receiving and forwarding collections from debtors.  These would be payments made payable to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Columbus Center in a foreign currency.  The contract bank would receive the foreign currency payments and convert such payments to a U.S. Dollar equivalent for deposit into an account.  The contract bank would then forward the U.S. Dollar amount to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Columbus Center.  The contracted process should have no limitations regarding the volume and dollar amount of Collection transactions being processed by the Contract Bank and forwarded to the Columbus Center.  

4.  Payment Date -

The payment date shall be defined as the date on which foreign currency draft or electronic funds transfer (EFT) payments are dated.  The Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Columbus Center shall establish the payment date in which the foreign currency payment must be made.  The contract bank shall be responsible to ensure the payment is made on the established payment date.  Coordination will be made between the Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Columbus Center and contract bank to ensure funds are on deposit in the account on the payment date.

The Contractor shall be able to lock in a rate for a minimum of ¡§current plus five business days¡¨ for all supported currencies to allow time for transactions to be entered in DoD systems (i.e., entitlement, disbursing, and accounting systems).  The contractor shall also be able to provide an exchange rate that is valid for entire day for all currencies.

B. Disbursing Transactions:
 
The average number of foreign currency transactions for the current Fiscal Year has been 135 transactions per month.  The dollar amount of each transaction may range between $50 to $3,000,000 per transaction. With the consolidation of DFAS Europe to the Columbus Center, an increase in volume is projected to approximately 18,750 transactions a year. The contracted process should have no limitations regarding the volume and dollar amount of Disbursement transactions being processed by the Columbus Center.

C. Fiduciary Relationship:

4.  EVALUATION

A. The primary evaluation factors are listed below in ascending order of importance, unless otherwise indicated.

1. Operational Approach

The offeror shall provide a concise summary in response to Paragraphs 2.A-D  as outlined in this Statement of Work.  The offeror shall also address his/her capability of meeting the transitional requirements specified under Paragraph 2.I.  This section is limited to eight (8) pages, including any addendums, and should address any planned future enhancement to the proposed process. 

	2.  Technical Approach  

The offeror shall provide a list of all support and maintenance functions related to their proposed process as outlined under Paragraphs 2.E-F.  This section is limited to four (4) pages, including any addendums.  

	3.  Cost 

The offeror shall provide a detailed list of all costs associated with the implementation, maintenance and support of the process.  This section should clearly address costs related to items listed under Paragraph 2.G and is limited to four (4) pages, including any addendums.

4.  System Requirements 

The offeror shall provide a concise summary in response to items listed under Paragraph 2.J and is limited to five (5) pages, including any addendums.

	B.	Scoring Method.  The following method will be used in assessing each operational, technical and cost proposal as outlined in this Statement of Work:  

	Outstanding-4	Very significantly exceeds most or all of the requirements.  Response exceeds a "Better" rating.  The Offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality performance is anticipated.

	Better-3	Fully meets all of the requirements and significantly exceeds many of the requirements.  Response exceeds an "Acceptable" rating.  The areas in which the Offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality.

	Acceptable-2	Meets all of the requirements.  Complete, comprehensive, and exemplifies an understanding of the scope and depth of the task requirements as well as the Offeror's understanding of the Government's requirements.

	Marginal-1	Less than "Acceptable."  There are some deficiencies in the technical proposal.  However, given the opportunity for discussions, the technical proposal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least "Acceptable."  (Areas of a technical proposal which remain to be "Marginal" after "Final Revisions" offers shall not be subject to further discussion or revision.)	If award is made on initial offers, there will not be an opportunity for discussions, nor a chance to become at least "Acceptable."

	Unacceptable-0	Technical proposal has many deficiencies and/or gross omissions: Failure to understand much of the scope of work necessary to perform the required tasks; failure to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Government's requirements; failure to meet many of the requirements.  (When applying this adjective to the technical proposal as a whole, the technical proposal must be so unacceptable in one or more areas that it would have to be completely revised to attempt to make it other than unacceptable.)


5.  AWARD - BEST VALUE

	A.	The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from an operational, technical and cost standpoint.  

	B.	Proposals received in response to this solicitation will be evaluated by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Department of Defense Supplement (DFARS).  One contractor will be selected for award on the basis of their proposal being the most advantageous to the Government.    

	C.	All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are equally as important as cost or price.  As such, the Government may elect to pay a price premium to select an Offeror whose operational and/or technical evaluation factors are superior.
