BRAND NAME UNIQUE JUSTIFICATIONFOR BIGIP LTM 6400 V9 LOAD BALANCING DEVICE + MAINTENANCEFA8771-08-R-0016

ACES application servers use secure socket layer traffic as part of an integrated security program which supports the Air Force's Civil Engineers.  It is imperative that the developmental environment matches the operational environment to ensure completeness in testing.   Without the purchase of this hardware and its associated maintenance, the required testing before fielding new software and/or system architecture changes would not be able to take place.  This could adversely affect Civil Engineers Air Force-wide with the introduction of new software and/or system architecture changes that are not thoroughly tested.  The Government's minimum needs can only be satisfied with the purchase of this hardware and maintenance.  This purchase allows the developmental environment to match the operational environment.   A failure to purchase specified hardware and maintenance would prevent the 754 ELSG from meeting current customer requirements of thoroughly tested changes to softwa! re and system architecture.

<DESC><p>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to invite bids on the development and delivery of Increment 1 of the Air Command and Control Information Services (Air C2IS) in Support of Air Staffs.</p>
<p>NC3A is serving as the NATO contracting agency for this project. NC3A intends to use the Optional Preliminary Bidding Procedure. The formal IFB will be preceded by a Request for Bidders Views (RFBV), which will provide the draft IFB documentation to nominated bidders for comments.<br /><br />The estimated value of this project is Euro 11,365,000.00 ($17,865,000.00). The amounts of the bids submitted in response to the IFB shall not exceed 125% of the authorized amount for the project. The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-12556-AirC2IS. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.</p>
<p>Bidding documents, including technical specifications applicable to the bidding and the contractual documents, are expected to be NATO UNCLASSIFIED. Bidders may also be given access to a bidders library that may include material up to the level of NATO SECRET. Performance of the contract will also require that contractors have personnel and facility clearances at the level of NATO SECRET. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the NATO contracting agency the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract.</p>
<p><br />SUMMARY DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The Air C2IS project is intended to provide the common elements of the Air c2IS as a fully integrated component of the Bi-Strategic Command (Bi-SC) Automated Information System (AIS) and to serve as a baseline for future enhancement.</p>
<p>These services are required to complement the Bi-SC AIS core services with an integrated and supported suite of Air C2 services capable of supporting the work of Air staffs at all static and deployable Command Facilities of the NATO Command Structure. The Air C2IS Increment 1 (AirC2IS-1) capability is also envisioned to expose those services and products needed by other Bi-SC AIS functional areas, such as the Air Operations Direct9ive (AOD), Air Space Control Order (ACO), Recognized Air Picture, and reporting of air order of battle information.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Air C2IS Capability Package, it is expected that this project will be implemented based on a Spiral Development approach that will be executed in three increments to complete the Air C2IS capability. Each increment should provide an integral, usable, and operationally-fielded capability.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes awarding a follow-on contract to Hughes Network Systems (HNS), Inc. of Gaithersburg, MD for specialized engineering support, and proprietary software maintenance on the NAS Data Interchange Network II (NADIN II).  This service is presently under contract DTFAWA-03-C-03050 with HNS.
The maximum estimated value of the follow-on contract is estimated to be $900,000 with a minimum estimated value of $5,000 for a per-call software maintenance contract.  The contract duration is expected to be not more then five years.  The FAA Telecommunication Infrastructure (FTI) program will incorporate NADIN II in an estimated two (2) to three (3) years.
Description of NADIN II Services:  NADIN II is a Hughes 9000 Strategy and Radiant equipment Packet Switch Network (PSN) that provides operational Wide Area Network (WAN) services to the NAS community, Department of the Interior, Department of Treasury, Commercial Airline Carriers, and 22 Foreign Countries.  This network was purchased from Hughes Network Systems (HNS), the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), and commissioned in 1995.  NADIN II PSN switching equipment is located at the National Network Control Centers (NNCCs) in Atlanta, GA, Salt Lake City, UT, and in all of the CONUS ARTCCs, Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam.
The NADIN II System supports critical and essential data communications services used by the FAA.  The NADIN II PSN is a network that provides long-haul data communications support for the NAS and consists of 25 packet switching nodes interconnected by T1 and fractional T1 leased backbone links.
Each node contains a packet switch with X.25 and Frame Relay interfaces via RS-232 and EIA-530 physical interfaces.  In addition, the two nodes located at the NNCCs contain network control equipment providing system monitoring and control.  Each node provides communication services to a large number of subscribers and to two or more trunks to other network nodes.
A new vendor would immediately be required to have the qualifications and capabilities to identify NADIN II proprietary software service malfunctions, interruptions and/or failures and provide the required technical assistance to restore telecommunications software services to normal operation.  
The Contractor will provide, on a per-call basis, all labor, supervision, tools, materials (including manuals and schematics and transportation necessary to maintain third-level support to the NADIN PSN software. This will include providing an eight hundred (800) telephone number 8 hours a day, five (5) days a week for support to NADIN PSN users, operators, NADIN Network Control Center (NNCC), and second-level support personnel (AJW-177).  A test bed composed of Strategy 9000 NADIN PSN hardware and software will be maintained as an alternative method of trouble shooting any difficult malfunctions.
If anyone feels they can immediately meet the criteria please contact Dixie Harper at dixie.harper@faa.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Inside Outside Sales, LLC 5188 Old Indian Tr., Fitchburg, WI 53711  

The reference number NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2008-116-DDC. 

The item to be purchase is: Refurbished Lunar PIXI X-ray densitometer with PIXImus software for automated Total Body and manual ROI BONE, lean and fat mass measurement acquisition and analysis. To include the following; new notebook computer minimum specs; Dell Latitude C520, Win XP Pro, 1.7Hz, 512MB RAM, 60GB HD, CD-RW, wireless and 10/100NIC), color desktop printer, 100 specimen trays, QA phantom and user-install video.  A warranty of Ninety days for the PIXI densitometer with a one-year manufacture’s warranty for the computer and printer.  To include inside delivery, and  installation of equipment and removal of ALL debris.

The Government’s estimated expected delivery date is fifteen to thirty calendar days after receipt of the purchase order.

The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Bethesda, Maryland.

The sole source determination is based on the fact that The Lunar PIXImus Densitometer (GE Medical Systems) provides a solution to the aforementioned problems by utilizing a non-invasive procedure of dual-energy, X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The machine provides accurate results of bone and tissue composition from X-ray imaging of the mice in a fraction of the time of traditional methods. A DEXA densitometry also affords the researcher the ability to make multiple in situ measurements during the lifetime of the animal to monitor the long-term effects of the drug or gene.  This could potentially decrease the number of animals used in an experiment.
The Lunar PIXImus is a powerful tool that will surely prove to be indispensable in the Government’s metabolic studies of PDE3 knockout mice.   This equipment has successfully been used in different branches of the institute without significant problems.  It is considered to be the most useful instrument to perform metabolic studies using animal models.  Due to compatibility it is to the government’s best interest to purchase the Lunar PIXImus Densitometer (GE Medical Systems) system from Inside Outside Sales.

Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing.  Size Standard is 500 employees. The small business set-aside does not apply.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  Vendors should regularly access the specified websites to ensure they have downloaded any and all amendments.
The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) requires delivery of, and licenses to use a set of commercial, off-the-shelf, High-Frequency Structure Solver (HFSS) software that is proprietary to Ansoft Corporation at 225 West Station Square Suite 200, Pittsburgh PA 15219.  In accord with the circumstances defined at FAR 6.302-1, in June 2008, the Government intends to award a firm fixed-price order for the required software, non-competitively, to Ansoft Corporation.  
The requirement includes quantity one each of: (1) HFSS, node-locked license, with subscriptions to software maintenance; (2) Multi-processing for HFSS, node-locked license, with subscriptions to software maintenance; (3) Optimetrics (for HFSS, Q3D Extractor, Maxwell), node-locked license, with subscriptions to software maintenance; and (4) Ansoft Links for MCAD (Enables IGES, STEP, and Pro/E-import) for HFSS, node-locked license, with subscriptions to software maintenance.
Non-competitive award is based on the characteristics of the required software.  The basic Required Features of the HFSS modeling and simulation software are:  (1) it performs analysis of high frequency circuits; (2) it models antennas and matching networks; (3) it is interoperable with all existing mechanical and electrical design (CAD) tools already in use by the Hydra Hunter Project; and (4) it develops novel electromagnetic systems and applications.  Additionally, the Government has performed market research and identified that the Ansoft HFSS software is the only modeling and simulation software that provides all of the following required functions:  (1) The software is fully and directly compatible with mechanical and electronics CAD packages used by the Hydra Hunter project; specifically, the Pro/E and SolidWorks CAD packages, as well as the Altium Designer and Mentor Graphics electronic design and analysis tools.  (2) The HFSS software analyzes Hydra Hunter-specific antenna structures and has demonstrated the ability to predict antenna performance with an acceptable degree of fidelity (during evaluation HFSS modeling provided estimates of antenna patterns that proved accurate to within 1dB, and estimates of radiation efficiency accurate to within 10% -- superior to any other product evaluated).  (3) The software can perform simulation tasks with true 3D structure geometries.  (4) The HFSS software models mixed metallic and dielectric structures above finite ground.  (5)  The HFSS software has a simple and self-evident means of representing planar circuits.  (6)  Delivery from date of award is no more than one month.    
Questions and responses should be submitted, in Microsoft Word format, no later than 19 June 2008 to DLGR_NSWC_XDS13@NAVY.MIL and should reference Request for Quote number: N00178-08-Q-3031.  Please include your company CAGE code (if you have one) and please provide POC information with your response.

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Panalytical Instruments for the purchase of an Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) Spectrometer.  US EPA requires this instrument for the quantitative analysis of air particulate samples on thin film media in support of air pollution research, source apportionment, and human exposure programs.The EDXRF instrument must be capable of precise, accurate, and non-destructive analysis of air filters with detection limits ranging from  ng/cm2 to 10 ng/cm2 for most elements heavier than Na including heavy metals.  Data obtained from the EDXRF analyses will be applied in source apportionment, exposure, health effects, visibility, and other environmental studies.  The EDXRF system will provide elemental concentration data to quantify local and regional air pollutant source impacts on ambient air samples.  In addition, the non-destructive nature of EDXRF analyses means that delicate foils and filters can be archived indefinitely or analyzed by other methods.  The above applications require an EDXRF spectrometer that meets the critical performance specifications listed below:Elemental range	The instrument should be capable of analyzing elements in the periodic table at least between Na and U.X-ray Source	The instrument must be equipped with an X-ray tube capable of providing 100kV and up to 24mA to insure efficient excitation of heavy element K-lines up to Hf in the periodic table.  The total power should not be less than 600W and not require an external water chiller to cool the tube.  The instrument must also have the option of being fitted with either a Gd anode tube or a dual target Sc-W tube.Optics	The instrument must have a polarizing optical path for reduction of spectral background.  The optical path must also have the capability to fit up to 15 secondary scattering fluorescence targets for optimal excitation of key elements  across the periodic table.  The choice of available secondary targets that can be fitted to the instrument should include at least the following: Al, CaF2, Fe, Ge, Zr, Mo, Ag, Ce2O3, Al2O3, KBr, W, and Sn.Detector	The instrument shall be fitted with a high resolution solid state Ge detector capable of a resolution of at least 135eV @Mn.   The detector should have an energy range of 0.7 to 100keV.  The detector should be liquid nitrogen cooled for highest resolution and be fitted with a safety sensor to automatically turn off HT to the detector in case  LN2 levels fall below operating levels.Sample Changer	The instrument should be fitted with an integral high-capacity sample changer.  The sample changer should accommodate at least forty-eight  47-mm air filters in individual sample cups. The sample changer must also be capable of being continually added to during a batch analysis for a complete uninterrupted and continuous analysis.Analysis mediums	The instrument must have the option of analyzing air filters in a vacuum environment or a helium environment.Instrument cabinet and power requirements	The instrument should be of robust design with removable panels for easy access for service and be mounted on wheels for mobility.  The instrument should be capable of being powered from a standard 100V wall outlet.Software	The software should be Windows-based and be compatible with Windows 2000 and XP. The software should be designed for easy sample analysis and data retrieval as well as allow for the flexibility of application development by the user.  The software should include at least the following capabilities and functionalities:	? Capability of graphically comparing multiple spectra	? User control of deconvolution parameters	? Blank subtraction capabilities for analysis of particulate air filters	? Full array of matrix correction possibilities including Alphas and Compton correction	? Manual and automatic spectral line overlap correction
Panalytical is the only known source able to satisfy the Government?s requirements.
However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA?s requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 334516.  Please submit your request in writing to Courtney Whiting by e-mail to whiting.courtney@epa.gov.  No telephone requests or request by fax will be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS - U.S. Embassy, Ecuador) has a requirement for the purchase of fifteen (15) portable devices for measuring molecular density, with a power source that allows for use without external hook-ups, remote display and a detection alarm.  Additionally, the CT-30 Kit shall include (15) portable fiber-optic endoscopes with a battery power source, remote display and detection alarm.   The system will be equipped to ensure optimum operation regardless of the climate and external conditions.  This system will be used by Ecuadorian Police & Customs to inspect vehicles & containers for drugs, chemical substances, arms, ammunition, laundered money, and undeclared national and foreign currency at the country’s borders.  The NAS requires equipment that has been field tested by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (DHS/CBP) and that is presently in use by CBP, in order to facilitate tactical training.  The K910B “Buster” and Fiber-Optic Scopes combined form the single-unit CT-30 Kit.  In addition to manufacturing, supplying and delivering the products, the Contractor will also provide a full 1-year warranty, parts and labor included.
NAS ECUADOR – Densimeters & Fiberscopes (CT-30 Contraband Inspection Kit)
Justification & Approval For Other Than Full & Open Competition
It is recommended that the Department of State use other than full and open competition for the acquisition of fifteen (15) portable kits, including devices such as the Model K910B “Buster” (for measuring molecular density) and Fiber-Optice Scopes.  The CT-30 Kit’s devices must be provided with a power source that allows for use without external hook-ups, remote display and a detection alarm.  The system will be equipped to ensure optimum operation regardless of the climate and external conditions.  Additionally, the system will be used by Ecuadorian Police & Customs to inspect vehicles/containers for radioactivity/WMD, drugs, chemical substances, arms, ammunition, laundered money, undeclared national and foreign currency, and human trafficking at the country’s borders and ports.  The estimated cost is $___ & entails a 1-year warranty, including parts & labor.    
Nature and/or description of the action being approved.  To contract with the “only known source” for the manufacture and supply, of the specific brand name products otherwise known as Densimeter Model K910B “Buster” & Endoscopes Model FV-680, combined to form the CT-30 Team Contraband Inspection Kits.  Additionally, the Commercial Item Purchase Order will contain provisions for the Contractor to provide an all parts & labor warranty for one year.   A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs.  The Narcotics Affairs Section, American Embassy Ecuador is initiating this procurement under its US/Central American Security Initiative that targets such areas as narcotics trafficking, human trafficking, and possession/transport of WMD’s whether chemical or radiological. Commonality in tactical training & inspection processes have been established as requirements for each nation in fulfilling their duties under the aforementioned Agreement and the CT-30 Kits, particularly the K910B “Buster” have been utilized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) since 1994.  Accordingly, the CT-30 Kit, consisting of the K910B Model “Buster” densimeter, is the only product that can meet the agency’s needs.    An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.  The K910B dimensions (6”x 3”x 3”), sensitivity, and accompanying density measurement table affords inspectors with a unique ease of handling and reference for ascertaining the presence of hidden contraband.  Similar products available do not satisfy the size, sensitivity, nor density measurement features offered by the Only Known Source’s product.  Additionally, no other firm provides the K910B densimeter along with the Fiber-Optic Endoscopes in a single kit, as does the “only known source”.   A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.  Even though our research (including historical data from CBP, whose current contract with the only known sourcey was awarded after advertising for other sources and receiving none) resulted in this justification that there is only one responsible source who can satisfy the agency requirements, the Contracting Officer will advertise this procurement opportunity in Fed Biz Ops to seek additional competition.
A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  The Only Known Source has confirmed that it will offer Dept. of State/NAS the same pricing that it provides to its most favored customer, Customs and Border Protection under their contract.  Pricing has been confirmed by CBP as significantly lower than pricing offered their commercial customers.  Further, the “most favored customer” status has been provided to the Department of State on a recent transaction for the same items in support of our NAS Office in Mexico City.  A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.  The only remaining market survey will be the Fed Biz Ops advertisement to determine if there are any recently-released products on the market that are equal to the CT-30 Kit.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.  The only other known source offering a similar product, (as indicated by that source) is a foreign-made product that would require a source-origin waiver.  The Known Source’s product is U.S. manufactured and will require no such waiver.  Additionally, recent reviews of the foreign-made product concluded with determinations that performance was not equal and the size requirement was not met.  The foreign product essentially amounts to an “imitation” of the Densimeter only and is not provided with the other essential tools that form the CT-30 Kit.  No sources have expressed an interest in this acquisition nor the previous acquisition recently completed.   The Regional Procurement Support Office will continue to post our requirements in Fed Biz Opps, to determine if other sources have entered the market.   Certifications and Approvals withheld.  JOFOC approved on 6/4/2008 @ appropriate level within the agency.

Failure to deliver by July 1st, 2008 will result in loss of productivity and idling of a contiuned reserach project.  This is not a formal solicitation.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  All responsible parties sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, ot quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantagous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the purchase will be awarded without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on this notice is solely within the descretion of the Government.<BR><BR>The J&A for Other Than Full and Open Competition for your Review:<BR><BR>Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition Justification<BR><BR>1. Description of Action:  Approval is being requested for a new contract to acquire research supplies. This approval is being requested for a new firm-fixed-price contract using R&D funds.<BR><BR>2. Description of Supplies/Services:  We are requesting that Charles River Laboratory will house, breed, and provide 100 MyD88 knockout mice.  Total number of animals to be shipped is 100.  This will approximately take 1 year.  They will perform a complete health monitoring and Helicobacter PCR on a quarterly basis as stated in the contract. The contract amount will be $28,765.50.<BR><BR>3. Reason for Authority Cited:  <BR>Authority Urgent and Compelling Urgency FAR 6.302-2, requiring delivery by July 1st, 2008. Serious injury to the Government will be the end result if the award of a contract is delayed due to the serious loss of productivity and idling of Federal employees.  This is a continuation of an ongoing project we had in place last year with Charles River Laboratory.<BR><BR>4. Actions to Increase Competition:  It is not possible to compete the current acquisition due to the critical and precise nature of the research supplies requested.   Charles River procured the mice from Oriental Bioservice which is the only source available for this type of MyD88 knockout mice and they will continue to maintain and breed by mating scheme homozygous vs. homozygous.<BR><BR>5. Market Research:  Extent and the results of the market research (Urgent and Compelling Urgency FAR Part 10) conducted to identify all qualified sources conducted within the past 30 days:  <BR><BR>The requested knockout mice are required for a DTRA funded research plan, which will allow no substitutions due to the nature of the data we require.   <BR>6.	Other facts:  <BR><BR>a.  Procurement history.  No other contracts relevant to this project have been requested.<BR>b. A statement of work suitable for full and open competition can be developed for this procurement.  It is not being competed because in order to maintain the merit and validity of scientific research, there is only one source that can render the service.<BR>c. Unusual and compelling urgency under FAR 6.302-2: We estimate that the cost to the government for delay or substitution of vendor will be approximately $30,000.  <BR><BR>7.  Technical Certification:  Include the following statement:<BR><BR>I justify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<BR><BR>Typed Name: Dr. Kamal Saikh        <BR><BR>Title:  PI, Department of Immunology		<BR><BR>Signature:  -Signed-<BR>	<BR>8.

<DESC>JNLWP FY09 Technology Broad Area Announcement
NON-LETHAL WEAPONS FY09 APPLIED RESEARCH EFFORTSCategory: A--Research and Development (PROCUREMENTS)Date Published: 9 June 2008 Synopsis:FY09 NON-LETHAL WEAPONS APPLIED RESEARCH BAA 09
SUBMISSIONS DUE 21 July 2008 
OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  
The Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD) is soliciting proposals for research, development, and demonstration of next-generation non-lethal weapons (NLW) and capabilities.  The objective of this BAA is to stimulate applied research, development, and rapid-prototyping of NLW technologies in an attempt to address known NLW capability gaps.  Applied research is systematic study to understand the means to meet a recognized and specific need.  It is a systematic expansion and application of knowledge to develop useful materials, devices, and systems or methods.  It may be oriented, ultimately, toward the design, development, and improvement of prototypes and new processes to meet general mission area requirements.  General applied research focus areas in their relative priority of interest to the JNLWD include:
A.	Non-lethal vessel stopping at extended range B.	Clear a space without entry C.	Non-lethally divert an aircraft in the air or stop and/or disable an aircraft on the groundD.	Individual and crowd behavior in environments where less than lethal force is an optionE.	Human effects/effectiveness and safety thresholds of selected NL stimuli F.	Stimulating academic institutions, both civilian and DoD Academies, in the research and development of NLW concepts.  This includes supporting short-term academic challenges and competitions related to NLW development.  G.	Advanced materials and NL payloads
The JNLWD also expresses specific interest in soliciting proposals for research, development, integration, and demonstration of new payloads that would fulfill the non-lethal requirements of the unattended, autonomous Intelligent Munitions System (IMS).  This interest is closely coordinated with the IMS Program office, which has alternative funding to apply to promising IMS-related proposals.   
Submissions should specifically describe technology and research objectives designed to accomplish the following:
A.  Safely stop or significantly impede the movement of occupied vessels with minimal collateral damage in support of either (or both) the maritime defense and interdiction missions.  Proposed concepts for use in maritime defense missions must prevent vessel from physically approaching within 100 meters.  Proposed interdiction mission concepts must be employable at close ranges (~25 meters) and effective in chase-type scenarios where the targeted vessel is fleeing from the chase platform.  Additionally, concepts incorporating the following characteristics may receive extra consideration:
1.	Safely stop uncooperative vessels, including high-speed planning vessels (i.e., go fast boats), without the need to pre-emplace at the engagement point.2.	Provide the desired standoff distance (>100 meters).3.	Produce universal effects for outboard, inboard, inboard/outboard and jet drive propulsion (including jet skis).  Technologies should address both electronically and non-electronically controlled engine systems.  4.	Affect vessels up to 40 feet in length.5.	Deploy from a variety of vessels, including small boats or large ships, fixed or rotary wing aircraft, or remotely piloted platforms.6.	Reversible effects allowing the targeted vessel to be quickly returned to an operational condition with minimal time to repair and minimal repair cost.  B. Facilitate the clearing of buildings (or simple structures) comprised of 3-5 rooms by friendly forces.  Proposed concepts should ultimately set conditions for safer entry by friendly forces operating in urban terrain by preventing hostile resistance during the task of clearing the building.  Proposed approaches could either disable occupants in place or clear all personnel, both combatants and non-combatants, from the objective building or structure.  Concepts that disable occupants in place shall be of a non-chemical nature.  Proposed concepts must allow for the delivery of effects from a relatively safe distance so that friendly forces will not have to enter the structure in order to initiate effects.  Ideally, the capability will be able to be launched from a range between 2 meters and 90 meters.  The completely reversible effects will be temporary in nature, with (T) of 15 minutes to (O) of 45 minutes.  The effects must minimize collateral damage, remaining localized on the targeted structure and not covering adjacent buildings or open areas.  
C.  Safely divert an aircraft in the air or stop and/or disable an aircraft on the ground. The JNLWD requires a systems engineering based study to address the full scope of potential technologies and/or approaches to resolve these non-lethal counter-material capability gaps.  The primary focus of the divert an aircraft task is to control the airspace and enforce no-fly or restricted flight zones. Effects should be focused on the aircraft, not the pilot or other personnel on board. The capability should enable the enforcement of flight restriction zones (e.g., metropolitan Washington, D.C.), protection of critical infrastructure and other high value assets from a possible aerial threat.  For aircraft on the ground, stop requires the aircraft to come to 0 mph at some point between when it starts to taxi and when it reaches abort speed.  The requirement to disable includes actions to render inoperable, deny use, and/or deny access to an aircraft on the ground.  Successful accomplishment of either objective results in keeping the targeted aircraft from becoming airborne.  Additionally, concepts incorporating reversible effects which allow the targeted aircraft to be quickly returned to an operational condition with minimal time to repair and minimal repair cost may receive extra consideration.  
D.  Conduct systematic studies to enhance understanding and management of individual and crowd behavior in environments where less than lethal force is an option. Data should support development of relationships and behavioral rules that relate physiological insult to behavioral response.  Investigations should focus on:
1.	Historical study of military and law enforcement interaction with individuals and crowds to understand the cause/effect behaviors of the crowd, how the military or law enforcement forces dealt with the situation, and the resulting outcomes (positive and negative).
2.	Human effects and effectiveness studies to examine individual and group/crowd behavioral responses when no NLW is employed vice when a currently fielded NLW such as blunt impact, electro-muscular disruption, or riot control agents is employed.  Predicted behavioral responses for new or conceptual NLW employment in individual and group/crowd scenarios should also be addressed.
Knowledge gained should support development of techniques and tools for non-lethal weapons training, tactical experimentation, and mission planning.  
E.  Conduct systematic studies to analyze the human effects/effectiveness and safety thresholds of selected stimuli for non-lethal effects.  Investigations should focus on one of the following:
1.	Analysis of optical stimulus for significantly enhanced day time effectiveness over current non-lethal technology/prototypes/weapons.  Resulting technology should have potential for development into a militarily useful NLW form factor (i.e. size, power requirements, weight, range, etc.).
2.	Examination of the bioeffects of high power microwaves for non-lethal counter-personnel applications. 
3.	Studies of thermal laser effects for non-lethal application.  Research should consider various wavelengths that propagate well though the atmosphere (not limited to the 2.0 micron wavelength) and focus on understanding reversible health effects, pulsing methods, and effectiveness through clothing. 
4.	Studies of the human effects/effectiveness, similar to the thermal repel effect produced by 95GHz millimeter wave radiation, but at higher millimeter wave frequency waveforms.  
F.  Explore discovery and invention related to non-lethal weapons technology and research via advanced academic research institutions (includes U.S. colleges and universities and military academic institutions). 
G.  Identify and demonstrate the ability of advanced materials or new payloads to provide new or enhanced non-lethal counter-personnel or counter-material capabilities. Examples of advanced materials and payloads include combustion engine modifiers/inhibitors, rigid foams, anti-traction materials, super adhesives, launchable nets or entangling nets, smart nano-materials, and morphing materials, among others.
H.  Fulfill the non-lethal requirements of the unattended, autonomous Intelligent Munitions System (IMS).  General research goals include efforts to:
1.	Non-lethally counter personnel and/or vehicles using the IMS Dispenser Module (DM) as the payload carrier.  The NL payload shall fit within the DM footprint of 24L x 24W x 14.5H.  Total volume available is approx 7390 cu in.  
2.	Non-lethally counter personnel and/or vehicles using the IMS DM as the control source for a NLW.  NLWs would not be part of the DM footprint but a stand alone effect that receives a fire command from the DM and must interface to the SPIDER Mission Adapter Module (MAM) connection or current Miniature Grenade Launcher DM ports.
3.	For both capabilities described above: counter-vehicle concepts should be effective on civilian-class vehicles; NLWs must be effective in all terrain and allow activation via autonomous/manual means.  
PROGRAM SCOPE: 
The scope of this program is intentionally broad to address the wide spectrum of desired operational end-points that the funded investigations will strategically support.  All research is intended to have the common objective of addressing the technology/ knowledge gaps described above.  Strategically, this research will support the development of a family of next-generation NLWs to meet the capability gaps documented in the Joint NLW Capability Based Assessment.  In addition to the data and technological gaps identified above, research supported by this BAA is intended to enable technology to overcome the current limitations of existing NL systems.  These limitations generally include but are not limited to:
1)	Range, coverage (volume of fire), accuracy and precision.2)	Effectiveness and the ability to quantify it.3)	Providing a universal, repeatable and robust NL effect.4)	Target safety, particularly across a wide-spectrum of the population.5)	Deployability, to include weight and volume.6)	Employability, to include use in complex urban environments.7)	Military effectiveness and utility in complex operating environments such as within crowds, within rooms and buildings, and within vehicles and vessels.EVALUATION CRITERIA: Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria in descending order of importance: 1)	Quality and Technical Merit. 2)	Contributions/Relevance to Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP) and Department of Defense (DoD). 3)	Capabilities, Experience, and past performance. 4)	Plans and Capabilities to Accomplish Technology Transfer.5)	Total Cost and Cost Realism. NOTE: Cost realism will be used as an evaluation criterion only in proposals which appear to the reviewers to have significantly under or over estimated the cost to complete the effort. All awards made in response to this BAA will be subject to availability of government funds. Evaluations and selection or non-selection of proposals for funding will be made on the basis of the evaluation criteria listed and the overall balance considered most advantageous to the JNLWP. GENERAL INFORMATION: The JNLWD has available approximately $1.6 million for FY09 for applied research science and technology funding and a comparable amount of additional RDT&E funding. Multiple awards typically of 12-36 month duration are anticipated. Offerors should prepare proposals with a baseline period of performance of 12 months and with one or two options each with a 12-month period of performance and with anticipated contract award dates of December 2008. The 12-month baseline or Phase I of the proposal shall have as a minimum two (2) system or NLW capability demonstrations or program evaluation milestones within the first 12 month period of performance so as to provide data/evidence/support for consideration for option year funding.  This BAA will remain open until  31 January 2009. Technical proposals are not to exceed eight pages and must be accompanied by a full cost proposal valid until 31 January 2009 and one QUAD-Chart (the cost proposal and the Quad-Chart are not part of the eight page limit). Format for the Quad chart is provided in the Proposer Information Packet.  Offerors must submit their technical proposal, the Quad-Chart, and their full cost proposal to the administrative address for this BAA in electronic format commensurate with a Microsoft Office software product (e.g., Word, Excel, or PowerPoint).  It is the policy of the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD) to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. Nondisclosure notices notwithstanding, employees of JNLWD and support contractor, American Systems, may handle proposals for administrative and evaluation purposes; however, only Government evaluators will make final selection recommendations under this BAA.This announcement, in conjunction with the pamphlet BAA 09 Proposer Information Package (PIP), constitutes the Broad Agency Announcement as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). Addresses for obtaining the PIP are provided at the end of this notice. A formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement will not be issued. Requests for same will be disregarded. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. In addition, the Government reserves the right to award multiple contracts, grants, or other instruments determined to be of benefit to the government in achieving the goals and objectives of this program. Awards are subject to the provisions of the FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any other JNLWP and/or Marine Corps contracts through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports and identify the prime contract number. Affirmation shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission. All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in the FAR 9.501, must be disclosed. The disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict. This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit proposals, which will be evaluated. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research related to Non-Lethal Weapons developments. ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION: Offerors are required to obtain a pamphlet, BAA 09 Proposer Information Package (PIP) which will be made available to industry through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program website: https://www.JNLWP.com.  The PIP provides further information on proposal format, the submission process, evaluation and funding processes, and other general information. Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  All administrative correspondence or questions on this BAA should be directed to the following email address:  Peggy.L.Smith1@usmc.mil

The 377th Contracting Squadron is seeking expressions of interest having the capability to provide engineering and technical writing support to the Air Force Safety Center (AFSC), Kirtland AFB, NM. The effort required under this PWS is to provide engineering and technical writing support for the DEW at the AFSC. The AFSC, in conjunction with the Department of Defense Explosive Safety Board (DDESB), has initiated an effort to develop safety standards for new weapons systems like Directed Energy Weapons system. The first step in this process is to develop a plan to review current standards and their applicability, identify gaps that need be filled and how, and also to put forth an initial plan that prioritizes which DEW safety standards should be addressed and developed further. These standards are required to support future Air Force and joint weapons safety certification for DEW. Additionally, because of the expertise of the DDESB, the initial effort will focus on chemical lasers. The minimum qualification for this position is a Senior Scientist or Senior Engineer, a Masters degree from an accredited institution, and documented Directed Energy and Safety experience. Resumes of possible candidates are required with proposal submission. Interviews with potential candidates are at the discretion of the AFSC. The place of performance for this service can be either at the contractor's facility or at the Air Force Safety Center, 9700 G Street SE, Building 24499, Kirtland Air Force Base, NM. If work is accomplished at the AFSC, the following conditions shall be met: Contractor personnel at this facility are subject to a National Agency check. The Government will provide a work area, computers, software, other equipment, telephone access, office supplies and e-mail for employees performing this task. Personnel may be collocated with Government employees. The contractor shall provide the final report summarizing the services provided under this contract. The final product shall consist of an electronically transmitted copy of DEW plan via e-mail to the AFSC and a hard copy on CD rom. It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded.

All questions must be emailed to dfr9@cdc.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />

<DESC>The purpose of the proposed contract, Modernizing Medicaid: Quality Measurement Analysis is to provide information for conducting a comprehensive evaluation of health plan performance. The contract will provide CMS with audited Medicaid Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) health plan data and support Medicaid stakeholders in their efforts to establish quality improvement goals through the use of standardized, audited and comparable performance information. The primary data source for this analysis will be HEDIS results already in National Committee for Quality Assurance’s (NCQA) HEDIS database that have undergone a HEDIS Compliance Audit. Additionally, the contractor will reach out to those health plans that do not currently report to the HEDIS database.  

HEDIS is a standardized measurement system that specifies how health plans collect, audit and report data on their performance in care and service areas ranging from child and adolescent immunization status, to helping patients control their cholesterol and enrollee satisfaction. In 1993, NCQA released HEDIS 2.0 that quickly became the “industry standard” performance measurement set. NCQA maintains and evolves HEDIS specifications and data collection protocols. Since 1997, Medicare, Medicaid and commercial HEDIS results from health plans have been collected on a nationwide basis by NCQA. Since its inception, NCQA has been a leader in health care quality assessment. NCQA operates as an independent, not-for-profit organization and does not represent the exclusive interests of any single constituency. 

Required Firm Capabilities

Firm must be a leader in health care quality measure development and quality assessment through the usage of HEDIS standardized tools.  Firm must have access to the full range of submitted HEDIS data including those that publicly release data and those that do not. Experience working with Medicaid constituency including State Medicaid programs, Medicaid health plans and External Quality Review Organizations (EQROs).

<DESC>NASA intends to award a sole-source contract extension to Perot Systems (formerlyQSS Group, Inc.) pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in supportof Ames Research Center's (ARC) Code JT, Applied Information Technology Divison.  Theobjective is to extend the performance period.The current Contractor provides the following mission critical support services underARC's Ames Consolidated Information Technology Services (ACITS):  Information Technology(IT) Systems and Facilities, Network/Communications Systems, Business Systems, ScientificComputing Systems, and Outreach/Informational Systems.In conjunction with the Agency Chief Information Officers (CIOs) requirement to definethe strategic role of Information Technlogy (IT) for NASA, an Agency IT Strategic Plan isbeing prepared that will encompass IT governance, enterprise architecture, knowledgemanagement, and security of Agency information assets and knowledge.  It is anticipatedthat this plan will serve to formulate an Agency-wide policy regarding these areas andcould significantly impact pending IT acquisitions, particularly the ACITS follow-onprocurement. This extension will allow the necessary time to define a competitivefollow-on procurement based on the agency-wide policy.	In addition the extension willallow for a continuation of services to ensure program continuity and critical missionsupport and avoid significant technical impacts while a competitive follow-on isdeveloped.  The extension will increase the current task task NNA04AA18B value and extend the periodof performance for a period of 14.5 months, from October 15, 2008 through December 31,2009. The current contractor, Perot Systems is considered the only contractor that canmeet ARCs needs given the short period of performance for the extension.  Award toanother source at the same time the recompete is being restructed would result insubstantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recoveredthrough competition of the extension as well as unacceptable delays in fulfilling ARCsrequirements.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:00 PM. PST on June30, 2008. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose ofdetermining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Adetermination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Questions regardingthe extension can be sent via email to Ameka Ali at ameka.ali-1@nasa.gov.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Special Notice SN 08-38 

The Government intends to issue a broad agency announcement to a limited number of potential sources for one potential contract award.  Those eligible to receive the broad agency announcement are Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company Advanced Development Programs (LM ADP) and Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems (NGES) based on their unique qualifications as demonstrated in Phase 1 and Phase 2 of The Integrated Sensor Is Structure (ISIS) Program and market investigatigations into this technical area.
 
The Limited Source BAA is for Phase 3 of the ISIS Program.  The ISIS Program is developing a radar of unprecedented proportions that is fully integrated into a station-keeping stratospheric airship.  The ISIS Objective System performance supports the nation’s need for persistent wide-area surveillance, tracking, and engagement of all time-critical air and ground targets.  Automated surveillance and tracking includes all air targets to the radar horizon of 600 km and all ground targets to a range of 300 km.  The radar aperture also provides track data and other communications directly to users in-theater.  The Objective System logistical concept resembles a cross between a satellite system – launch from a CONUS location, minimum 10 year post-launch operational lifetime, and is not recoverable – and an unattended air vehicle (UAV) which autonomously keeps station for 10 years with a 99% availability in the final year.  No support personnel or facilities are required in-theater.

Under Phase 3 of the ISIS Program, a sub-scale Demonstration System will be designed, fabricated, tested, and demonstrated.  This Demonstration System will be scalable or traceable to the Objective System in terms of design, component technologies, manufacturing technologies, and operational performance.  Successful fabrication and testing of the Demonstration System will reduce Objective System risk to a level acceptable for transition throughout the DoD.

DARPA/CMO  intends to award a contract by other than full and open competition in accordance with Subpart 6.302-1 to one of the two eligible BAA recipients.  Only a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

This notice is NOT a request for competitive proposals outside of the two eligible participants, who will receive the actual broad agency announcement directly after 15 days of the publication of this notice.

Questions should be directed to DARPA  in writing via email to: BAA08-47@darpa.mil or via facsimile at (703) 741-0232.

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.   If no written responses are received at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this response, the purchase will be awarded without further notice.

INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS

FAR 52.212-1 Instructions of Offerors – Commercial Items  (Nov 2007) 

(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees. 
(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show— 
(1) The solicitation number; 
(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers; 
(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; 
(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary; 
(5) Terms of any express warranty; 
(6) Price and any discount terms; 
(7) “Remit to” address, if different than mailing address; 
(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(l) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically); 
(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments; 
(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and 
(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. 
(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. 
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender’s request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing. 
(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. 
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. 
(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and— 
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or 
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or 
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. 
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. 
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. 
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. 
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. 
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. 
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.

INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS

FAR 52.212-1 Instructions of Offerors – Commercial Items  (Nov 2007) 

(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees. 
(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show— 
(1) The solicitation number; 
(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers; 
(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; 
(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary; 
(5) Terms of any express warranty; 
(6) Price and any discount terms; 
(7) “Remit to” address, if different than mailing address; 
(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(l) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically); 
(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments; 
(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and 
(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. 
(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. 
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender’s request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing. 
(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. 
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. 
(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and— 
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or 
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or 
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. 
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. 
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. 
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. 
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. 
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. 
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer. 
(i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation.

<DESC>The Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), under the Department of Homeland Security, seeks 40 (forty) healthy head of cattle within the weight range of 400 lbs. to 500 lbs. to be delivered to Orient Point, New York, on Thursday, July 10, 2008.

For this competitive, best value procurement, Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) certification of the Supplier's facilities may convey some assurance of an acceptable source. In addition, the Supplier must ensure and demonstrate that the animals, in particular younger animals, are not overly stressed and fatigued, for instance, as a result of prolonged transportation, which could compromise the animals' immune systems. Furthermore, in order to minimize any variability between tests, the cattle should come from a homogeneous source without having co-mingled with other cattle. Any exception to this requirement must be documented and explained.

Prior to departure for Orient Point and PIADC, the Supplier shall verify that each head of cattle has had a veterinary examination along with the appropriate vaccinations (example Bovishield) and boosters as necessary as well as antibiotics prior to transport to prevent any in transit fever. Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Supplier, each animal shall be issued a health certificate for interstate transportation. Also, the Supplier shall submit a document with the recent medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments for each animal. This report shall include, at a minimum, general information identifying the animal by number/ID; the departure date of transport to Orient Point/Plum Island; breed; gender; age or birth date range; (de)horned; weaned; castrated (if applicable); the dates and dosages for vaccines and anti-parasitic, anti-fungal, antibiotic drugs; any other tests and corresponding results; and any other interesting and important information. Accurate and consistent with the medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments mentioned above, all animals must be:

-	Holsteins;
-	castrated males;
- 	healthy with no overt signs of disease;
- 	free of active lameness, respiratory disease, warts, or ringworm;
-	polled or dehorned;
-	tolerant of being haltered (i.e. of tractable temperament and be free of behavioral vices such as charging and kicking); and
-	free of external parasites and have been treated for internal parasites within the last three (3) months (preferably using Ivermectin).

Additional requirements are as follows:

-	the cattle must have un-pigmented (i.e pink) tongues;
-	the hooves of the cattle shall be trimmed prior to shipment; and
-	the ears of the cattle shall be notched for Bovine Virus Diarrhea (BVD).

After notification of award, the Supplier shall deliver (F.O.B. Origin) the cattle, and corresponding documentation to the USDHS/S&T/PIADC Warehouse, 40550 Route 25, Orient Point, NY 11957 at approximately 7:30 a.m. on Thursday, July 10, 2008. Utilizing a PIADC-owned wooden animal stockade ramp, available at the Orient Point destination, the Supplier shall offload the cattle from their vehicle then load the animals onto a U.S. Government vehicle.

Once the Supplier hands over the cattle to PIADC personnel at Orient Point, the animals will be quarantined and evaluated for seven (7) calendar days. Any animal that has been delivered but does not meet the criteria listed above or otherwise is considered by PIADC personnel to be unhealthy will be rejected and euthanized. PIADC personnel will inform the Supplier and prepare an animal incident report and send it, by fax or e-mail or both, to the Supplier promptly (within approximately three (3) calendar days, if reasonable and practicable). Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Supplier, and pending the resolution of any inquires or disputes, the Supplier shall compensate PIADC with an appropriate replacement of cattle for any unacceptable animal(s) following the quarantine and evaluation period.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 1:  This amendment is to provide clarification only.  The listed close date pursuant to FBO was noted as May 16, 2008.  However, there is one place in the electronic solicitation which notes 7 days from posting.  Due to confusion the OCC has decided to extend the due date to 12:00noon EST on Monday, May 19.  All quotes will be due at that time.

-	warehouse labor costs 
 vs. drop ship within 2 hour JIT (just in time) timeframe? 	Ready to Post	No.

44	Under the Instructions to Offerors, page 55, it states that the contractor is to provide a copy of the parts/supply catalog.  Is it expected that the successful contractor will provide both the staffing and the parts/supplies?  I am a little confused on this requirement as on page 40 it is stated that the contractor will procure the products (which supports the catalog requirement on page 55) but the second to last paragraph on page 40 states that the government will provide the inventory to stock the warehouse.  Please confirm:  Does the contractor need to be a supplier of both labor and parts for use on this contract?
	To be answered	
45	Are the current NIH employees who staff the Bethesda warehouse eligible for hire by the contractor?   If yes, are the salary levels of these employees available?	To be answered	
46	Is staffing required at all 5 of the facilities discussed or only at the Bethesda campus warehouse?	Ready to Post	Staffing at Bethesda warehouse only.
47	How many NIH staff currently run the Bethesda campus warehouse?	To be answered	
48	Are the FHE units propane or electric power?	To be answered	
49	Is it assumed that the CMMS is being used to manage and account for the inventory at this time?	To be answered	
50	If the inventory is currently tracked within CMMS, are critical/reorder points levels hard coded into the system to prompt the acquisition of additional inventory?	To be answered	
51	Section 5.9 states that the Contractor is responsible for procuring replacement inventory to maintain acceptable levels.  Further down in the same section, it is stated that the Government will provide the inventory required to stock the warehouse. Does this mean that the Contractor will be required to order replacement parts but the bill will be paid by the Government for the parts/supplies that ordered?	To be answered	
52	Section C-6, 6.1:  The statement is made that “If the item is defective, the Contractor shall be responsible for returning it to the manufacturer and debiting the NIH cardholder’s account for items returned as defective or faulty”.  Does this mean that the Contractor will be responsible for processing credit card payments and refunds?  Please elaborate on any financial or money handling transactions that are a requirement of this effort.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and

<DESC>**Due to emergent US Navy requirements and funding issues, the effort described below has been reduced from the original estimate of $14 million to $1.8 million.  Accordingly, as described below, the scale of the effort has been reduced and the response time extended to 23 Jul 2008.**


The Naval Air Warfare Center (Aircraft Division) Patuxent River, MD, seeks engineering support for the design, development, testing, and aircraft integration of an externally mounted airbag system for rotary platforms. The external airbag protection system is intended to greatly reduce the potential of occupant injury from abrupt decelerations associated with a crash impact. The system is also expected to greatly reduce airframe damage from impact whose predominant component is in the vertical direction.


The system is expected to deploy automatically during an emergency situation in which a moderate to high energy crash impact is eminent. Without aid of any other vertical energy absorbing devices, the system is expected to reduce occupant injury in mishaps with a vertical impact velocity of 12 to 37 feet per second (fps). Below 12 fps the energy absorption inherent in the airframe design is expected to be sufficient to prevent occupant injury and serious airframe damage. Above 37 fps, the system, due to the severity of the event, will demonstrate a gradual decrease in its ability to prevent occupant exposure to abrupt decelerations. The system should also be capable of providing occupant and airframe protection in moderately energetic combined velocity and attitude conditions.


The system is expected to remain operational during and after being subjected to a wide range of operating conditions. Examples include exposure to: high temperature, low temperature, aircraft induced vibration, mechanical shock, lightning strikes, rain, dust, salt fog, changes in atmospheric pressure, aircraft fluids, cleaning solutions, and magnetic fields. RTCA/Document-160 provides more detail on the operating conditions that the system will be expected to survive and function in without damage.


Responses shall address the work required supported by a detailed work breakdown schedule (WBS) for  system design, development, and integration onto the TH-57 / Bell 206B Jet Ranger III helicopter. The response shall include activities required to develop a preliminary design for the Control Unit that incorporates crash detection as well as crash prediction capabilities. It is expected that signals from external sensors will be used to predict whether or not a crash impact is imminent while the signals from internal sensor will be used to actuate safety devices in response to a crash.  The response shall include 
 an inflator performance specification that is consistent with performance requirements previously derived from computer generated modeling and simulation.  The Inflator Performance Specification must be consistent with the System Performance Specification and provide a conceptual design that includes the inflator’s dimensions, estimated weight, construction, proposed propellant type (must select Navy approved propellants and initiators), and estimated pressure versus time output performance.  


The response shall include an Airbag Module Performance Specification that is consistent with performance requirements previously derived from computer generated modeling and simulation and the System Performance Specification.  During this effort, the contractor is expected to propose airbag fabric, bag construction, vent concept as well as provide estimates for bag dimensions and overall weight.  A system and component level development plan shall be tailored to include all safety of flight policies, procedures and protocols for installation of this system onto the Navy’s TH-57. 


This effort will require a wide range of laboratory experiments, component level tests, and integrated system level tests to demonstrate suitability of the system to progress to increasingly higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs). At completion, the system is expected to have achieved a TRL of 6 (i.e. demonstration in a realistic environment).


The work described in this synopsis is expected to require approximately 1year (12 months) to complete. During this period, the contractor is expected to provide monthly electronic status reports in addition to a final report and support regularly scheduled technical interchange meetings. Furthermore, the contractor is also expected to provide written reports detailing the outcome of experimental results and studies.


It is anticipated that a sole source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract will be awarded to BAE Systems, 7822 South 46th Street, Phoenix, AZ 85044-5354. BAE Systems has already completed preliminary research and development of this system and the Government intends to negotiate solely with BAE to continue development. The estimated value of this requirement is $1.8 million. Responses to this synopsis should be sent via e-mail to Amber.F.Wood@navy.mil before 23 July 2008.


Numbered Note 22 applies to this announcement.
