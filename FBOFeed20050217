<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis.  Electronic Systems Center (ESC) is seeking qualified sources for the acquisition of a Non-Developmental Item (NDI) Ground Multi-band Terminal (GMT).  Detailed requirements for this system are defined in the Capabilities Document and can be found at http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil. Although the acquisition strategy has not been finalized, all potential offerors will be required to provide a complete NDI GMT and certify to the Government that it meets the requirements in the Capabilities Document as part of the source selection evaluation process between June and September 2005. This Sources Sought Synopsis is issued to assist the Government in determining industry’s interest and their capability in satisfying the requirements of the GMT program.  Interested firms must provide two hard copies of a qualification package detailing your specific capabilities to GIGSG/CMK, 202 Burlington Road, MITRE Building D, Bedford, MA 01730, Attn: Peter Lewis at (peter.lewis@hanscom.af.mil). Please limit your qualification package to a maximum of 10 pages. Responses are requested no later than 1:00 pm EST on 18 March 2005.

The Government will notify prospective offerors who submit a qualification package that did not meet the terms of this sources sought. The Government is also interested in industry input regarding the establishment, implementation and management of incentives based on operational performance of the terminal in the field.  The Government’s goal is to improve operational availability, equipment reliability, and response cycle time.  Please identify those incentives or other processes you believe would further our goal of improving operational performance of the terminal in the field.

<DESC>The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that reduce homeland vulnerabilities. HSARPA is the external funding arm for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate. HSARPA performs these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), government laboratories, and academic institutions. 

HSARPA seeks to develop, test, and commercialize a new set of laboratory-based or portable detection methods for use on the food supply system. Food detection systems will require rapid, high-confidence detection of microbial and toxin threats in order to enable advanced strategies to protect individuals from exposure and reduce contamination of critical food supply infrastructure. 

HSARPA intends to initiate the Food Biological Agent Detection Sensor (FBADS) Program, which seeks to develop, test, and transition cost-effective detection methods for use on the food system, with a focus on liquid substrates. Specifically, HSARPA is looking for portable or laboratory-based detection methods that can be used at food manufacturing facilities, or before the food enters a processing or production facility. The FBADS Program will develop optimized detection systems characterized by the following capabilities: 
• Low Limit of Detection; 
• Extremely low probability of false positive (Pfp); 
• Low probability of false negatives (Pfn); 
• Automated operation, easily used by non-technical personnel; 
• Rapid analysis time; and 
• Low total cost of ownership 

The FBADS initiative responds to Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-9, “Defense of United States Agriculture and Food”, January 30, 2004. We anticipate that the detection systems developed under this FBADS Program will provide DHS with a capability to prevent any wide-spread harm to our nation’s critical food infrastructure.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, FL (NSWC PC) intends to award a sole source contract to Sperry Marine of Charlottesville VA for procurement of  ten (10) Bridgemaster E radar systems and operating licenses. This acquisition is not suitable for full and open  competition for the following reasons. NAVSEA has conducted an extensive qualification program for manufacturers of LCAC radar systems and has determined that it is necessary to purchase the same radars for the Non-SLEP craft as the SLEP craft. Currently the Bridgemaster E radar system, originally manufactured by Sperry Marine, has been installed on all completed SLEP LCACs and has been installed on some of the non-SLEP (pre LCAC-61) LCACs. This radar system, as previously installed, is integrated into the SLEP navigation hardware and software that will form the basis for the NDI replacement gear. Any other radar system would require extensive re-development, testing and qualification costs, and duplic! ating the logistics train established for the SLEP LCACs. Sperry Marine, as the OEM, is the only known source for this equipment. Note 22 applies.

This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  The Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Vehicle was first delivered in 1984 and had a service-life design of 20 years.  Currently, the Navy has a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for the LCAC.  Under SLEP, the LCAC will enter the 21st century with markedly improved performance and an increased life span.  The interface boards specified are compatible with existing Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) equipment and are the only interface boards that are 100% compatible with the existing LCAC SLEP equipment.  Use of another company’s interface boards may introduce new or chan! ge existing parameters that may do more harm than good to the LCAC system.  Failure of the LCAC system could result in loss of life as well as significant damage and maybe even loss of fleet assets.

<CONTACT>Elaine Flick Contracting Officer 3032363528     Elaine_Flick@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is currently teaming with the USDA Forest Service (FS), for a combined requirement to replace and improve two separate and distinct agency Smokejumper (SMJ) parachute deployment systems, with a single common system for adoption by both agencies.  The BLM and FS Fire Management programs will utilize the new SMJ Parachute System to aerially deliver Smokejumpers to wild land fire incidents under the following conditions: parachuting into remote wild land areas and landing in open fields or meadows where a variety of surface features will be encountered (to include grass, brush or snow ground cover, hard, soft, wet, or dry surface conditions); parachuting into small or confined landing areas that are surrounded by trees; parachuting into sites with mission specific equipment attached to the parachute harness system; parachuting into mountainous areas that may include any of or a combination of the conditions previously referenced; with Smokejumper experience levels varying from 0 to 600 jumps.  The New SMJ Parachute System basic design shall be a non-developmental, commercially available product.  The New SMJ Parachute System must be flight proven.  Some design adjustments to the basic design will be acceptable to meet the requirements of the specification released with the Solicitation.  The New SMJ Parachute System shall include the required Main Canopy Sub-assembly, Reserve Canopy Sub-assembly, Pack/Harness Sub-assembly, CYPRES Automatic Activation Device (to be provided as GFE) Sub-assembly, and components such as risers, bridles, deployment bags, pilot chutes, cushioning and hardware necessary for a fully operational and safe parachute ready for jumping in Static Line configuration.  It shall meet requirements of the specification at the time of proposal submission, and shall retain this certification throughout deliveries, testing and its entire life.  The harness and container assembly must be compatible with a variety of appropriate main and reserve canopies.  Due to the need to integrate the requirements of two agencies, and multiple Smokejumper bases, the proposal and evaluation process will involve multiple phases.  All vendors who believe they meet the technical requirements of the solicitation, estimated to be released on or about February 25, 2005 will be invited to submit technical proposals on or around March 18, 2005.  Technical proposals will be evaluated based on criteria identified in the Solicitation and those vendors who make the competitive range will be invited to submit one (1) complete assembly and one (1) representative representing their firm to the Government for the Phase II Ground Evaluation.  Assemblies will be evaluated based on Ground Evaluation criteria identified in the Solicitation, and those vendors who make the competitive range will be invited to submit a price proposal, four (4) complete assemblies, for the Phase III Jump Evaluation.   Assemblies will be evaluated based on Jump Evaluation criteria identified in the Solicitation and the vendor who is deemed to represent the best value to the government, considering technical, past performance, and price, will be awarded a contract for a minimum of 60 complete assemblies with options for 1,000 to 1,500 additional units or sub components to be purchased over four option years.  Options will be exercised contingent upon the results of a field evaluation that will occur in the 2006 Fire Season.  Due to the complexities of the proposal and evaluation process, a Pre-proposal conference will be held in Denver one week after the Solicitation has been posted, on or about March 4, 2005.  The approximate milestone schedule for this acquisition is as follows: (1) Solicitation released 2/25/05; (2) Pre-proposal conference in Denver 3/4/05; (3) Technical Proposal due date 3/25/05; (4) Phase I Technical Evaluation in Denver 3/28/05 to 4/1/05; (5) Phase II Ground Evaluation 5/2/05 to 6/10/05; (6) Phase III Jump Evaluation 8/1/05 to 9/30/05; (7) Contract Award 10/28/05; (8) Receipt of 60 complete assemblies 2/10/06; (9) Phase IV Field Test Summer 2006 Fire Season; (10) Option Exercise for up to 1,500 additional assemblies over four years 2007 through 2010.  The proposed contract is unrestricted and will be awarded on a firm-fixed price basis as an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity contract with a base year and four options.  Offerors will be requested to visit the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to download a copy of the solicitation.  A written copy of the solicitation will not be made available.  All offerors are reminded that in order to be eligible for contract award registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://www.ccr.gov/ is required.  Any questions about this requirement in advance of the solicitation release date, should be directed to Elaine E. Flick, Contracting Officer, at 303-236-3528 or elaine_flick@blm.gov.

<CONTACT>Luis Maestas Contracting Officer 3032361832     Luis_Maestas@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Contractor(s) shall be required to provide assistance to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), in the State of Idaho for assessment, correction, and monitoring of physical hazards not associated with hazardous materials.  Physical hazards general include:  unsafe roads, trails, buildings; geologic hazards; abandoned mine hazards; caves; diversion and dam structures and anything else that may threaten the health and safety of users of the public lands and BLM employees.  Compliance with environmental and safety and health laws is required including: Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), Clean Water Act (CAA), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), and the Federal Facilities Compliance Act (FFCA). The contractor's basic requirements will be assisting the BLM in the State of Idaho, and other BLM cooperators and or other Federal Agencies with technical assistance that may include examination of sites on BLM managed lands where physical hazards are known to exist or expected to exist and assessment, testing, analysis, design, correction, and documentation of actions at physical hazard sites. Many of the above actions are done internally by BLM or cooperators or both.  The contractor may or may not be asked for assistance on such actions or may be asked to complete an action without significant assistance from BLM.  It is the intent of Idaho BLM to have several contractors available to provide similar services.  At times, one or more contractors may be asked to do actions together. Actions to date in the State of Idaho have included: sealing of mine adits and shafts; placing gates on mine shafts, adits, and caves; removal of dangerous buildings; removal of dangerous river diversions; cleanup of non-hazardous dumps; removal of dangerous geologic hazards; posting warnings at known hazards areas; inventory of hazardous situations; and the documentation of actions. It is anticipated that an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract will be awarded and more than one award may be made. Location of work: Work is to be performed within the geographical boundary of Idaho.  There is often restricted site accessibility to many of the sites and will require special equipment to get to them.  There are often extreme weather conditions that vary from extreme cold in winter, to extreme heat in the summer time.  Travel is often hampered by poor weather conditions ie. fog, rain, snow.  There is often a limited window for sampling and excavation of sites due to frozen ground.    Lodging and dining facilities may be limited or non existent in many areas of the state.  These services may need to be provided by the contractor. Great distances may be encountered to towns or medical facilities.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a delivery order for the effort required to upgrade the Common Missile Acceptance Test Set (CMATS) Radio Frequency Interface Unit (RFIU).  The RFIU is currently used in conjunction with the CMATS-AS (Anti Ship) to provide acceptance testing of the Tomahawk Block II/III Range Safey System (RSS) and Recovery Exercise Modules (REM) in Tomahawk Missiles.  CMATS-AS has been identified as an obsolete test system which will become unsupportable in the year 2005.  In addition, a new CMATS-LA will be modified to interface with the upgraded RFIU to support testing of REM for 109A and 109C missiles as well as 109C and 109D RSS.   NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Systems Company (RSC), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Raytheon is the only company capable of performing this effort.  Since 1994, RSC has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for the Tomahawk All-Up-Round (AUR).  RSC solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tactical Tomahawk missile.  RSC currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapons System.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tactical Tomahawk missile is required to perform this effort, RSC is the only source capable of accomplishing these requirements in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

SECTION L – INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS OR RESPONDENTS

SECTION L is Attachment 2

SECTION M – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a)  This acquisition will utilize the Technically Acceptable-Performance/Price Tradeoff (TA-PPT) source selection procedure to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision.  The NAVAIDS need to be compatible in performance and data protocol with CLIN 0001 through 0007. A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror’s proposal will be made. Meeting the schedule requirements is one of main the determining factors for contact award. For those offerors who are determined to be technically acceptable, tradeoffs will be made between past performance and price.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the tradeoff process, by its nature, is subjective; therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the selection process.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as schedule, place of delivery, terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those included in paragraph (b)(1) below.

            
(b)   The TA-PPT evaluation process will be accomplished as follows:

     (1)  Technical.   Each offeror’s technical proposal will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach to meeting the government’s minimum requirements as described in the Schedule of Supplies.  Offeror’s proposals meeting the government’s minimum requirements will determined to be technically “acceptable”. The equipment needs to be standardized across the system for logistical, training, spare parts requirements and to enable it to be able to transmit data back to the ACC in Baghdad.  Installation of the NAVAIDs requires that these systems be compatible in performance and data protocol to the systems at Baghdad.
 
(2)  Performance.  For technically acceptable proposals, the past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offeror’s ability (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past work record.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet users’ needs including cost and schedule.  The currency and relevancy of the information, the source of the information, context of the data and general trends in the contractor’s performance will be considered.  The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) will be made.  The Government is not bound by the offeror’s opinion of relevancy.  The Government may consider an offeror’s contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offeror’s present and past performance lend itself to this approach.  For example, an offeror’s work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort.  However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort.  The following relevancy criteria apply:

•	VERY RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what this solicitation requires. 
•	RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. 
•	SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. 
•	NOT RELEVANT:  Did not involve any significant aspects of above.

In assessing present and past performance, the Government will employ several approaches, including, but not limited to:

(i).  Information utilized may be obtained from the references listed in the proposal, as well as from other sources known to the Government.  Data from previous source selections may be used if the data is recent and relevant.  Evaluation of present and past performance will include consideration of overall customer satisfaction and conclusions of informed judgment.  

	(ii).  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to  respond to the information.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  The confidence assessment will consider issues including, but not limited to, the number and severity of the problems, the appropriateness and/or effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised), and the offeror’s overall work record.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.

	(iii).  Past performance information will also be considered regarding any critical subcontractors and key personnel.  If an offeror, or the proposed key employees of the offeror, do not have a past performance history deemed relevant to this solicitation, the offeror will receive a neutral confidence rating.  The neutral confidence rating will be considered in the overall assessment for a best value decision.

	(iv) An overall confidence assessment rating will be made.  The following confidence assessment ratings apply:

Rating				Definition

Blue  			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
exceptional/high confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Green 		Based on the offerors record of performance there is very
good/significant confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Yellow		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
satisfactory/confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Grey			Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
neutral/unknown confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Black		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is
marginal/little confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Red			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
unsatisfactory/no confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

(3)  Price.  

 	    (a) IAW FAR Part 15.305 (a)(1) Cost or Price Evaluation, this competitive procurement will establish the basis for price reasonableness.
	
              (b) Total evaluated price, for award purposes, will be based upon the total price proposed
 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of Provision) 

Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items with its offer. The provision is attached.

The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items, as augmented by the Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) applies to this acquisition.

The US General Services Administration (GSA) is requesting information about a business intelligence solution to support an end-to-end solution for capturing data and providing world class information management reports regarding government travel while ensuring privacy act and security requirements are met.

An appropriate RFP process may follow if, and only if, both the eTravel Program Management Office (PMO) and the DTS PMO makes an acquisition decision to proceed.  Please refer to the attached RFI for additional information.

A non-mandatory information session will be held from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM EST, on February 28, 2005.  The location for this session is identified in the attached RFI.  If you plan to attend, you must contact GSA by sending an email to onthego@gsa.gov.  You will receive an acknowledgment of your registration.  Vendors are recommended to provide an advance list of questions so that responses can be prepared before the meeting, resulting in a more thorough exchange of information in the time allotted.

The POINT OF CONTACT for this effort is Lisa Maguire at onthego@gsa.gov.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:  Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Design/Build Multiple Award Construction Contract (DB-MACC) at the Naval Station, Great Lakes, Illinois and other activities within a 75-mile radius of Great Lakes, Illinois.  

This pre-solicitation notice is for information purposes only.  Solicitation documents will not be available for downloading until approximately March 15, 2005.  This solicitation is a 100% set-aside for 8(a) firms servicing the SBA Illinois District Office. The NAICS Code for work under this contract is 236220.   The solicitation will result in the award of one (1) IDIQ contract with a guaranteed minimum of $10,000.00 to the 8(a) contractor who provides the most advantageous, responsive and responsible technical proposal to the government.     

The work will include renovation, alteration, repair, construction and design/build capability by means of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) at the Naval Station, Great Lakes, Illinois and other military facilities within a 75-mile radius.  The preponderance of work in this contract will be maintenance and repair work, and occasional new construction with some design capability required.  The Government may choose to award the contract based on initial solicitation technical factors without holding discussions; the Government additionally reserves the right to reject any or all submittals at any time prior to award.  The contract contains a base period from contract award to September 30, 2006 and one (1) twelve-month option for a total maximum duration of thirty months for a maximum value of $10 million per year for all three indefinite quantity contractors.  The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about March 15, 2005.     

TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS:  All factors are of equal importance.  Sub-factors within each factor are of equal importance unless otherwise noted with the factor.  

Factor A: Past Performance and Relevant Project Experience
    Factor A1: Construction (given more weight than Design)
    Factor A2: Design
Factor B: Key Personnel
    Factor B1: Construction Team
    Factor B2: Design Team
Factor C: Management 
    Factor C1: Management Approach
    Factor C2: Quality Control
    Factor C3: Safety
    Factor C4: Bonding Capability
    Factor C5: Scheduling



FOLLOW-ON WORK AFTER AWARD:  The new IDIQ Contract awardee will be competing with the current MACC contractors, Far East/Rasch Construction and Pacific Construction Services, on subsequent task orders.  Task orders will range in size from $100,000 to $3,000,000.  Task orders placed on this contract may include 1) 100% design; 2) performance specifications; or 3) may require the contractor to do necessary design work.  Please note that a bid bond will be required for each task order proposal.  Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages.  Subsequent task orders may be awarded based on either best value trade-off or low price technically acceptable.  If the Government decides to issue a task order based on best value, award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements of that task order.  Should the newly awarded IDIQ contractor be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror.

<CONTACT>Elaine Flick Contracting Officer 3032363528     Elaine_Flick@blm.gov;
<DESC>The purpose of this announcement modification is to supercede the preceeding announcement and modification 0001 to reflect the correct description.  All dates and descriptions referred to in this announcement modification replace all others. DESCRIPTION: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is currently teaming with the USDA Forest Service (FS), for a combined requirement to replace and improve two separate and distinct agency Smokejumper (SMJ) parachute deployment systems, with a single common system for adoption by both agencies.  The BLM and FS Fire Management programs will utilize the new SMJ Parachute System to aerially deliver Smokejumpers to wildland fire incidents under the following conditions: parachuting into remote wild land areas and landing in open fields or meadows where a variety of surface features will be encountered (to include grass, brush or snow ground cover, hard, soft, wet, or dry surface conditions); parachuting into small or confined landing areas that are surrounded by trees; parachuting into sites with mission specific equipment attached to the parachute harness system; parachuting into mountainous areas that may include any of or a combination of the conditions previously referenced; with Smokejumper experience levels varying from 0 to 600 jumps.  The New SMJ Parachute System basic design shall be a non-developmental, commercially available product.  The New SMJ Parachute System must be flight proven.  Some design adjustments to the basic design will be acceptable to meet the requirements of the specification released with the Solicitation.  The New SMJ Parachute System shall include the required Main Canopy Sub-assembly, Reserve Canopy Sub-assembly, Pack/Harness Sub-assembly, Smokejumper model CYPRES Automatic Activation Device (to be provided as GFE) Sub-assembly, and components such as risers, bridles, deployment bags, pilot chutes, cushioning and hardware necessary for a fully operational and safe parachute ready for jumping in Static Line configuration (must be direct bag capable).  It shall meet requirements of the specification at the time of proposal submission, and shall retain this certification throughout deliveries, testing and its entire life.  The harness and container assembly must be compatible with a variety of appropriate main and reserve canopies.  Due to the need to integrate the requirements of two agencies, and multiple Smokejumper bases, the proposal and evaluation process will involve multiple phases.  All vendors who believe they meet the technical requirements of the solicitation estimated to be released on or about March 14 2005 will be invited to submit technical proposals on or around April 15, 2005.  Technical proposals will be evaluated based on criteria identified in the Solicitation and those vendors who make the competitive range will be invited to submit one (1) complete assembly and one (1) representative representing their firm to the Government for the Phase II Ground Evaluation.  Assemblies will be evaluated based on Ground Evaluation criteria identified in the Solicitation, and those vendors who make the competitive range will be invited to submit a price proposal and four (4) complete assemblies for the Phase III Jump Evaluation.   Assemblies will be evaluated based on Jump Evaluation criteria identified in the Solicitation and the vendor who is deemed to represent the best value to the government, considering technical, past performance, and price, will be awarded a contract for a minimum of 60 complete assemblies with options for 1,000 to 1,500 additional units or sub components to be purchased over four option years.  Options will be exercised contingent upon the results of a field evaluation that will occur in the 2006 Fire Season.  Due to the complexities of the proposal and evaluation process, a Pre-proposal conference will be held in Denver two weeks after the Solicitation has been posted, on or about March 29, 2005.  The approximate milestone schedule for this acquisition is as follows: (1) Solicitation released 3/15/05; (2) Pre-proposal conference in Denver 3/29/05; (3) Technical Proposal due date 4/15/05; (4) Phase I Technical Evaluation in Denver 4/18/05 to 4/21/05; (5) Phase II Ground Evaluation 5/26/05 to 6/22/05; (6) Phase III Jump Evaluation 9/26/05 to 10/14/05; (7) Contract Award 12/19/05; (8) Receipt of 60 complete assemblies 5/12/06; (9) Phase IV Field Test Summer 2006 Fire Season; (10) Option Exercise for up to 1,500 additional assemblies over four years 2007 through 2010.  The proposed contract is 100% set-aside for small business concerns under NAICS code 314999, with a size standard of 500 employees.  The requirement will be awarded on a firm-fixed price basis as an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity contract with a base year and four options.  Offerors will be requested to visit the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to download a copy of the solicitation.  A written copy of the solicitation will not be made available.  All offerors are reminded that in order to be eligible for contract award registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://www.ccr.gov/ is required.  Any questions about this requirement in advance of the solicitation release date, should be directed to Elaine E. Flick, Contracting Officer, at 303-236-3528 or elaine_flick@blm.gov.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University, the DOD Medical School, is amending the synopsis “Telephone Survey” Reference PMB5021 posted on 2/17/05, to include the following information.

The due date for all quotes is extended until 5:00 P.M. February 28, 2005.   All questions must be received by 5:00 P.M. February 22, 2005.  

Proposals shall be limited to ten pages and may be submitted by e-mail as Word or PDF file.  Proposals shall contain a brief description of similar projects completed by the offering firm with contact information for the scientific/medical researcher at the customer location.  This information will be used to assess corporate experience and past performance.  

Firms shall propose a lump-sum fixed-price for this project.  Payment will be made upon receipt and acceptance of the 500 completed surveys.  Currently, available funding is limited to $30,000-$35,000.  If, in the opinion of your firm, this is not a sufficient amount to complete this survey, please specify how to best spend available funds, which tasks will remain undone, and the additional amounts necessary to complete the survey. If available funds are more than necessary, a lower proposed price will be reflected in the evaluation scores.    

The sampling frame should be determined based on phone prefixes; target prefixes will be determined based on location within a low-income census tract.  The study inclusion criteria will include the following: age (over the age of 50) and race/ethnicity (self-identify as African-American or Black).  Although use of the Bureau of Primary Health Care clinics will be assessed, use of the clinics will not be part of the eligibility criteria for the study.  Firms shall describe their plans to develop a call list through a Random Digit Dial; a targeted list may also be used.  The market will be targeted to Maryland.  

The prevalence of colorectal cancer screening in African Americans is estimated to be 30%. The sample will be stratified based on adherence to colorectal screening. 300 individuals (150 women, 150 men) will be non-adherent to colorectal screening, meaning they have never had a colorectal screening test. 200 individuals (100 women, 100 men) will have had a colorectal screening test.   

The list of survey questions will be provided at the time of the award.  There are an estimated number of 50-60 questions on the survey.  The estimated time frame for this survey is 25-30 minutes, including the eligibility screening.  All of the questions will be close-ended; however, 5-10% of the questions will have “other” as a possible response, which the individual will need to specify.

This Procurement is 100% Set-Aside for small businesses only.  The NAICS code is 541910 with a size standard of $6,000,000.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 1 to SolicitationW914NS-05-Q-0009:

Question 1:  CLIN 0005 appears to be a duplicate of CLIN 0003. Is it a duplicate CLIN, or is the requirement to provide a qty of 2 DVORs. Answer: CLIN 0003 is a duplicate of CLIN 0005, delete CLIN 0003. There is only one (1) D-VOR/DME.
CLIN 0007 makes reference to connecting the radios to a consolidated terminal. Please provide further clarification as to the 'consolidated terminal.”ANSWER: Consolidated Terminal should be in a console within the ATC Tower. 

Question 2:  In the paragraph immediately following CLIN 0017, the solicitation notice states:
'Provide a proposal with a construction cost estimate for the Basra Airport in accordance with the Statement of work that is attachment 1.  The proposal shall include pricing for a complete system at Basra Airport. The cost proposal shall be in individual line item format.  Costs for all options should be included'. We interpret this to mean that the offeror is to provide a cost estimate for the civil works, which involves siting of the ATC equipment and installation of the items delivered under CLINS 0001-0009, 0011 and 0014 above. We also interpret this to be a request for a cost estimate separate to the pricing requested for CLINs 0001 through 0017, and that is should be a cost estimate as opposed to FFP. Please confirm that this is a correct interpretation. Also, which requirements should be considered as options? ANSWER:  This is not a CLIN but is a statement to indicate that the proposal shall be to supply a complete system. If Offeror has no options, then last line does not apply.  All pricing should be for a firm fixed price contract. 

Question 3: You have requested pricing for commercial products sold internationally, however the SOW requires deliverables above and beyond those that are normally provided commercially, such as drawings converted to metric measurements and produced in Arabic. Can documentation be provided in the English language only? Answer: Drawings in English with metric measurements are acceptable. The solicitation includes 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders/Commercial Items.  This clause invites the CO to incorporate certain clauses by reference, however no clauses are checked. Is it your intent to identify those clauses that are to be incorporated by reference? ANSWER: Yes, they will incorporated by reference in the contract.
Is clause 52.232-30, Installment Payments, likely to be applicable?  ANSWER: Installment or Advanced payments will not be authorized however, the Government will entertain Progress Payments.

Question 4:  CLIN 0014 refers to an “Air Traffic Control tower and/or Approach Control facility”.  CLIN 0007 refers to “limited Approach Control Support”.  There is no other reference to an Approach Control in the other documents.  Since the automation equipment requested in CLIN 0002 does not adequately support a full approach control functionality could you provide additional clarification as to the intent?  ANSWER:  CLIN 0014 Delete “and/or Approach Control Facility.” CLIN 0007 Change “ “limited Approach Control support” to read “limited Approach support”. Approach Radar at Basra is to function as a “stand alone” facility, but it should have the capability to expand-be linked to the Approach Control Facility at Baghdad as part of a nationwide system.

Question 5:  Reference CLIN 0007: Ground to air radio Communication Systems: "Approach Control (APP) be linked to a consolidated Terminal Approach Control (TRACON) located at Baghdad International Airport". Does this mean that just the radio channels (frequencies 121.5 and 243.0 MHz) are to be remoted back to the Baghdad ACC  (TRACON) via the existing VSAT network?  Is there a requirement to remote any of the other 9 radios back to the Baghdad TRACON? Is it valid to assume that a Voice Communications Control Switch (VCCS) is required to assign the radio frequencies to the vari

	REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.
	THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.


The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available products.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

The United States House of Representatives (USHR) is soliciting industry for technology solutions to enable digital signatures and intake capabilities as they relate to Member offices facilitating casework for constituents. The focus of this solicitation is to enable the constituent to provide the congressional office with basic intake information and to electronically “sign” the privacy release form. This solution would serve as the foundation for a comprehensive and scalable solution that would incorporate interactions with federal agency guidelines and systems and allow for the constituent to track casework status via a Web-based interface. USHR procured the services of the Congressional Management Foundation (CMF) to conduct a detailed study for electronic casework. 

The type of casework congressional offices handle runs the entire gamut of federal agency services.  In nearly every way that the federal government interacts with citizens, Members of Congress have intervened on behalf of their constituents.  A plurality of these cases relate to immigration services (even for Members whose districts do not contain large immigrant populations), but many cases also involve:  lost Social Security checks, disability claims, and requests for reassignment from military personnel.

Most constituents who request assistance of a congressional office do so because they feel they have exhausted their other options.  As a result, the constituents are often frustrated and/or desperate, and the requests are often time-sensitive.  The congressional Caseworker – or sometimes, the Member of Congress – is placed in the position of serving as advocate for the constituent with the agency or as ombudsman between the constituent and the agency.  The congressional Caseworker is simply inserting herself into an existing process, over which she has little control or authority beyond the imprimatur of the Member of Congress.  In fact, congressional casework isn’t “real” casework, since it is usually not the congressional office that solves the problem.  

The congressional office has complete discretion as to whether and how it pursues a request for assistance from a constituent.  For a variety of reasons, both political and altruistic, Members of Congress feel that casework is an essential responsibility for their office.  Depending upon how an office classifies a case, offices can receive between 500 and 1,500 cases each year.  Nearly all of this work is handled through the district offices using a combination of manual and computer processes that each office customizes based on a variety of factors, including:  priority of casework in the office; demands of constituents; and management structure of the office.  

Casework actually begins before a Member office ever becomes involved.  There is always a pre-existing relationship – sometimes a long-term pre-existing relationship – between the constituent and the agency with which he or she is having difficulty.  The Member usually becomes involved in that relationship because the constituent feels he has exhausted every other avenue he can identify for resolving the problem and finally turns to the Member’s office for assistance. Once constituents contact them to initiate a case, Member offices follow the same basic process for conducting casework:

1.	The constituent contacts the office via phone, postal mail, fax, or e-mail to request assistance.
2.	Information about the case is entered into the office’s correspondence management system (CMS) – the databases offices use to track all interaction with their constituents – and the case is assigned to a Caseworker.
3.	The Caseworker either provides the service to the constituent (where no agency involvement is necessary) or provides a privacy release form for the constituent to sign (where agency involvement is necessary).   Offices provide the privacy release form via postal mail, fax or a downloadable PDF file on the Member’s Web site.
4.	The constituent returns the signed privacy release form to the office via postal mail or fax.  The privacy release must be physically signed by the subject of the case, but it need not be notarized or witnessed.
5.	The Caseworker either contacts the agency to initiate the case or contacts the constituent to collect more information, including any case-related documents, and then initiates the case with the agency.
6.	The agency acknowledges receipt of the Member’s inquiry, usually by postal mail, and begins working on the case.
7.	The Caseworker monitors the status of the case, interacting with the agency and constituent, as necessary.
8.	The agency provides the service or information.  Response times vary widely, and many offices have cases that have been open for more than one year, though those cases do not represent a large proportion of the cases offices handle.
9.	The Caseworker notifies the constituent of the resolution via phone, fax, or postal mail. 
10.	The case is closed and the office retains records in electronic and paper formats.

The speed and ease with which cases are pursued are influenced by a variety of factors, but the following are critical for expediting congressional casework:

•	Getting privacy release forms signed and delivered promptly.  Caseworkers expressed frustration with the delays in initiating a case due to their inability to get privacy release forms signed and delivered promptly.  They noted that sometimes this is the fault of constituents, who procrastinate or lose interest in the process.  Other times the delay is the result of distance (as with deployed military personnel and citizens abroad) or confusion. In matters that are time sensitive, any delay hinders the initiation of the case.

•	Collecting relevant information and documents from the constituent.  Many cases are complex and require extensive documentation, and many agencies are adamant about the specific information and documents they need to initiate a case.  As a result, there are sometimes significant delays in the casework process because a constituent will fail to provide the congressional office relevant information and documents or because the Caseworker is not aware, at the beginning of the process, of the information and documents that are required by the agency.

•	Having access to up-to-date online information that addresses common casework issues and questions.  Caseworkers have noted that federal agency Web sites have been an unexpected asset in casework processing.  As agencies increase the amount and usability of their online case information, Caseworkers can sometimes process simple constituent inquiries or educate themselves on federal procedures using agency Web sites.  Information that once needed to be conveyed by an agency representative in a phone call or in writing can now be conveyed online, where it is convenient to all who need it.

•	Working with constituents who are knowledgeable and “professional.”  Although Caseworkers provide services to any constituent who comes to them needing assistance, some of the most expedient casework is performed as a result of the knowledge, commitment and professionalism of the constituent.  For example, Caseworkers noted that casework often goes most smoothly when it is performed for businesses, which often can devote experienced professionals or attorneys to expedite research and paperwork.  

•	Knowing which agency handles a case.  Knowledge of federal agencies and their sub-agencies is very helpful for Caseworkers when initiating cases.  New Caseworkers, especially those in freshman offices, often experience significant delays due to the need to educate themselves on the intricacies of the federal bureaucracy.

•	Knowing whom at an agency to contact.  Most agencies do not have central contact points for congressional casework.  Or, if they do, the central contact point will act as a conduit to another agency contact.  Congressional offices have reduced casework turn-around time by having experienced Caseworkers who have previously identified relevant agency contacts.

•	Developing personal relationships with agency personnel.  In focus groups CMF conducted for this project, Caseworkers noted that one of the most significant factors in quickly resolving a case was whether the Caseworker had a pre-existing relationship with agency personnel.  As district offices frequently deal with federal agency regional offices, Caseworkers often seek to identify local agency representatives who can assist in the casework process – eliminating the need for the Caseworker to move through the bureaucracy.

•	Receiving responses and progress updates from agencies.  In the focus groups and survey CMF conducted for this project, Caseworkers noted the benefit of receiving prompt acknowledgments of their inquiries and appreciated regular progress reports from agency personnel.  Unfortunately, they also noted that they often do not receive prompt acknowledgments and progress updates.

•	Having the ability to track the progress of an open case.  Caseworkers also indicated that knowing how a case is progressing with an agency and having a sense of the time until resolution was extremely important to their success.  In most cases, Caseworkers are dependent on agency personnel to provide them with periodic status reports or updates, which they do not always do.  For this reason, many Caseworkers noted their satisfaction with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service’s (USCIS) Case Status Service Online system (https://egov.immigration.gov/cris/jsps/index.jsp), which enables them (and their constituents) to track the status of their requests for assistance.  USCIS is the only federal agency providing this type of online tracking service at this time, but it seems to be a very helpful service for Caseworkers.

In the following we describe the specific technical requirements of an e-casework system as they relate to these procedural requirements.

1.	Preserve existing functional relationships among the participants in the process.  There are three distinct parties involved in the necessary transactions and communications that comprise the casework process:  the constituent, the congressional Caseworker, and the agency representative.  The congressional Caseworker is the conduit between the other two, except in rare cases where the agency representative contacts the constituent directly.  There is a need to preserve this “Caseworker as conduit” dynamic in the online world as well.  In order to do this, the system must:

•	Enable the constituent to initiate the contact at the Web site of his or her Representative;
•	Enable the Caseworker to respond to, and interact with, the constituent online or off line, as the Caseworker deems appropriate;
•	Enable the Caseworker to initiate the case and interact with the agency online or off line, as the Caseworker deems appropriate; and
•	Enable the Caseworker to preserve and transmit documents both online and off line.

Additionally, there is a need to ensure that the privacy release form is functionally similar to the current, paper-based form.  In other words, the form must be provided by the congressional office; signed by the constituent and returned to the Caseworker; stored by the Caseworker for future reference and use; and, if necessary, transmitted to agency personnel for reference and use.

2.	Integrate with existing workflow processes and software.  All but a few House Member offices rely on correspondence management systems (CMS) to manage their communications with constituents.  There are two vendors that, combined, provide CMS products to most House offices:  Lockheed Martin Information Technology (LMIT) and InterAmerica.  LMIT produces and supports Intranet Quorum (IQ) and InterAmerica produces and supports Capitol Correspond.  These are both basically client/server-based customer relationship management (CRM) products geared toward the specific needs of a congressional office, and offices are completely dependent upon them.  Any new e-casework system must be able to share data with these products, rather than requiring Caseworkers to operate two systems or to hand-enter data into their CMS databases.  This can be accomplished by using the existing House standard XML tags recognized by the CMS products, and will probably necessitate that new tags be created for additional casework-specific data fields.  Currently, IQ has the ability to read some casework-specific tags in addition to the House standard XML tags, and it enables additional tags to be incorporated through user-definable fields in the casework workflow system.  In the future, however, the House should consider applying standards that are both specific to casework and which look to agencies’ individual standards to make interoperability with agency systems easier.  There will also need to be several changes to the CMS software, including the issuance of digital credentials that may be stored locally or on a device or card carried by the staffer.

3.	Enable agencies to determine whether and how to integrate the system with their systems.  If XML tags are integrated into the e-casework system, those same tags can be developed and applied in ways that will enable agencies to integrate the electronic data sent by Caseworkers into their own databases or into those that are created based on agencies’ existing XML standards.  However, this would require agencies to develop capabilities and systems on their own to process the data.  Agencies must not be required to develop such capabilities to use the information sent by congressional offices.  The e-casework system must provide electronic information in such a way as to be accessible through standard e-mail or through customized solutions that may be developed by individual agencies.  To enable agencies to create the capabilities on their own, the House should issue documentation for the messaging standard.  If the House wanted to create a system without requiring a proprietary standard, it might be worth integrating a SOAP or Web services capability to “package” the information in a format that can be accepted by a range of systems, even if those systems have not integrated proprietary XML tags.

4.	Apply information standards, when practicable.  To make information sharing as smooth and user-friendly as possible for all parties, the e-casework system must apply relevant information standards whenever possible.  Some of the standards that must be considered include:

•	Messages should be in formats that are generally accepted. 
•	Digital credentialing should be in commonly used and issued formats. 
•	Digital documents, especially forms and transactions, should be captured and preserved using accepted standards (leaning toward XML standards as considered or adopted by the World Wide Web Consortium, OPEN/OASIS and other reputable standards organizations).
•	Online information should be accessible via standard Web browsers (with digital certificate capabilities) and Internet connectivity.  Any additional functionality (e.g. form viewer plug-ins) must be at no cost to the user, transparent to the user, and easy for a novice user to obtain.
•	Online information should conform to the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 in order to be accessible to citizens with disabilities.
•	User interfaces – for constituents, Caseworkers, and agency personnel – should apply common usability practices so they can be quickly and easily understood and used by any novice user (including using obvious terminology and analogies to current, paper-based processes).

5.	Protect identities and information.  There are inherent security risks in moving any business process to a networked environment, and they must be carefully managed in any e-casework system.  Security has not been an issue in the current, paper-based system, but moving casework online necessitates that security be built in from the beginning, especially in light of concerns about the relative ease with which privacy violations and identity and data theft can occur in an insecure online environment.  Also, because the process involves both bureaucratic and political considerations, it will be especially important to protect identities and information so that the system does not compromise agencies’ legal and statutory privacy requirements or congressional offices’ political reputations or relationships with their constituents.  Requirements the e-casework system will have for providing protection include ensuring that:

•	The system is configured to route data directly, and without fail, to the appropriate congressional office.
•	The system is configured to allow data to pass through a central server without residing on it, so that constituent information is only captured and preserved by the appropriate office.
•	All personal data that is transmitted over the Internet is encrypted.
•	Individual offices’ databases are insulated from unauthorized entry through the e-casework system.
•	The system conforms to agencies’ Privacy Act requirements for responding to congressional inquiries.
•	The Caseworker has clear, user-friendly, and transparent control over what information is shared with constituents and with agency personnel.

6.	Ensure that online transactions occur in a secure environment.  The very act of enabling casework transactions to occur electronically will fundamentally change those transactions by making them easier and more open.  That ease and openness must not come with a security risk.  Any transaction that occurs over a network must be secure so that the data is not compromised en route and can be trusted by the receiver of the information.  Constituents must be able to trust that the information they send will be accessed and viewed only by the congressional office and the agency.  Caseworkers must be able to trust that they control the information and who may access and view it.  Agencies must be able to trust that the information was sent by a congressional office and that future electronic communications will be received by the appropriate office.  In this type of system, which often involves sensitive personal information about constituents, it will also be very important that the security throughout the system be transparent.  Each user interface should make it explicit and obvious how the data will be protected.

7.	Ensure that the requirements of the Privacy Act, as they relate to congressional offices, are met.  The disclosure of personal information about citizens by federal agencies is governed by the Privacy Act of 1974, which is why many of them require constituents to sign a privacy release before they will share case information with congressional offices.  Although the Privacy Act does not apply to Congress, any system created by the House should take into account agencies’ requirements under the Privacy Act.  Most agencies have included congressional offices in their “routine use” exemption to the Privacy Act, which is what enables them to share case data with nothing more than a signed privacy release form.  However, agencies may, in an electronic environment, opt to require additional security and authentication measures before sharing case information with congressional offices.  Congress is not, and cannot become, an authenticating authority on behalf of agencies, but agencies may, in the future, require congressional offices to collect information, data, or files that will enable them to authenticate constituents’ identities.  For this reason, the system will need to be flexible enough to accommodate changing agency requirements over time.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS. – 

The United States Marine Corps has a requirement to meet the mobility/counter-mobility requirement identified in Urgent Universal Need Statement CDTS # 04320UG for a Multi-Purpose Blade Assembly.  The Multi-Purpose Blade Assembly will be semi-permanently attached to the M1A1 Main Battle Tank, and will provide for hasty removal of roadblocks (rubble, automobiles, and other emplaced obstacles), hasty crossing of ditches, pipelines, rapid digging of defensive positions, and other miscellaneous tasks to enhance the mobility of the mechanized force on the battlefield.   The system will be used as a rapidly employable, organic asset of the Tank Battalion, capable of easy, rapid attachment/detachment from the M1A1 Tank.
 
The USMC is interested in obtaining a source that can adapt an already existing Blade Assembly to the M1A1 Tank, without interfering with the lethality, mobility, or capability to attach other special missions kits, such as the Track Width Mine Plow.  A fully functional M1A1 Tank, with other agreed upon Government Furnished Equipment would be provided to support this evaluation.  In addition, the existing Blade Assembly must be fully developed and in use by at least one Defense Force.   It is important to note to any prospective vendor that the USMC is not interested in any development of the assembly itself or associated control assemblies, wiring harnesses, motors, hydraulic cylinders and associated support and test equipment.   Our interest extends only to refinement of existing mounting mechanisms/hardware that will allow a fully developed blade assembly to be rapidly attached/detached from the M1A1 Tank.  Additionally, the assembly, when attached and employed, cannot interfere with lethality or mobility capabilities of the M1A1 Tank.

All vendors having the capability of meeting these requirements are requested to submit copies of relevant documentation in response to this Request for Information at no cost to the Government.  Written responses should be submitted not later than close of business 9 March 2004.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS
The US Air Force, Hill Air Force Base, is seeking potential interested sources for a production requirement to manufacture the Global Positioning System (GPS) Full Signal Translator (FST) in support of the Minuteman ICBM Weapon System.  The government requirement is for three (3) First Article FST units and 27 FST Production units.  The First Article units would be delivered 24 months after award and the Production units 24 months after First Article approval.

The FST was developed by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) Laurel, Maryland, and all technical and proprietary processes are maintained and owned by JHU/APL.  The FST was developed as a small, lightweight, low-power, full bandwidth, analog, low-cost translator that could be used in very confined spaces, including reentry vehicles and ballistic missile interceptors, to provide a means to utilize all of the GPS signals available for more precise post flight trajectory reconstruction.   The FST technical data package is maintained under configuration control as level 2 development documentation by JHU/APL.  The government does not have complete configuration drawings or data.

Interested sources would be required to contract with JHU/APL under their Technology Transfer Program and execute “a non-exclusive licensing agreement” providing the licensee rights to the FST technology with all licensing fees borne by the interested party.  Licensing costs associated with production of the FST for Air Force production may be a direct charge to the program; however, those costs for use by other government agencies and commercial customers are not allowed.  Training programs with JHU/APL to transfer the technology will not be a direct charge to this program.

Interested sources are required to provide the following information:  (1) Name, address, telephone number, point of contact, and location of manufacturing facility that would perform this program; (2) A description of corporate experience developing and manufacturing electronic components and instruments used on missiles, spacecraft, satellites and/or supersonic aircraft.  Specific experience developing and/or manufacturing GPS receivers and/or translators should be highlighted; (3) Identify potential issues you envision with the FST Technology Transfer/licensing program with JHU/APL; (4) Explain what required training/experience you currently have, what additional training you will require, and how you will obtained it; (5)  How will you meet the delivery schedule and do you foresee problems meeting the schedule; (6) provide any other recommendations/suggestions that should be considered in meeting the government’s requirements.

Interested sources should respond in writing and may provide a response via e-mail to Jack.Albretsen@hill.af.mil or mail to Hill Air Force Base, Directorate of Contracting and Manufacturing, ATTN: Jack V. Albretsen/LMKA/Bldg 1258, 6014 Dogwood Avenue, Hill Air Force Base, UT 84056.  Questions may be directed to Jack Albretsen at (801) 777-5793.  All responses should be submitted no later than 4 March 2005.

Specific requirements and exceptions are provided below.

In addition to performing operational services for DOS personnel throughout the day on an as-scheduled/requested basis, Company personnel will provide:
	-pick up and drop off services of non-Company provided equipment owned or leased by the DOS (for example, pick up of a government vehicle from a leasing company or delivery of a government vehicle to a maintenance facility),
	-dedicated full-time courier services (driver and vehicle) to two offices.  While one of these offices requires service primarily during normal business hours, the other requires service approximately 80-100 hours per week.

Shuttle service in the DC Metro area consists of eight specific routes, two of which are supported by large 44-passenger buses, with the remaining routes supported by 36-passenger or smaller buses/vans.  Scheduled services run primarily between the Main DOS building located at 21st & C Streets, NW DC and multiple stops in Rosslyn and Arlington, Virginia.  Some routes require a single 15-passenger van, while others require simultaneously running 15-passenger vans, or 24-, 36- or 44-passenger buses.

Unscheduled group bus/van services are required for groups of 15-100 people in the DC Metro area year-round, with some weekend and holiday trips required.

VIP transport services are provided by executive sedan on a scheduled basis and in accordance with DOS-established priorities.  Pick up and drop off points are generally within the DC area, including National and Dulles Airports, and outlying rural, residential areas. 

In the event of emergent requirements that mandate implementation of evacuation procedures, the Company may be directed to pull vehicles off of established shuttle routes, and to re-direct those vehicles to the evacuation effort; in theses instances the Company will receive directions from the DOS Fleet Manager, his designee or higher authority, and will continue to work unabated as directed until notified by the Fleet Manager to cease emergency operations and resume normal operations.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health is conducting this market survey to identify small businesses with the capability to serve as a large-scale genotyping center to provide sample receipt and handling, high-throughput genotyping, integration and documentation of phenotypic data, database and website development, bioinformatics, data management, data distribution, and administration. The overall objective of the NHLBI Large-Scale Genotyping Center is to expand the utilization of NHLBI=s well-phenotyped observational cohorts and intervention studies for genetic association studies, through the application of large-scale genotyping and widespread data dissemination for genotype-phenotype correlation. The Genotyping Center will process data set requests from scientific investigators for purposes of data analysis. The NHLBI Large-Scale Genotyping Center will perform in-depth characterization of more than 1,700 candidate genes (8-10 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) per gene region) on approximately 50,000 study members in heart, lung, blood and sleep (HLBS) studies, for a total of more than 850 million genotypes (at a maximum cost, including labor, of $0.01 per genotype at initiation; costs are expected to lower as technologies evolve).  The Genotyping Center must have the capacity to generate at least 850 million genotypes over two years with an error rate of no more than 1%. The NHLBI Large-Scale Genotyping Center will also develop informatic management processes for curation and cross-study data comparison, and provide a computing platform that facilitates data portability, accessibility, and security. The Genotyping Center must keep abreast of the evolving National Electronics Clinical Trials and Research (NECTAR) network as envisioned in the NIH Roadmap (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/clinicalresearch/overview-networks.asp), as well as the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG, http://cabig.nci.nih.gov/) and the e-health record of the HHS National Health Information Infrastructure (http://aspe.hhs.gov/sp/nhii/) as the computing platform and data set developed for dissemination must be capable of integration and interoperability with these platforms.  The Genotyping Center will also establish comparable, resource-wide standardized phenotypes, controlled vocabularies including metathesaurus, thesaurus, and defined data elements mapped across participating population studies, and prepare uniform protocol models facilitating post-collection coordination and the evaluation of comparability across data sources.  The Genotyping Center will process requests for use of the data generated including: processing applications, ensuring up-to-date IRB approval and completion of data distribution agreements from requesting investigators, creating data sets, distributing data sets to investigators, and providing technical support (answering questions about data).  The Center will also develop and implement plans for distribution of non-identifying summary data, such as allele frequencies, in public databases such as dbSNP.  The Large-Scale Genotyping Center will evaluate the feasibility of a genome-wide association study based on the current state-of-the-art and outputs of studies such as the Design and Analysis for Genome-wide Association Studies RFA, particularly regarding analytic strategies and marker selection.  If feasible, the Genotyping Center will perform a genome-wide association study involving the use of a standard set of up to 300,000 state-of-the-art genetic variants in roughly 500 cases and 1,000 controls, for a total of roughly 450 million genotypes (at a maximum cost of $0.01 per genotype, including labor costs). Other required outputs of the Genotyping Center are monthly reports on quality control, status of genotyping and data integration, and reports on data dissemination.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710 and the size standard is 500 employees.  It is anticipated that one award will be made for a period of 4 years. The contract will be a cost-reimbursement, completion-type. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) AND NO RFP IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. Small businesses who believe that they possess the capabilities to perform this work must submit an original and three copies of a capability statement to this office by 4:00 PM EST on March 7, 2005.

<DESC>The Point of Contact for this RFI is Ms. Mary OHaver @ 210-295-3213. This Request for Information (RFI) issued by the US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) is to solicit information from potential sources of industry on the solicitation approach that will assist the United States Army Medical Information T echnology Center (USAMITC) in formulating a best value approach for purchasing and installing a Video Multi-Conferencing Units (MCUs)solution, replacing the existing MCUs in the network.  This is not a request for proposals.  Information obtained as a resu lt of this posting may be used in the development of the Statement of Work for the solicitation. It is the Government's intent to use the gathered information initially for cost, schedule, and feasibility planning and potentially for the basis of a future contract/delivery order. The intent of this RFI is to determine a replacement MCU solution that w ill allow USAMITC to support advanced video conferencing without loss of functionality or compatibility with existing customers.   The USAMITC is looking for a bridging and scheduling solution that will integrate seamlessly into their existing operation that will allow for scalability, forwards and backwards, and that will fulfill their future needs. Any solution must include ISDN and  IP capability, and the flexibility to work between the two. Integration into a Collaborative environment is a key attribute. The USAMITC currently operates on three Avaya MCUs and one Accord MGC MCU, two of the Avayas located in San Antonio, one in Fredrick, MD, and the MGC in Falls Church, VA. Avaya systems are scheduled via CRCS and the MGC is scheduled using proprietary sof tware. All are controlled via LAN connections. Any solution must include remote access capability to allow operation from multiple locations via serial, LAN, Internet, VLAN, Telnet and future control systems.  The new solution and its associated controllin g systems must integrate with the existing private ISDN network which is a combination of net.com Promina nodes connected to Madge/Teleos IMUXs, as well as IP and public ISDN networks. The solution we are seeking will encompass hardware and software that will allow us to interface with our existing and future network solutions and provide for scheduling from a central location (via both LAN/WAN and internet) of more than 1800 rooms/sites  as well as provide reporting and metric capability for monitoring performance. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of thi s RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and the Government's use of such information. Respondent s of this RFI may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their initial submittals. For a detailed technical list or for questions concerning this RFI, send an email to vtc.usamitc@amedd.army.mil and have MCURFI in the subject line.

<SUBJECT>R -- Implementing Cost-Effectiveness for SPNS Initiative
<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is conducting a Sources Sought/Market Survey to locate Small Business, Veteran Owned, HUBZone and 8(a) Firms under NACIS Code 541990 ($6 M) capable of developing and implementing a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) evaluation of three current SPNS initiatives and its service.   The SPNS Program is considered the research and development arm of the Ryan White CARE Act. SPNS assesses the effectiveness of innovative models of HIV care, supports the development of these models, and promotes the replication of effective models of care.  The SPNS Program provides an opportunity to the HIV care community to develop innovative services by providing funding and expertise for grantees to evaluate innovations and disseminate findings to the HIV community. Today, a portfolio of 74 grants, funded either solely by the HIV/AIDS Bureau or in partnership with other Federal agencies address tomorrow’s issues in HIV care.  SPNS grantees are funded among different type of HIV care settings.  Approximately twenty-nine percent (29%) of SPNS grantees belong to university clinics, 26% to Community Clinics, 17% are Evaluation and Technical Assistance Centers, 15% belong to local or State Health Departments, 7% are Community Based Organizations, and 6% are from private or Non-Profit Organizations. SPSN grantees serve a variety of different sub-populations including communities of color and underserved highly in need of HIV care services. Our current priorities include: Supporting the coordination and integration of existing services for Native Americans/Alaska Natives living with HIV and other co-morbidities, Developing models of community-based health care networks that effectively reduce barriers to early identification of HIV disease and assure entry to high quality primary health care for individuals who live and/or work in the U.S. region of the U.S./Mexico border area, Evaluating the effectiveness of integrating Buprenorphine opioid abuse treatment into HIV primary care settings; Assessing interventions targeting HIV-positive individuals in clinical care, to prevent transmission to uninfected individuals and to prevent re-infection among people who are already infected with the virus; Identifying and evaluating effective models of outreach to underserved HIV positive people not in care; improving care and treatment of HIV+ persons of Caribbean descent by evaluating community-based peer programs that are serving people living with HIV who are underserved and of Caribbean origin; Assessing the extent to which IT, applied in various HIV care settings, can contribute to measurable and sustainable improvements in the delivery, quality and cost-effectiveness of care for people living with HIV (PLWH), especially among communities of color and underserved populations; Supporting the development and evaluation of innovative service models designed to reach HIV-infected young MSM not engaged in clinical care and to link them to appropriate clinical, supportive, and preventive services; Improving the quality of HIV care and Collaborating with CDC on interventions for HIV-positive substance abuse users and continuity of care for incarcerated individuals.  A prospective award will be developed and implemented for a cost-effectiveness analysis evaluation of three current SPNS initiatives.  The first is the Outreach and Intervention initiative, begun in 2001, as a two-phased five-year program of ten projects refining and evaluating current outreach strategies for bringing HIV-positive individuals into comprehensive continual care.  The second initiative is Outreach, Care and Prevention Initiative to Engage HIV Seropositive Young MSM (Men who have sex with men) of Color, which began in 2004.This is a five-year program to develop and evaluate service models among eight grantees designed to reach HIV-infected young MSM not engaged in clinical care and to link them to appropriate clinical, supportive, and preventive services.  The third initiative is Models of Peer Support for Caribbean’s living in the United States.

HSAR3052.209-70 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES         [DEC 2003] 
 
(a) Prohibitions. 
    
Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur.
 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    	Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    	Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    		(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    			(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
    			(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    		(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    		(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
(d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

    		(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 

    			(i) Warrants; 

    			(ii) Options; 

    			(iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 

    			(iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
     
     			(v) Others similar interests. 
    
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland
Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent? for at least 80 percent each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1)           The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section. (d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) Warrants; (ii) Options; (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; (iv) Convertible debt instruments; (v) Others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. (End of provision)

Questions and Answers

Solicitation:  02-NIDAIRP-2005 
Title: Customized Leadership Training

1.	Anticipated number of training iterations each year ?one
2.	Anticipated number of attendees per course?Total = 25-30
3.	Will the courses ALL be contained in the Washington DC / Baltimore corridor, or nationally?
The course will be held entirely in Rockville or Baltimore, MD
4.	Is there a vendor currently providing this type of work for NIDA now?  If yes, what is the name of the contractor and are they eligible to bid on this one, too?
no

5.	How often will class be held?
One time

6.	What are the class sizes, highest number vs. lowest number? 
The pilot program will be offered to 7 people.  The program roll out will be based on the pilot program and will be offered to an additional 20 people

7.	Will delivery equipment be furnished ie. Chalk board etc?
   Yes unless specialty equipment is required

8.	Will there be a need for special equipment for impaired students?
Probably not

9.	Will you please let me know if this is a new opportunity?  If not, will you provide the name of the incumbent?  This is a new opportunity
 


10.	Anticipated/estimated # of classes
1 two-day pilot program and 1 two-day roll out program, follow-up one-hour individual phone coaching sessions may be added

11.	Anticipated length of contract
1 year

16.	One of my questions is about the format.  Is there a particular format for submitting this?  What is that format?  Also, is it acceptable to email the quote?  

No particular format.  All quotes must be submitted via U.S. Postal Service, Hand Delivery or Delivery Service

The Solicitation mentions MBTI, but I use a different instrument, DiSC Indra by Inscape Publishing.  (In my unbiased opinion it is superior to MBTI.)  Is that acceptable, or do you absolutely have to have MBTI?
No

17.	Is there a separate solicitation document for this procurement?
No
 
18.	Is there a separate scope of work?
No
 
19.	Can we substitute a more robust instrument for the MBTI and FIRO-B in designing and training the NIDA senior management?  If yes, we will submit a proposal.
No
 
20.	Can you please tell me what the parameters are for '100% small business set aside'.  I need to know if we qualify.
Contact the Small Business Administration


21.	How many interviews will be allowed for the development of the competency models?
Probably 7 or 8

22.	Do you use the OPM leadership competency models?
No

23.	For the three topics that you have requested training (Effective Communications, Conflict Management, Motivation & Coaching for Subordinates), how many hours do you expect each class to be?
We are aiming for a course that encompasses all topics and will go for two full days.  The distribution of hours for each category of training is dependent upon the specialized needs of the organization (NIDA).  It is incumbent upon the contractor to design a training program that meets NIDAs scope of work.

24.	Are you currently using assessment instruments on your senior management team? If yes, please advise which ones?
No.  A survey on customer satisfaction was done a number of years ago.  

26.	Main differences between old statement of work and the current one?
First synopsis/solicitation did not contain statement of work

27.	Other question and answers from other contractors/persons All questions submitted by the February 4, 2005 deadline are posted in this notice


28.	I assume you are looking for a firm fixed price quote? If not, please let me knowFirm-Fixed Price


29.	It appears that the exact number of required classroom training days cannot be determined before the NIDA specific Leadership Competency Model has been developed and agreed to.  If that is the case, how would you advice I price the training portion of this proposal without knowing the exact number of training days that will be required?  I want to offer a competitively priced proposal.  If I am over estimate the time required, my price may not be competitive with another proposal that underestimates the time required.  Will you instead accept an 'estimated' number of training days and judge the proposal on a 'per-day' fee basis?
30.	‘per-day’ fee is acceptable, bearing in mind that a two-day model is preferred.  The training shall not exceed two days.  This is the maximum time allowed for this training for senior management.  

31.	My training firm owns a proprietary 360 degree feedback instrument.  We offer a 'standard' 70 question 360 feedback instrument which has proved quite useful for the majority of our clients.  However, we can also tailor the instrument to specifically model the NIDA Leadership Competency Model, including an entirely new set of instrument questions.  Tailoring the 360 to NIDA specific language makes the instrument more expensive.  Can I offer two prices for the 360 feedback reports for 27 NIDA managers, one price for the 'standard' instrument and one price for the NIDA specific instrument? 
32.	Pricing can be developed both ways.  However, we want a NIDA specific tool to be used for evaluative purposes.  We also want MBTI, FIRO-B, and the 360 degree feedback psychological assessment tools to be used.

33.	Has the NIH-NIDA offered a similar customized curriculum for NIDA senior management/executives on Leadership Development within the last 3 years? No
34.	If yes, what vendor(s) provided the services?

35.	What is the timeline for the deliverables in this solicitation? On or before April 1 , 2005
36.	Can you expand on the qualifications and experience that you will require of the selected vendor/consultants for this contract?
37.	The contractor must demonstrate extensive competency and skill in providing leadership development training.  This can be accomplished by documenting both public and private sector experience in this area as well as consultant academic training in this field of expertise.  The primary consultant must hold Ph.D. in organizational psychology.  The primary recipients of the NIDA leadership training are physicians and research scientists.  The Ph.D. credential makes the trainer more creditable to a scientific audience.  As a research organization all of the NIDA staff participating in this training are research scientists.      

38.	Solicitation Item # 3 states: “ Once the Competency Model has been approved the vendor will design training that will help select group (7) to become effective leaders. “ Are there 7 distinct groups of leaders? If not, please clarify the meaning of 7. 
39.	7 is the number of participants in the pilot program.  Each person is a senior management official at NIDA.  Each person is considered a group leader for his/her area of expertise (i.e. division or branch/section chief – IRP only).

40.	Is it your intention to have the vendor recommend the number and length of trainings? Or is there a set-amount of time for these trainings to be scheduled over the next year? 
41.	Our intention is to limit this offering to a 1 two-day pilot program (7 participants) followed by a separate  two-day roll out program (20 participants). Follow-up one-hour individual phone coaching sessions as needed can be priced per our per participant. 


42.	Do you expect to use an online 360 degree feedback instrument? Or would you prefer paper based? Online or hard copy is acceptable.


43.	Do you want a separate technical and price proposal? No

44.	The solicitation states: “…the vendor must furnish as part of their quote all descriptive material necessary for purchasing activity to determine whether the products meet all salient characteristics of this requirement.”  Would you please clarify in detail this statement? In addition to the quotation, all vendors must provide detailed information how the company can best meet the Government’s requirement

45.	Do you have a specific methodology in mind that you want the vendor to use in developing the competency model? If yes, what is the methodology? NIDA does not have a leadership competency model.  One of the goals to be achieved through this procurement is the development of a customized competency model that will be consistent with the current organizational leadership style and values.  The competency model will be designed based on current management practices that have been determined to be effective in both the public and private sectors.   

46.	We would like to use new technology instead of the MBTI and FIRO-B.  Can we substitute the Xyting Insight assessment?  NO

47.	 Do you want us to follow all the requirements in the original solicitation plus the ones in the Amendment, or do you want us only to follow those in the Amendment (FAR 12.6 and FAR 13)?  FAR 13 only 

48.	What are the business objectives that NIDA seeks to accomplish through the RFP? to develop a pilot training program in leadership development for 7 senior nida managers.  to teach these staff members how to more effective managers and leaders in a diverse knowledge based organization.
