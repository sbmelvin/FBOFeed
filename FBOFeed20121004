This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307."</span></p>

<DESC>This market survey announcement is issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy at 3.2.1.2.1. 	 This is a market survey.  This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposal (RFP). The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey and/or meetings.  Any cost associated with market survey submittals and meetings is solely at the interested vendor's expense. 
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined for the Future Flight Services Program (FFSP).  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
I. INTRODUCTION
This market survey is the second announcement regarding the FFSP. This market reseach is a continuation of the information gathering process initiated under Market Survey 11279, which was posted on the FAA's Contract Opportunities website on 10 November 2011. 
The FFSP Program Office is looking to conduct communications with industry for assistance in identifying any vendors possessing special knowledge and unique capabilities. 
These communications and/or meetings are being conducted prior to the formal start of the acquisition process and will not be subject to any evaluation.  This is not a down select of any kind and non-participation will not disqualify vendors from subsequent consideration. 
Information gathered during the previous market survey and theses communications and/or meetings may be used in the development of the acquisition and the future draft Statement of Objectives (SOO). Information provided may also be used to assist the FAA in determining the eventual composition of the infrastructure under which flight services may be provided.  
Any proprietary or confidential information provided during communications and/or meetings should be appropriately marked and identified. Information not identified as proprietary could potentially incorporate in the FFSP requirements.
II. PURPOSE
The purpose of this market survey is to offer interested vendors and industry groups the opportunity to participate in communications with representatives from the FFSP Program Office regarding innovative methods and approaches to provide future flight services, which encompasses a portfolio consisting of Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS), Operational and Supportability Implementation System (OASIS) and Direct User Access Terminal Service (DUATS).  FFSP will be a service-based program; therefore, the FAA is not interested in pursuing a system-based solution.
III. NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE
The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541330, Engineering Services. 
IV. TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION
Current and anticipated Federal budget constraints demand that the FAA continually evolve more cost effective methodologies of providing Flight Services to the General Aviation Community and other existing or potential Flight Service users while maintaining or enhancing the level of safety that can be derived through utilization of those services.  
The FAA envisions that FFSP will not be specialist-centric. Rather, the FAA anticipates that FFSP will provide easier access and enhanced functionality for pilots. Flight services will be automated to a greater extent, allowing both pilots and specialists to access the same data/information. 
The table provided in "Attachment A: Current and Potential Delivery of Flight Services" compares the delivery of flight services today with that anticipated for flight service improvements. 	 Interested vendors should be prepared to discuss the following topics during the communications and/or meetings: 
1.	Commercial and industry best practices that can be utilized to enhance providing flight services. 
2.	Innovative methods that the FAA and Industry might utilize to provide flight services. This includes, but is not limited to: 
	Restructuring, reducing, modifying, and/or enhancing flight services while considering effects on safety.
	Easier access and enhanced automated functionality to provide flight service for pilots while considering effects on safety.
	Government Furnished Information (GFI), Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and/or Government Furnished Property (GFP) that potential industry partners may find beneficial in providing more cost effective safety enhanced flight services (Wx Products, Traffic Flow Data, etc.) and reduced transition risk.
	Potential to leverage 'Cloud' computing (IaaS, SaaS, PaaS) in a new flight services model (Storage / new applications).
NOTE: Although areas of interest are identified above, respondents are not restricted or required to address these areas and should not consider the areas as constraints in the response.
3.	Transition requirements concerns.
4.	Potential integration of NextGen Programs into flight services.  
5.	Alternative acquisition approaches to provide flight services that could provide continuous improvements in terms of efficiency at a reduced cost to the FAA while still considering safety. 
6.	Opportunities to encourage and increase small business participation in the delivery of flight services.
V. FFSP DOCUMENTS PREVIOUSLY POSTED
Previously released FFSP documents have been posted on the FAA Contract Opportunities web site, at www.faa.gov/faaco under Market Survey Announcement #11279 dated 10 November 2011.
Although previous market survey documents include certain considerations and assumptions for FFSP, the FAA is open to all ideas for discussion.  For the purposes of these communications and/or meetings, respondents are not restricted to the information contained in the previous FFSP market survey documentation.
VI. SCHEDULING ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS
A website has been established for the purpose of scheduling one-on-one meetings industry representatives. Those planning to participate must register via the web site.  The web site address is: 
http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/systemops/ffs/
Upon receipt of registration, interested parties will be contacted by the FFSP Program Office to schedule meetings.	
One-on-one meetings are not mandatory.  Written submittals will also be accepted from any interested party wishing to submit information or comments. Vendors interested in providing written submittals should follow the above registration process and check the box for written submittals. The FFSP Program Office will contact these vendors upon receipt of registration to provide further instruction.
For vendors interested in providing a written response, responses must be provided in a common electronic readable format (Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF), in Times New Roman 12 pt. font.  Company background shall be limited to one page. There is no limit on page responses.  
Questions regarding the scheduling process should be directed to Jane Christoff via email at jane.christoff@faa.gov.
VII. CONDUCT OF ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS
Meetings are open to all interested vendors and industry groups regardless of whether a response was provided to the previous Market Survey 11279.  
It is anticipated that meetings will be conducted within a 90 minute timeframe. If additional time is needed, interested vendors should provide notification on the registration. Up to five (5) representatives from each vendor may participate in the one-on-one meetings with the FFSP Team.  
At a minimum, vendors should provide a brief presentation, 30 minutes or less, to include the five (5) questions identified in Section IV of this market survey. 
Respondents should note that the Government may elect to electronically record and/or document each one-on-one meeting to ensure an accurate record of the meetings.

<RESPDATE>101112
<ARCHDATE>10262012
<CONTACT>Nicole Saiauskie, 609-485-4781

<a href="mailto:nicole.saiauskie@faa.gov">nicole.saiauskie@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>Purpose of this Announcement: In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected source via single source procedures. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) proposes to award single source contract to Pratt & Whitney.
Background: Many commercial aircrafts have unexpectedly encountered volcanic ask in flight in the past years.  Some of these encounters caused in-flight loss of engine power, which could cause a crash of the airplane.  A range of damage may occur to airplanes that fly through an eruption cloud depending on the concentration of volcanic ash in the cloud, and the length of time the aircraft actually spends in the cloud.
NASA is working with the FAA and the USAF to conduct ground engine tests using a F117 engine installed on a USAF C17-A aircraft scheduled around March 2013.  Installed ground engine testing on USAF C17-A airplane provides a unique opportunity to utilize advanced instrumentation and sensor capability along with simulating a range of environmental conditions such as volcanic ash, while capturing system-level response on both the engine and aircraft level.  A key element of this test is to provide a means for engine ingestion of volcanic ash which requires engine modifications allowing for advanced sensor installation to provide critical experimental data during the testing.
The procurement will be to modify a F117 Pratt & Whitney engine to support the FAA/NASA/Air Force Volcanic Ash research project.   Pratt & Whitney is the original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) and own all proprietary rights to the design of the F117/PW2037 engine.
A full and open competition is not available for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with the single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capabilities and experience in providing the below services, the FAA will evaluate this accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Nicole Saiauskie, Nicole.Saiauskie@faa.gov, no later than 12pm (noon) EST on October 11, 2012.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.
Note: This procurement is subject to the AMS Clause 3.3.1-10, Subject to the Availability of Funds.

SCOPE OF WORK
CLEAN STORM-WATER STRUCTURES

Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment, transportation, supervision and disposal necessary to clean approximately 76 storm-water structures, (i.e., catch basins, drop inlets, and manholes) throughout, in accordance with the following:

1.	Remove all water and clean storm-water structures of all solid debris.  The estimated quantity of water and solids to be removed is 8,000 gallons and 9 tons respectively.
2.	Contractor shall obtain all necessary permits to perform this work in accordance with US EPA, RI DEM and Narragansett Bay Commission rules and regulations.
3.	Contractor is responsible to follow all other pertinent Safety, Health, Environmental, and Department of Transportation regulations.
4.	Disposal of the solids and liquids from the storm-water structures will be at a facility(s) acceptable to the RI DEM for final disposal of said solids/liquids.  The contractor will provide documentation that the final disposal facility(s) is acceptable to the RI DEM and also by the state where the disposal will occur.  This documentation must be secured and the site agreed to by the VA prior to beginning this project.
5.	All storm-water structures will be inspected for any contamination with oil or other visible contaminant(s).  If a storm-water structure has visible oil or other chemical contamination the contents will be cleaned out and all solids and liquids will be drummed in DOT compliant drums, and labeled for disposal.
6.	If there is no visible oil or chemical contamination, the water from the storm-water structure will be collected and stored in a short term storage unit, provided by the contractor.  The solids will then be vacuumed and put into a contractor supplied, covered roll-off container.  The contractor will locate the roll-off on site at a location approved by the COTR.  This container must be covered to prevent collection and accumulation of rain water, while in storage. 
7.	When the storm-water structures have all been cleaned, a representative sample of the collected liquid will be sent to a certified laboratory for analysis.  The sample will be sent for 24 hour turn around, and  the analysis will test for the following to verify that the waste is not a RCRA hazardous waste, and to ensure it is properly disposed of:
a.	RCRA 8 metals (Arsenic, Barium, Cadmium, Chromium, Lead, Mercury, Selenium, Silver)
b.	Additional metals: Copper, Nickel, Zinc
c.	Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons
8.	When the storm-water structures have all been cleaned, a representative sample of the collected solids will be sent to a certified laboratory for analysis.  The sample will be sent for 24 hour turn around, and the analysis will test for the following to verify that the waste is not a RCRA hazardous waste, and to ensure it is properly disposed of:
a.	RCRA 8 metals (Arsenic, Barium, Cadmium, Chromium, Lead, Mercury, Selenium, Silver)
b.	Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons
9.	Copies of all lab results will be provided to the COTR in order to document the appropriate disposal option chosen.
10.	If the liquid or solid portion of the waste is determined to be hazardous waste, as defined by RCRA, the COTR will be consulted for direction and change order(s).
11.	 When it has been determined that the solid and/or liquid that has been containerized is NOT a hazardous waste, the contractor will dispose of the solid and liquid phases at the locations agreed upon in item 4.  Contractor will provide receipts for disposal, to include actual totals of solids and liquids to document the proper disposal of the material. 
12.	Quoted price shall include the per diem costs for both the roll off and the liquid on site storage units.
13.	 For competitive price comparison, include the estimated price for the complete job including 7 days rental of both roll off and liquid storage containers.

The systems are commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items.  All prices will be evaluated at the time of award.   

This action is unsuitable for full and open completion for the following reasons:  The system is the only system which, based on government testing results, meets the necessary commercial and military band certifications and weight restrictions.  The end items being purchased were specifically tested as part of the Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2), Rapid Response Kits (RRK) and are the only systems that have been certified through interoperability certification.
  The systems being procured are manufactured and distributed solely by L-3 Communications Global Comms (GCS), Victor, New York.  Currently, no other source meets the certification requirements for interoperability with the DJC2 RRK.  

The COTS items being purchased were specifically tested, evaluated, and certified as part of the DJC2 RRK by the Naval Network Warfare Command.  Other COTS items would require extensive engineering testing and certification which would result in the required deliverable dates not being achieved.  Delivery is required 14 weeks after contract award.   Delivery will be made to the Receiving Officer, Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD), 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City FL 32407.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in
order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved
by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over
the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.

listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required
to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

The maximum combination of orders is $30,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. Task orders issued as a result of HubZone contracts will be firm-fixed price.  The minimum guarantee for the HUBZone MATOC contract is $2,500 that applies to the base period only. The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders. <br><br>CONTRACT INFORMATION: HUBZone solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as "Offerors") may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capacity in accordance with the criteria described in Phase 1 solicitation and intends to select no more than five (5) of the Offerors to compete in Phase 2.  In addition, the Government reserves the right to select more than five (5) of the Phase 1 Offerors if, in the opinion of the Source Selection Authority, consideration of additional Offerors is warranted. In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.  <br><br>The following evaluation (rating) criteria listed below shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals:<br><br> 	Phase 1 - VOLUME 1: Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach   <br><br>	Phase 2 - Volume 2: Design Technical; Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Small Business Participation.

Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due no later than 09/21/2012 (30 - 45 days from issuance of the solicitation).

All contracts will remain active unless or until (1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; (2) contract expiration; (3) task order completion; (4) the capacity  is reached; or (5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government.  There must be a minimum of at least two awards to create this  MATOC pool but, if there are not enough Offerors in this pool to establish at least two or more contract awards, the remaining contract capacity of that MATOC pool will be distributed by; (1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the pools that have not been awarded, or (2) re-advertising the solicitation after ensuring that the evaluation criteria established in the solicitation were not overly restrictive which resulted in limiting competition.  Option 1 would not be a viable solution if all other pools have been awarded.  If option 1 is not viable and the evaluation criteria have been reviewed then SWD reserves the right to solicit an additional MATOC pool only for the amount of the un-awarded capacity. New market research will be conducted to determine the appropriate set-aside, if any, for the MATOC for the un-awarded capacity.  Each small business synopsis and solicitation would notify potential Offerors of this reservation.    <br><br>The total estimated contract capacity is $63,960,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.  <br><br>The anticipated solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening. This solicitation is set-aside for competitive HUBZone businesses only.  Plans and Specifications will not be provided in a hard paper copy since electronic copy of the solicitation with specifications and drawings will be posted on Fed Biz Opps (www.fbo.gov). Offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and not a debarred Contractor in order to be considered for a Government award contract. <br><br><br>

<p>The sustainment of TBMCS-FL is being performed at Hill AFB, Utah by both Government and contracted personnel. The TBMCS-FL sustainment knowledge and experience level at Hill AFB is in a growth mode and has not yet reached "steady state". A portion of the overall TBMCS-FL sustainment effort at Hill AFB is accomplished by contractor provided support personnel, via a small business, 8(a) set aside contract. This existing contract for support will expire in the first quarter of 2013 and a replacement for that contract is anticipated. Sustainment efforts for this program will occur at Hill AFB and include such activities as; Software Coding, Testing, Systems Engineering, Information Assurance, Training, Fielding, and System Administration. The Government provides all facilities and equipment to perform the sustainment activity at Hill AFB.</p>
<p>Sustainment of TBMCS-FL requires continuous, uninterrupted service in order to prevent a break in service which could negatively affect the Warfighter. Hill AFB's overall TBMCS-FL sustainment skills, capabilities and knowledge have not yet reached a point of maturity. Due to the on-going growth of the Hill sustainment capability a loss of TBMCS-FL sustainment skill, experience and knowledge could have detrimental effects on Hill's overall ability to perform TBMCS-FL sustainment activities.</p>
<p>Hill AFB is searching for industry sources that have systems integration and hardware/software engineering experience in sustainment of products that include Command and Control (C2) applications that includes integration of hardware/software updates required to maintain capabilities in fielded systems, sustainment services associated with integrated C2 systems that are largely dependent on commercial hardware/software technologies and heavily reliant on interfaces with related external systems with the goal of providing contractor support personnel to Hill AFB.</p>
<p>The security clearance level for this effort is Secret and the amount of foreign participation in this request for information has not been determined at this time.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: Below are the TBMCS-FL descriptions and a Contractor Capability Survey for use in preparing a response to this RFI. Respondents should be 8(a). Responders should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary or competition sensitive and should mark them accordingly. Participants are strongly encouraged to provide information via electronic transmittal (i.e., email message with appropriate attachments). Responses to this request for information are requested to be limited to fifteen (15) pages (single sided, 1 inch borders, single line spaced and utilizing Times New Roman font with 12-dot pitch) and received NLT 8:00 AM MST on&nbsp;5 Nov&nbsp;12. All questions regarding this RFI (Technical or Programmatic) must be addressed to Mr. Brady Smith, Contract Negotiator, via email at brady.smith@hill.af.mil. No other individuals are authorized to represent the U.S. Government in regards to this request.</p>
<p>TBMCS-FL DESCRIPTION: TBMCS-FL is a system used by the United States Army (USA), United States Navy (USN), United States Marine Corps (USMC) and the United States Air Force (USAF) to plan and execute air-war campaigns. TBMCS-FL integrates force-level Command, Control and Intelligence systems in compliance with the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) Common Operating Environment (COE) as well as industry standards. TBMCS-FL provides automated command and control (C2) and decision support tools to plan, prepare for, and execute an air campaign during peacetime, exercises, war, humanitarian missions, and operations other than war. In support of joint and coalition operations, TBMCS-FL is used to build the Air Battle Plan (ABP), and publish and disseminate the Air Tasking Order (ATO) and Airspace Control Order (ACO). TBMCS-FL is the sole system providing this capability for the Air and Space Operations Centers (AOCs); aboard Navy aircraft carriers and command ships; with Marine Corps Air Wings and support units; and at North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) Regions/Sectors/Wings. In this capacity, TBMCS-FL has been an integral part in major conflicts such as Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and other contingency operations supporting US and coalition forces worldwide.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) is a complex of radioactive waste treatment processing facilities designed and constructed by Bechtel National, Inc. for the Department of Energy (DOE). The facility will process the Hanford Site tank waste and convert the waste into a stable glass form. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The Project site is located in the 200 East Area of the Hanford Reservation near Richland, Washington, along the Columbia River. The site elevation varies from 662 to 684 feet above mean sea level.&nbsp; Ambient temperature range is -23 degrees F minimum to 113 degrees F maximum, with relative humidity of 5% minimum to 100% maximum. The project design life is 40 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The WTP design incorporates the closed cell or "black cell: concept as a key part of the facility design for the PTF and HLW facilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This entails locating certain equipment in shielded cells for which no maintenance or entry is planned for the 40-year design life of the plant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Key to the approach is the limitation of equipment in the black cell to types that require no maintenance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the contents of the black cells are limited to vessels and associated pumping, mixing and sampling systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These systems employ fluidics (air-driven pulse jet mixers {PJMs} and reverse flow diverter {RFD} pumps with no moving parts) rather than motor-driven pumps or mechanical agitators to avoid equipment requiring maintenance or repair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, most of the fluid systems are low pressure, low temperature systems which have low working stresses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the black cells of WTP, detailed in-service inspection of vessels and piping during operation is impractical since access has not been provided or the radiation levels are too high to permit personnel access.</span></p>

<p>2. What experience do you have in providing residential reentry services?</p>
<p>3. Are there any other residential reentry center facilities in the area?</p>
<p>4. Are there any state or local ordinances/restrictions that would prohibit or that would considerably slow down the procurement process (i.e., building permits or leasing/rental agreements)?</p>
<p>5. Are there any known local area concerns? Do you think the area would be supportive of the BOP program? Are there any known groups or organizations that would oppose the operation of a residential (halfway) house in this area?</p>

<p>The USDA Forest Service, Bridger-Teton National Forest currently occupies space and facilities on owned land in Jackson, Wyoming. Approximately 5 acres of land is up for sale to the City of Jackson. The outcome of the sale will be determined on November 6, if a bond initiative is passed to purchase the property. If the initiative is passed, the Forest Service will seek to lease approximately 6,042 rentable square feet of storage and guard station space. The proposed acreage on the initiative holds four buildings that contain the current storage and a Fire Crew station for the Bridger-Teton NF. The lease term requirement will be for 1 year with 6 automatic 1-year renewals cancellable by either party with a 90 days written notice. The space must be available for occupancy by January 1, 2013. The delineated area is north, east, and west of Mercill Ave. to the city limits of Jackson, Wyoming.</p>
<p>The Forest Service is considering alternative space ONLY if economically advantageous. The Forest Service will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Forest Service will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Forest Service's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Please send expressions of interest no later than Thursday, September 11, 2012, 5:00 pm MST to: <br />Ann Allan<br />324 25th St.<br />Ogden, UT 84401<br />Telephone: 801-625-5832<br />Fax: 801-625-5365<br />Email: aallan@fs.fed.us</p>
<p>Expressions of Interest must include the following information:<br />&bull; Building name and address and location of the available space within the building;<br />&bull; Rentable square feet available, and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced;<br />&bull; Date of space availability;<br />&bull; Building ownership information;<br />&bull; Amount of parking available on-site;<br />&bull; Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building;<br />&bull; List of building services to be provided.</p>
<p>The Forest Service's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this announcement.</p>

		NOTE: Hardware/software update/upgrade installations will be scheduled and performed outside normal hours of coverage at no additional charge to the Government (unless it would be detrimental to equipment up-time; to be determined by the COR).

C.13	PENALTIES

	A. 	Contractor shall be liable to the Government for losses of production due to significant equipment downtime.  Significant equipment downtime is that which exceeds ________10_______ percent of the normal hours of coverage per quarter.  Records regarding downtime will be kept by the COR and the maintenance contractor.

	B	Equipment downtime is calculated only from those normal hours of coverage, see Hours of Coverage Section C.4, that the scheduled equipment is not fully operational.  Downtime will begin when the contractor is required to be on site (see Unscheduled Maintenance Section C.6 response time definition), after notification by the CO, COR, or designated alternate.  Downtime will accumulate until the scheduled equipment is returned to full and usual operation, per the Conformance Standards Section C.3, and accepted as such by the CO, COR or designated alternate.  Scheduled service shall be excluded from downtime.  Refusal of access to the equipment indicates that the unit is up and running and this time will not be considered when determining downtime.  Refusal of access to the equipment voids the service call.

	
	C.	Monies will be subtracted from the contract if the contractor exceeds the equipment downtime limits using the following formula.

		Quarterly Downtime					Monies
					0% to  		10    	%/quarter	 0%
				11	  % to  	25		%/quarter	25%
				26	  % to  	35		%/quarter	50%
				36	  % to  	50		%/quarter	75%
					over    	51		%/quarter	100%

		These will be computed for quarterly dollar totals.  Failure to meet these downtime limits can also result in default action.

	D.	If downtime exceeds __________24_____________ consecutive hours of coverage, the COR may exercise the option to hire an alternate source to resolve the problem.  The decision to exercise this alternative will reside exclusively with the COR.  All fees generated by the alternate Contractor(s) will be handled in accordance with the default clause.

C.14	INITIAL CONTRACTOR INSPECTION AND SUBMITTALS

	A.	All Contractor inspections and submittals must be done within thirty days after this contract has been awarded to the Contractor. 

	B.	Equipment placed under maintenance contract for the first time shall be subject to inspection by the Contractor.  Within a thirty (30) day period after award of the contract, the Contractor shall reject any equipment deemed to be in poor operating condition.  Failure to reject such equipment shall constitute acceptance.  Upon rejection, the CO and COR shall be notified in writing as to the specific item(s) of equipment deemed to be in poor operating condition.  Failure to inspect the equipment prior to contract award will not relieve the Contractor from performance of the requirements of this contract.

	C.	As stated in Section C.5, the Contractor shall perform scheduled preventive maintenance on contracted equipment manufacturer's specifications.  Within a thirty day period after award of the contract, the Contractor shall submit to the COR, at no cost, a copy of these preventive maintenance procedures that the Contractor will follow.

<RESPDATE>080912
<CONTACT>Munira Mwalimu, Contracting Officer, Phone 2023576906, Email Munira.Mwalimu@ed.gov
<DESC><strong>Purpose:<br /></strong>The National Assessment Governing Board intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract with the Educational Policy Improvement Center (EPIC) to undertake additional research and analysis of college course content in order to determine relationships between the content of college courses and the content of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). This work is in furtherance of the Governing Board's initiative on NAEP Grade 12 Preparedness Research. This requirement is pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1) (i) as only one responsible source will satisfy the Governing Board's requirements. Capability statements in response to this notice are to be submitted in accordance with the&nbsp;requirements noted below. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.&nbsp;<br />
<p><strong>Background:<br /></strong>The National Assessment Governing Board, an independent, bipartisan organization, sets policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), commonly known as The Nation's Report Card. NAEP makes objective information on student performance available to policy makers and the public at the national, state, and local levels. More information on the Governing Board and its work is at www.nagb.org.</p>
<p>The Governing Board is currently conducting research to determine what and how NAEP can report on the academic preparedness in reading and mathematics of 12th grade students for college and job training. Reports on the Governing Board's 12th Grade Preparedness Research are available at http://www.nagb.org/publications/reports-papers.htm.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of Work:</strong><br />The Governing Board's work on 12th Grade Preparedness Research requires the identification of skills necessary for students to be academically prepared, without remediation, for first-year college level reading and mathematics. This work requires a description of the skills in each subject and, ultimately, to locate the point on the NAEP 12th grade reading and mathematics scales that represents such skills.</p>
<p>As a part of this research, the Governing Board seeks to collect and analyze actual course materials for a sample of relevant entry-level credit-bearing college courses that satisfy general education requirements for a degree, without remediation. In reading, the focus would be on course materials that reflect the reading demands of first-year credit bearing college courses in the humanities and the social sciences. In mathematics, the focus would be on materials for first year credit bearing courses that meet general education requirements for quantitative reasoning, such as college algebra. The general education requirements of interest are first-year courses that satisfy requirements to obtain a Bachelor's degree, such as college algebra and introduction to psychology. Course materials include but are not limited to syllabi, textbooks, and course assignments. Course materials will be analyzed in order to evaluate the content of courses and to identify knowledge and skills in reading and mathematics prerequisite to qualifying for these courses. <br />&emsp;<br />The initial analysis will require the following resources:</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp; Previously developed descriptions of minimal academic preparedness requirements used for setting cut scores on NAEP; <br />&bull;&nbsp; All items in the 2009 NAEP item pool;<br />&bull;&nbsp; Items in the 2009 NAEP item pool representing performance on NAEP near the preparedness cut scores identified through the Board's judgmental standard setting research on college preparedness; and<br />&bull;&nbsp; Items in the 2009 NAEP item pools that map in the range between the NAEP Basic and Proficient achievement levels at the 12th grade.</p>
<p>For reading and mathematics, this project will address four core research questions:</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp; What is the prerequisite knowledge and skills in reading and mathematics to qualify for first-year credit-bearing courses that satisfy general education requirements?<br />&bull;&nbsp; How do these prerequisites compare with previous NAEP preparedness research?<br />&bull;&nbsp; How do these prerequisites compare with the 2009 NAEP reading and mathematics frameworks and item pools? <br />&bull;&nbsp; How can these prerequisites inform future NAEP preparedness research?</p>
<p>Based on the results, additional analyses may be required on NAEP reading and mathematics item pools for 2013 and later assessments at grade 12, and possibly for 8th grade as well for NAEP science and writing assessments. This&nbsp;work may require an additional option period of 12 months to be negotiated as needed.<br /><br />The collection of information on college course content will allow the Governing Board to determine how NAEP can report on academic preparedness of 12th grade students in reading and mathematics.</p>
<p><strong>Justification for Only One Responsible Source:<br /></strong>EPIC is uniquely qualified to conduct the proposed research studies due to the fact that EPIC has extensive experience in analyzing the content of entry-level college courses. The organization's 15 years experience includes studies of entry-level courses at universities conducted in partnership with the Association of American Universities; identification of "best practices" courses in multiple subject areas nationally for the College Board's use in the revision of Advanced Placement course designs; validation of the Texas College and Career Readiness Standards in relation to the content of entry-level courses in all public post-secondary institutions in Texas; and, most recently, collection of syllabi, assignments, and assessments from nearly 2,000 entry-level courses from a national sample in order to determine the degree to which the Common Core State Standards align with college course content.</p>
<p>In the process of conducting these studies and gathering and analyzing course information, EPIC has designed and implemented new techniques for content analysis and reporting that yield insight into the knowledge and skills necessary for student readiness to succeed in entry-level college courses and of the alignment between standards systems and college course content. These data sets will be accessed to conduct the required analysis on college course content. Additional data collection may be required, but a majority of the work will use existing data sets solely available to EPIC, thus eliminating duplication&nbsp;in data collection, maximizing project efficiencies, and achieving cost savings.</p>
<p>Further, EPIC is currently conducting research on course content materials provided by higher education institutions and content experts for the reading NAEP and the mathematics NAEP, as a subcontractor with WestEd under contract # ED-NAG-10-C-0004. This work is a part of the Board's ongoing 12th grade preparedness research. The goal of these studies is to determine the prerequisite knowledge and skills required for entry in job training courses for five occupations. This course content analysis research proposed for college preparedness is parallel to the work currently underway for job training preparedness and will employ a methodology developed by EPIC specifically for the course content analysis research studies in the job training areas as described above. The experience applying this methodology in this unique context using NAEP, makes EPIC uniquely qualified to conduct this research.</p>
<p><strong>Contract Type and Period of Performance:<br /></strong>The contract type is planned as a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract, awarded in accordance with the requirements of FAR Subpart 16.202. The contract base period of performance is 24 months with an option period of 12 months.</p>
<p><strong>Capability Statements:<br /></strong>Interested parties may submit capability statements to Munira.Mwalimu@ed.gov no later than August 9, 2012 at 10:00 a.m. ET. All information submitted should support the capability to provide the services required, and shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. Capability statements received in response to this notice will be evaluated solely for determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. The capability statements must be in writing and must provide clear and concise documentation indicating capability to provide these services.

Synopsis:

The purpose of this Sources sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside.
  The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 336413 which has a corresponding size standard of 1000 employees. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement.  The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns.  The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code.  Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years.
  Any responses involving teaming arrangements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners. 

This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an RFP or commitment by the Government.  DLA Aviation at Philadelphia anticipates possible award of a contract  to execute an Enterprise Performance Based Logistics (EPBL) program in support of various supplies consisting of repairable NSNs for  support of the A-10, B-1, B-2, E-3, H-60, F-15, C-5, F/A-18, F-16, V-22, P-3, C-2, C-130, Gas Turbine Engines for Ground Start Carts, CH-47, and M-1.    All of the supplies will be provided under a performance based logistics construct with availability and reliability metrics used to gauge contractor performance.
 Other metrics may be included. The contractor will be paid based on the aggregate flight hours, operating hours or other appropriate measurements of usage of the specific weapon systems. The DLRs that will be included in this contract are currently procured under various contracts with the DLA, USAF, USA and USN.  The contract will also include necessary support of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers. The anticipated Contract will be strategic in nature and will be the primary vehicle for procurement of a wide range of supplies. Various Government approved operational sites will be supported by this effort. The contractor will be required to deliver their supplies to Government wholesale and retail supply points both CONUS and OCONUS within specified time windows and at contractor expense.
   Performance will include a five year base period with one five year option to extend the contract for a total performance period of ten years. 

Honeywell International Inc. (HII) is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of these items with design control, authorization, and documentation to manufacture.  HII owns the limited data rights to these items.  The Government does not have the drawings or complete data packages. However, some technical repair manuals and usage data is available by request from the owning service.  

Under a EPBL contract, a Contractor will carry out logistics functions for the depot level repairables while meeting daily Services demand requirements (i.e., filling various Services  requisitions) within a specified  response time to CONUS and OCONUS destinations.
  DLA requires strategies that would include partnering with Government entities such as Organic Depots.  

PBL contract logistics functions generally include: repair and/or replacement of the covered items, inventory management, warehousing, configuration management, obsolescence management, training, and sustaining engineering/ maintaining reliability. There are approximately 450 DLR items in 93 Federal Supply Codes (FSC) to be covered by this contract, with flexibility/processes to add more items as requirements dictate. 

The contract will be constructed to allow for the addition of DLRs to the initial population post-award.  An initial DLR population of up to 450 items has been identified.
 A full list of NIINs and the respective FSCs is attached.
 

Any entity interested in providing some of the required products but cannot provide the required PBL outcome will be afforded an opportunity to partner with potential prime contractors.

It must bend the mirror from -175 to +175 Km preserving mirror shape errors after best sphere subtraction.</p>
<p>The entire mirror chamber must provided a very stable support, able to guarantee the above required tolerances and stability. The preferred support type is a granite base, directly connected to the floor through long stud bolt. <br />All parts and subassemblies shall be cleaned for UHV.The base pressure must be lower than 5x10-10 mbar (3.5x10-10 torr) with the mirror and all the actuators installed.</p>

The contractor will be responsible for implementation of the process to include compliance reviews of programs and their corresponding VA medical centers in cooperation with the VHA Homeless Programs Office.  The compliance reviews will be on-site and will include locations designated by the program office based on a risk analysis system.  The work will encompass a representative sample of these programs (approximately 33% of programs each year) and occur over a period of the next three years.  The contractor will review site-developed services at various locations nationally to determine compliance (administrative and services) with existing authorizing laws, rules and regulations; and VA circulars, directives, handbooks or other documents that determine and specify program operational standards.  Concurrent with the site review, the contractor will develop, with the entity, action plans to correct noted deficiencies found as a result of the site review.  The contractor will work conjointly with the entity to correct deficiencies and will develop a process of follow up and close out to ensure deficiencies are addressed.  The contractor will provide expert assistance in the form of evaluation, review and guidance for the entity to ensure all corrective actions are completed and that the completion of these items meets VA standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring close out has occurred, which may require on-site re-inspection and/or document reviews.  Based on the recommendations of these reviews, and in coordination with VHA Homeless Programs office staff, the contractor will put in place processes to ensure that recommendations are implemented and action items or action steps are implemented and completed by the responsible parties in a timely manner.  The contractor will provide comprehensive reports to the VHA Homeless Programs Office to include (but not limited to):  summarize site reviews conducted; compliance deficiencies per site; follow-up plan developed for each site; and review of follow-up and close-out.  Information will be provided in a format that allows VHA Homeless Programs Office to: review and track programs; oversee reviews; assess gaps and deficiencies found as a result of the reviews for analysis purposes; and determine the contractor's compliance with contract deliverables.  To contribute relevance to the tasks and reports, the contractor will provide assistance as necessary to VHA Homeless Programs Office.

<DESC>NOTICE OF SOLE SOURCE AWARD - CONTRACT # FA4418-13-F-0008<br />(In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(2))
<p><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of a sole source award under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 8.405-6, Limited Sources.<br /><br />The Reference Number is FA4418-13-F-0008. The 628th Contracting Squadron, 101 E. Hill Blvd., Charleston AFB SC, awarded a contract for maintenance on Pyxis pharmacy machines to CareFusion Solutions of San Diego, CA 92130. Market research and information gathered determined this company to be the only source for this requirement.</p>
<p>The Justification for the Sole Source Award is as follows:<br /><br />In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(c)(2):</p>
<p>i. Agency and Activity: 628 Contracting Squadron, Joint Base Charleston, SC.<br />ii. Nature of the action being approved: sole source justification approval.<br />iii. The purpose of this acquisition is to: renew the maintenance agreement on Pyxis pharmacy machines.<br />iv. Authority and Supporting Rationale: IAW FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B): Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized. <br />v. The contracting officer has determined that the order represents the best value consistent with 8.404(d). <br />vi. Description of market research: A search of GSA schedule holders and other open market sources revealed no other source capable of fulfilling the requirement.<br />vii. Other facts supporting the justification: CareFusion is the sole manufacturer and exclusive provider of sales and service for Pyxis products in the United States. CareFusion does not contract these services to 3rd parties, therefore there are no other sources capable of meeting the requirement.<br />viii. Actions to prevent barriers that led to restricted consideration in the future: Continue to survey the market for competition.<br />ix. This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br />x. Evidence that supporting data is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel: A justification was provided by the customer's technical representative that stated their research indicates CareFusion is the only brand capable of meeting the requirement.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF SOLE SOURCE AWARD - CONTRACT # FA4418-13-P-0022<br />(In accordance with FAR 6.305)
<p><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of a sole source award under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1: Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br /><br />The Reference Number is FA4418-13-P-0022. The 628th Contracting Squadron, 101 E. Hill Blvd., Charleston AFB SC, awarded a contract for tobacco quit line to The American Lung Association (ALA) of Springfield, IL 62711-6226. Market research and information gathered determined this company to be the only source for this requirement.</p>
<p>The Justification for the Sole Source Award is as follows:<br /><br />In accordance with FAR 6.303-2:<br />(1) Agency and Activity: 628 Contracting Squadron, Joint Base Charleston, SC.<br /><br />(2) Nature of the action being approved: Sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>(3) The purpose of this acquisition is to renew the tobacco quit line service.</p>
<p>(4) Justification Rationale: IAW FAR 6.302-1(a)(2): Only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work.</p>
<p>(5) Demonstration of Unique Qualifications: The American Lung Association (ALA) Quit Line is a toll-free smoking cessation number distributed by the Health and Wellness Center (HAWC) to counsel Air Force personnel who desire to stop smoking. Each caller receives individualized tobacco cessation information and a free packet of materials outlining the smoking cessation process and recommendations from a Tobacco Cessation Specialist made based upon the individual's nicotine consumption.</p>
<p>(6) Description of Solicitation Efforts: GSA Advantage and SAM were queried for alternative sources, however none are able to meet the Government's requirement. IAW FAR 5.201, this sole source notice will be posted on the Government-wide Point of Entry (FedBizOpps).</p>
<p>(7) The contracting officer has determined that the anticipated price to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on comparison of similar medical phone help services.</p>
<p>(8) Description of market research: A search of GSA schedules and open market sources yielded no sources able to provide this particular service.</p>
<p>(9) Other supporting facts: 35 Air Force Bases are currently utilizing the ALA Quit Line services. The American Lung Association is a proven provider with great success at Joint Base Charleston and maintaining a continuity of service is necessary to the continued success of the program. Discontinuing the ALA services would have an adverse effect on the tobacco users' success of quitting which negatively impacts the Joint Base Charleston Fit to Fight program objectives.</p>
<p>(10) Interested Sources: Market research indicates this service is provided only by the American Lung Association.</p>
<p>(11) Actions to prevent barriers that may lead to restricted consideration in the future: Continue to survey the market for tobacco quit line services.</p>
<p>(12) This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

United States Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION Solicitation No. R12PS34117 Contract Specialist:  Jacqueline Carrera Solicitation Title: Floway Brand Pump System Replacements
In accordance with FAR 6.302, the proposed contractual action is pursuant to the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)( 1 ). 
1.	Agency and Contracting Activity. Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region, Yuma Area Office (YAO).
2.	Nature/Description of Action. The YAO requests to issue a FFP with Economic Price Adjustment contract on a sole source basis with Phoenix Pumps, Inc. of Phoenix, AZ; for the purchase of turbine pump and motor systems for the YAO operated wellfields.  3.	Description of Supplies/Services. This request is to establish an IDIQ contract with a five year duration and an estimated value of $3,000,000.00 for the purchase of Floway brand replacement turbine pump and motor systems.  
4.	 Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition.  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)	FAR 6.302-1	Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
5.	Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications. This request is for Floway vertical turbine pump and motor replacements.  Several years ago, in YAO's attempt to meet procurement competition requirements, YAO acquired multiple brand name pumps. This method of procurement caused the YAO to carry multiple spare parts that became obsolete as pump manufacturers went out of business and parts would not interchange between brands.  As all pumps manufactures have proprietary pump design systems that make it impossible for any two systems to be interchanged, YAO determined several years ago to standardize the well field pump systems. The decision to standardize was made due to costly down times and the inability to reduce the cost of stocking spare parts and training for the staff as every brand has unique operating features.  The effects of the down time put the YAO at risk of not meeting mandated water delivery requirements as specified in the 1942 Treaty with Mexico and the water contracts the YAO has with water districts to control the groundwater level as directed by Congress.  Several pump system manufacturers participated in the exercise and all pump systems were considered and evaluated to determine which pump system met the operating conditions criteria.  
The Government determined that the Floway brand pump was the best pump system to efficiently operate in the unique aquifer conditions of the Yuma well fields.  The Floway brand pumps was found to be the best option for handling the high ground water conditions and water mining with production wells. Floway also provides for unique features such as pre-lube and non-pre-lube pump installation which enabled the YAO to use one brand of pump to perform both pumping conditions. With the use of Floway brand turbine pumps it enables the YAO to prevent costly down time since the spare parts in stock can be used with the new replacement pump systems as well as existing installed pump systems. When a pump is down and no longer considered useful, some parts within that pump system are still operable and considered valuable.  These parts are interchanged with other Floway pumps parts which help build additional pump systems saving the YAO hundreds of thousands of dollars.  It also allowed the YAO maintenance staff to swap internal parts of existing pump systems to adapt with the changing ground water conditions. 
The standardization of the pump systems has resulted in significant cost savings to the Government in maintenance and personnel costs.  The standardization has averaged an annual costs savings of $500,000. This savings has been attributed to lowering the number of different brand name spare parts needed to be maintained and enabled the YAO to reduce the full time equivalency (FTE) maintenance staff by 3. 
Standardizing the well field has enabled YAO maintenance staff to increase pumping for water delivery and ground water management due to less down time and interchanging parts allowed better pump efficiency.   If another pump brand is purchased, it would put YAO into the same problem as dealt with in the past and existing stocked spare parts would become obsolete. It would increase down time due to the lead time of materials can range from 3 to 4 months.  YAO production wells use Floway brand products in their operation and an inventory of Floway pumps and motors are maintained for standardization and operational consistency.  To maintain a standardized inventory and operational reliability, additional Floway brand pumps and motors are required to replace parts that are inoperable in the wells.  Purchasing Floway pumps achieves reduced inventory costs, production down time and increased efficiency.
The unique aquifer conditions of the Yuma well fields and operation and maintenance requirements remain the same.
Phoenix Pumps, Inc. is the only authorized representative for Weir Minerals North America, manufacturer of Floway Pumps, to process orders for Arizona.
6.	Description of efforts made to maximize competition.  Pursuant to FAR 5.101(a), a synopsis notice of the contract action was posted on the FedBizOps website on March 28, 2012, with a response date of April 11, 2012.  No inquiries were received from interested vendors in response to the synopsis notice.
7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost. The estimated unit prices for each pump are based on previous purchases (Contract Nos. R11PC34094 & R11PC34239) for similar items, but price may be lower or higher due to the fluctuation of material costs.  Pricing will be evaluated on each delivery order.
8.	Description of Market Research Conducted.  See paragraph 5 above.
9.	Any Other Supporting Facts. With the use of Floway brand turbine pumps it enables the YAO to prevent costly down time since the spare parts in stock can be used with the new replacement pump systems as well as existing installed pump systems. When a pump is down and no longer considered useful, some parts within that pump system are still operable and considered valuable.  These parts are interchanged with other Floway pumps parts which help build additional pump systems saving the YAO hundreds of thousands of dollars.  The standardization of the pump systems has resulted in significant cost savings to the Government in maintenance and personnel costs.  The standardization has averaged an annual costs savings of $500,000. This savings has been attributed to lowering the number of different brand name spare parts needed to be maintained and enabled the YAO to reduce the full time equivalency (FTE) maintenance staff by 3.  10.	Listing of Interested Sources.  No sources expressed an interest in the acquisition as a result of the synopsis notice posted in FedBizOps.
11.	Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition. See paragraphs 5, 6 and 10 above.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (Department) has been participating in an Interagency Group to manage the federal supply of helium-3 (He-3). The Interagency Group assesses and prioritizes requests for He-3 necessary for the federal mission, while simultaneously taking steps to decrease demand and increase supply. The success of the Interagency Group has mitigated short- to mid-term impacts of a He-3 shortage. In recognition of the important activities requiring He-3 that are outside of the federal mission, the Department has identified 4,000 liters of purified He-3 gas for competitive sale. Stakeholders whose Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 He-3 needs will be met by the federal allocation process, or who submitted requests for He-3 gas through a U.S. federal agency in anticipation of participating in the FY 2013 federal allocation process, should not participate in this auction. The Department wishes to sell the He-3 to multiple Bidders who submit the highest bids in a competitive bid process. Initially, each Bidder will be limited to 400 liters, but may bid on unlimited lots of 100 liters each. Should there be any He-3 remaining after the 400 liter limit has been reached by all Bidders, then remaining gas will go to the highest Bidder.
<p>He-3 is stored and will be delivered in cylinders with a Compressed Gas Association 580 brass valve. Unless otherwise specified by the Bidder, each cylinder will contain a nominal 100 liters of purified He-3, standard temperature and pressure. Cylinders are designed to U.S. Department of Transportation specification, 3AA 2015, and are refillable cylinders.<br />DOE's Invitation for Bids (IFB) for the purchase of He-3 gas is scheduled to be posted on http://www.isotopes.gov/he-3auction on October 9, 2012 and will be available for downloading from this website. The Department will accept questions regarding the IFB. All questions must be submitted to He3auction@science.doe.gov no later than 5 PM (Eastern Standard Time) October 23, 2012. DOE will respond to all questions by 5 PM (Eastern Standard Time) October 26, 2012. DOE will post all questions received and their corresponding answers on the website http://www.isotopes.gov/he-3auction. The identity of the stakeholder posing the question will be kept anonymous and will not be posted on the website.</p>
<p>All valid bids to purchase He-3 gas must be received by the U.S. Department of Energy no later than 5 PM, local prevailing time (Washington, DC) on November 6, 2012. The Department requires bids from qualified Bidders be submitted in electronic format to He3auction@science.doe.gov. A confirmation of receipt will be sent electronically within 24 hours of the next business working day. Bids will not be accepted via U.S. Postal Service mail.</p>

<a href="mailto:ronald.mazzei@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System intends to negotiate on a Sole Source basis with MIM Software, 25200 Chagrin Blvd. Suite 200, Cleveland, OH 44122, to purchase and have installed, a Quantity of (2) of MIM Maestro Medical Software with ancillary equipment (Item Code - MIM-FSCOCA), estimated at $53,500, for the following reasons:   

It is essential to the Government's needs to purchase and have installed, MIM Software Maestro Pathology Imaging Software ,with ancillary Dell PC, as a total system that represents the Governments minimum  need, since this Software has the following features, not available in any other company's similar product, and since only MIM Software is the sole exclusive seller and installer of this software product within the U.S. (See attached Sole Source Justification Memorandum)

Features:

The MIM System can process images and data from many other commercial systems allowing us to combine images that are not possible with our existing computer systems.   It has the capability to do deformable registration of images . This allows us to adjust treatment plans to changes in the patient during treatment.  This also allows us to use diagnostic images taken in non treatment position.  
The edge detection used in PET has been shown to be superior to standard methods.

 Other characteristics:

1.	Voxalign Deformation Engine for accurate modality deformation

2.	Autocontouring that allows sites to include their own previous patients as subjects in the atlas to improve results at each site

3.	ART Assist for automated, customizable CBCT reports to monitor your planning and guide replanning decisions

4.	Simultaneous registration and display of any number of modalities - no limit to number of modalities displayed or screen layout options

5.	User-customizable workflows to automate processes to users' exact preference (adaptive recontouring, dose accumulation, etc)

6.	Contour CoPilot tool for fast slice-to-slice contour creation or editing

7.	PETedge tool for creating accurate target volumes in PET with more accurate contouring and therapy response assessment using quantified functional data from PET

8.	Structured reports for customizable report generation for dose constraints, therapy response or any statistical, contour or image analysis

9.	Statistics viewer to quickly generate reports, charts, graphs, screen captures, or PDFs for use in plan reports on treatment planning systems.

The MIM System can process images and data from many other commercial systems allowing us to combine images that are not possible with our existing computer systems.  Computer search determine that no other companies had this capability.

The MIM system is unique in the way that it can fuse two different images from different scans of the same person. For example if a patient has a diagnostic PET/CT and is later sent to Radiation therapy, MIM lets us stretch the scan to match a CT in our treatment position.  Then we do not need to repeat the PET scan.  No other commercial system can do this.

This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Parties may identify their interest; accompanied by supporting literature, to the Contracting Officer no later than 10/9/2012 at 4:00PM. Responses should be sent to ronald.mazzei@va.gov. No telephone responses will be accepted. Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 511210 and the small business size standard for this NAICS Code is $25 Million.

The policy of the Department of the Navy (including the Marine Corps) is to deter and detect drug offenses by contract employees on military installations. Measures to be taken to identify drug offenses on military installations, and to prevent introduction of illegal drugs and paraphernalia, include routine, random inspections of vehicles on entry or exit, with drug detection dog teams, when available, and random inspection of personal possessions on entry or exit.
 When there is probable cause to believe that a Contractor employee on board a Naval or Marine Corps installation has been engaged in use, possession or trafficking of drugs, that employee may be restricted or detained for the period necessary until he can be removed from the installation or can be turned over to local law enforcement authorities having jurisdiction, as appropriate. When illegal drugs are discovered in the course of an inspection or search of a vehicle operated by a Contractor employee, the employee and vehicle may be detained for a reasonable period of time necessary to turn the employee and the vehicle over to appropriate civil law enforcement officials, and action may be taken to suspend, revoke, or deny clinical privileges as well as installation driving privileges.
 Implicit with the acceptance of this contract is the agreement by the Contractor and his employees to comply with all Federal statutes, laws and regulations, including those regulations issued by the commander of the military installation. 

7.9
The Contractor shall comply with all fire prevention measures prescribed in the installation fire protection regulations that are in or may be put into effect during the course of this contract. Copies of these regulations are on file in the office of the Head, Operating Management Department or with the COR. The Contractor shall be liable for loss of Government property attributed to negligent or willful misconduct of the Contractor or his employees, including failure to comply with the fire prevention measures prescribed in the aforementioned regulations.
 At the close of operations each day, the Contractor shall be required to make a thorough inspection in each work area to determine that all necessary safeguards relative to probable fire hazards are in effect. The Contractor shall familiarize his employees with the aforementioned fire regulations, location of fire reporting telephones near work sites, and correct fire reporting procedures. The Contractor and his employees shall be cognizant of and observe all requirements for handling and storing combustible supplies and materials, daily disposal of combustible waste, trash, etc.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
(JUN 2006)
(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). 
(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) is exploring technology which will help streamline and automate the existing end-to-end print procurement workflow. The opportunity expressed in this RFI is referred to as the EPIC system. The resulting system should be scalable, provide real-time access to specified current and historical print procurement data, and be accessible to all users (e.g. GPO, commercial vendors, contractors, Federal Agencies, and public). EPIC will be aligned with GPO's Strategic Plan for FY 2012-2016 and the agency's Enterprise Architecture (EA).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It will also integrate with evolving enterprise-wide systems, including GPO's Business Information System (GBIS) and other future enterprise systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The objectives of EPIC are as follows:</p>
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0pt" type="disc">
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">To implement a system that maximizes Customer Services' print procurement workflow efficiency to provide more timely service and ultimately reduce administrative costs.</li>

<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">Replace or improve existing print procurement IT systems with a modern, modular system that meets program sponsor/owner expectations.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">To centralize print procurement information for GPO and external users.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt">To maximize process transparency for all stakeholders thereby reducing administrative effort and improving communications.</li>

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 3pt"><span style="COLOR: windowtext">Throughout its history, the Customer Services department has carried out its mission utilizing predominately manual processes with information organized in a now aging mainframe system. The material submitted to Customer Services by Federal customers represents order information that impacts stakeholders throughout the print procurement process (such as Financial Management, and GPO's Library and Sales Programs). As such, the current process introduces inefficiencies such as duplication of effort (multiple keying of same data) and creates multiple opportunities for error during translation of order information from paper submissions by customers to GPO-generated specifications, award and post-award documents, etc. In this process, pertinent information about the order must be passed to other processes within the print procurement workflow which further perpetuates errors and inefficiencies. Current systems constrain transparency within the overall workflow and tracking information is fragmented across multiple systems, which impacts the real-time sharing of information and job tracking data. </span></p>

<DESC><p>Airborne Wideband Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) Terminal<br />Request for Information (RFI)</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is seeking information. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Air Force is not seeking proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are<br />advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested Party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps.gov) website and is envisioned to be a US only corporation opportunity. It is the responsibility of the potential Responders to monitor the FedBizOpps.gov site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>The Air Force is formulating contract approaches for combining Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) Military Ka-band/Commercial Ka-band airborne SATCOM terminal system, and is seeking industry input to formulate operational concepts and to understand operational cost savings associated with maximizing use of the WGS resource. Additionally, the Government requests industry recommendations for business case formulation associated with transitioning from existing Ku-Band Aero Mobile Satellite Services (AMSS) systems to alternative Ka AMSS systems to include maximum utilization of WGS. The approach must also include an interoperability roadmap between WGS and their respective commercial satellite system. These business case formulations should consider the relative cost benefit of commercial best effort AMSS with fair use policies and commercially managed, private government AMSS.</p>
<p>As part of the Air Force's risk reduction activities, the Air Force is considering requiring Offerors to submit an airworthy prototype terminal system (modem, antenna, and ancillary components such as HPA, etc.) for an open architecture solution to be delivered, and tested, in a standardized ground-based Government test environment (configuration details are TBD at this time) at a single TBD laboratory location. Open architecture implies releasable specifications for all system signal and control interfaces with the intent to ensure interoperability for Aero Mobile Satellite Service (AMSS) competition.</p>
<p>If a complete prototype system is not available, Offerors can submit functional terminal elements (modem at a minimum) to be integrated with an Air Force prototype low-profile airborne antenna developed by the Advanced Multi-Band Communications Antenna System (AMCAS) program. The Government selected prototype terminal will be installed in an operationally-representative military aircraft to be tested over-the-air using WGS and Commercial Ka-band satellite including separate WGS and commercial ground station hub/controllers. It is envisioned that the results of the prototype testing would be used to demonstrate maturity of COTS Military Ka-band/Commercial Ka-band airborne SATCOM terminal systems. Therefore, Offeror prototype terminals or functional elements must be functional and operational as they will be tested over-the-air.</p>
<p>Based upon the information presented in this RFI, the Government requests the following information:</p>
<p>1. Would industry be supportive of submitting a prototype terminal to be tested in over-the-air demonstrations using WGS Ka-band/Commercial Ka-band installed in operationally-representative military aircraft at their own expense, as a method of demonstrating that their proposed solution is technologically mature? If a complete prototype terminal is not available, then, would industry be supportive of submitting functional terminal elements (modem at a minimum) to be integrated with the prototype AMCAS low-profile antenna? Is your waveform a MIL-STD waveform? In addition, would industry be supportive of providing commercial satellite capacity for the over-the-air proof-of-concept demonstrations?</p>
<p>2. Describe an operational concept(s) using your AMSS system in conjunction with maximizing use of WGS.&nbsp;The Government requests industry recommendations for business case formulation to include draft costing information (if available) associated with transitioning from existing Ku-Band AMSS systems to alternative Ka AMSS systems to include maximum utilization of WGS. The approach must also include an interoperability roadmap between WGS and their respective commercial satellite system. These business case formulations should consider the relative cost benefit of commercial best effort AMSS with fair use policies and commercially managed, private government AMSS.</p>
<p>3. Describe possible configurations that you believe would be at a TRL6 by FY14 that could<br />support the following characteristics:<br />a. Frequency Range: WGS and Commercial Ka-band<br />b. Antenna Coverage: Hemispheric<br />c. Data Rates: 1 - 5 Mbps (TX/RX)<br />d. Antenna Group (size, weight, and power needs - SWaP)<br />i. Antenna height (max): 6.5 inches<br />ii. Radome Height (max): 7.5 inches<br />iii. Antenna pedestal and aperture weight (max): 68 pounds<br />e. Antenna Support Electronics (SWaP)<br />i. HPA, ACU, Up/Dn Convertors, etc. combined weight (max): 35 lbs<br />f. Airborne Qualified Modem (SWaP)<br />i. Form Factor: &lt; 1 ATR short<br />ii. Weight: &lt;25 lbs</p>
<p>To assist the Government in gaining more insight into industry experience in accomplishing this kind of work, Responders who submit responses to this notice are requested to also provide the following<br />information:</p>
<p>1. Knowledge of/experience with developing, manufacturing, testing, and/or installing complex military SATCOM systems onboard aircraft.</p>
<p>2. Demonstrated evidence of robust systems engineering discipline, systems analysis, and modeling and simulation experience.</p>
<p>3. Experience with the design, development, and test of equipment designated for airborne environments. Any experience associated with in-flight satellite acquisition and tracking would also be desired.</p>
<p>4. Experience with and/or ability in providing commercial satellite access.</p>
<p>An Industry Day has been scheduled for 8:00am PT,&nbsp;25 October 2012 at the following address:<br />Los Angeles AFB, 2310 E. El Segundo Blvd. El Segundo, CA 90245 in building/room D8 1010. Preliminary responses to this RFI are requested no later than 4:00 p.m. 18 October 2012. Final responses to this RFI are requested no later than 4:00 p.m. 22 November 2012.&nbsp;Contractors should limit their response to a maximum of 50 pages. Submit your responses via email to&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Tsarouha at <a href="mailto:tsarouha@mitre.org">tsarouha@mitre.org</a> and Valeta Miller at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:valeta.miller@hanscom.af.mil">valeta.miller@hanscom.af.mil</a>. We remind firms interested in pursuing this opportunity in any prime, subcontractor, or teaming arrangement capacity of their responsibility to ensure they address and take steps to avoid and/or mitigate potential Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) issues.</p>
<p>This is especially important if a firm is presently supporting the Government through an Advisory and Assistance Services contract. Guidance is found in FAR Part 9 - Contractor Qualifications, and possibly OCI clauses in other Government contracts your firm may<br />have. A potential OCI issue exists for any firm that has personnel in any of the divisions working under contract for the Government and, therefore, through them has access to any related information originating either from the Government or from other interested firms. Such firms should examine any support contracts it has in place with the Government for provisions addressing OCI issues. A firm finding it has a potential OCI situation must submit, and have approved, a mitigation plan prior to engaging in any activities related to this acquisition. Since the approval process can be lengthy and approval of any plan is not assured, it is highly recommended that potential OCI identification and resolution processes begin in the pre-award phase as possible. An OCI may result in the canceling of an order or determining an Offeror to be ineligible for award. Firms should contact Bill Lyons at bill.lyons@hanscom.af.mil with any questions on this matter.</p>
<p>Contractors planning to attend Industry Day should provide the following Visitor Request information for those who will be attending:<br /><br />Full legal name<br />Organization<br />Citizenship Status<br /><br />To ensure timely processing and coordination with Aerospace, provide the above information no later thatn 12pm EST on October 17, 2012 to Mr. Bill Lyons via the email address below.<br /><br />One-on-ones will be held in the afternoon of&nbsp;October 25, 2012.&nbsp; For scheduling purposes please indicate in your initial submission whether or not you want to participate in one-on-ones and the number of people attending.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Contracting Office Address<br />Defense Logistics Agency, DLA Energy <br />8725 John J. Kingman Road, Suite 3830<br />Fort Belvoir, VA, 22060-6222<br />Description<br />The DLA Energy Energy Enterprise Business Unit seeks to identify and obtain information from responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the electric distribution system (NAICS 221122), natural gas distribution (221210), the water distribution system (NAICS 221310), and the wastewater collection system (NAICS 221320) at Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA), TX. Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity. The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system. Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. &sect;2688 - Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to assume ownership of the utility system(s) at Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA) and as the new system(s) owner shall operate and maintain the system(s) and provide utility services to the Government. Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility system(s).</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter "Notice") is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility. Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation. Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming. Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead no later than 3:00 pm EST on October, 3 2012. Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address: (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating electric, natural gas, water, or wastewater utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business). The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.</p>
<p>This Notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool. As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed. If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the November 2012 timeframe. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice. All information received will be considered. Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.</p>
<p>This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award. The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DLA Energy Contracting Office.</p>
<p>Installation Description</p>

Sam Houston, Lackland Air Force Base (AFB), and Randolph AFB by the formation of the 502nd Air Base Wing (ABW) as part of the Air Force Air Education and Training Command (AETC). On 24 July 2009 Air Force Brig. Gen. Len Patrick became the first commander of the 502nd ABW. Gen. Patrick's command has been established at Ft. Sam Houston.<br />JBSA is comprised of several Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) including the four main installations of: Ft. Sam Houston, Randolph AFB, Lackland AFB, and Lackland Training Annex. JBSA also includes the GSUs of Camp Bullis, Seguin Auxiliary Field, and Canyon Lake Recreation Areas.<br />JBSA consists of approximately 42,852 acres of land, 3,441 buildings and major facilities, and numerous smaller structures.

<DESC>This synopsis covers repairs of Flow Regulating Valves (NSN 4810-01-353-9209, P/N 2770073-114) and Valve Assemblies (NSN 4810-01-120-4699, P/N 2770073-113) and other items used to support the F-18 Aircraft and other Navy and FMS aircrafts. The sole source awardee of this BOA was Parker Hannifin (CAGE 59211). The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available is has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the government for these items have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
 If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the "http:// www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm" U.S Navy Aviation Supply Office Source Approval Information Brochure. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs

A significant change is the addition of a <strong><em>contractor guarantee component</em></strong>. The offeror will bid an annual fixed price to cover the costs of agents that are not available for replenishment through the National Prime Vendor as well as those that become residual to the contract upon completion. This fixed price from the offeror will include the risk for incurring all the costs for obtaining agents not replenishable from the National Prime Vendor and the disposition of residual inventory.</p>
<p>The feedback being requested should indicate whether the language concerning the guarantee is sufficiently descriptive and whether the objectives are apparent. Suggestions for controlling the guarantee's annual fixed price would be considered especially helpful. Any suggestions on language or program structure revisions within the intent of the language provided would be considered. Data referenced (i.e., mail order utilization, Managed Care Pricing File) in the sections revised will be provided with the final RFP. Prospective offerors are invited to comment on the sufficiency of this data in assessing potential cost/risk and proposing a premium at a fixed price. Any suggestions in this regard are welcomed. Limited distribution drugs not available from the National Prime Vendor will be excluded from the guarantee and will be treated as a network pharmacy claim.</p>
<p>The following, for reference only, is the original posting of the Draft RFP Elements, dated August 1, 2012.<br /><br /><strong>//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br /><br />INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) wishes to further develop its Pharmacy Program requirements in consideration of current capabilities of commercial pharmacy benefit management (PBM) organizations that provide Home Delivery/Mail Order pharmacy (including specialty pharmacy) services, retail pharmacy networks, claims adjudication, and fiscal intermediary functions on behalf of the Government to pay for all authorized pharmaceuticals and supplies dispensed to beneficiaries at retail pharmacies. TMA is seeking information from the pharmacy industry to enable inclusion of commercial best practices into the Government's objectives and requirements in a way that will encourage competition. Suggestions from industry will be considered; however, the Government reserves the right to solicit for the required services in a manner of its choosing in accordance with applicable procurement regulations.<br /><br />TMA is currently in the requirements definition and acquisition planning state for the follow-on to the current TRICARE Pharmacy Program contract, which is scheduled to conclude October 2014 if all options are exercised. Before proposals are formally solicited, TMA is releasing the draft Request for Proposal elements included in this Special Notice for industry comment. To facilitate meaningful input, TMA is concurrently providing potential offerors with certain historical data. Responses to this request for comment on these RFP elements are due by 4:00 PM on <strong>August 31, 2012</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></p>
<p>This Special Notice is issued for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. Information contained herein does not necessarily reflect all requirements to be found in any future solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to this Special Notice. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this Special Notice. All information received in response to this Special Notice that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the Special Notice will not be returned.</p>
<p>At this time, questions concerning this Special Notice or the exact composition and requirements of the intended, future Request for Proposals will not be entertained.</p>
<p>This posting constitutes the only draft of RFP elements that will be posted in advance of the formal RFP.</p>
<p><strong>TRICARE OVERVIEW</strong></p>
<p>The TRICARE Pharmacy Program falls under the Department of Defense (DoD) Military Health System (MHS) and TRICARE Program:</p>
<p>TRICARE is the health care program for approximately 9.6 million active duty and retired members of the Uniformed Services (the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Marine Corps, the U. S. Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service, and the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), their spouses and children, including TRICARE for Life beneficiaries entitled to Medicare Part A and Part B based on their age, disability and/or end-stage renal disease. Also eligible are Medal of Honor recipients. Military reservists (and their families) are also TRICARE beneficiaries, for the period during which they are on active duty, or if they choose to enroll to TRICARE Reserve Select or the TRICARE Retired Reserve program(s). More information about the TRICARE benefit may be found at http://www.tricare.mil/mybenefit/home/overview/Plans.</p>
<p>The MHS must be prepared not only to provide a high quality, cost-effective health care benefit to its eligible members during peacetime, but also must be prepared to support the armed forces during exercises, contingencies, operations other than war, and in wartime. The MHS provides quality medical care through: (1) a network of health care providers and pharmacies in the United States and its territories and (2) direct care Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) (hospitals, health and dental clinics) in the Continental United States and overseas. While the number and size of direct care facilities has declined in recent years, it remains important that MTFs are optimized in order to maintain the clinical skills of military clinical staff to support medical readiness. The direct care system cannot fully support the total demand for health care services; therefore, TRICARE uses the direct care system as the main delivery system and, through contracts, augments the direct care system through a civilian network of providers and facilities serving its eligible members.</p>
<p><strong>TRICARE PHARMACY BENEFITS PROGRAM</strong></p>
<p>TRICARE provides a world-class pharmacy benefit to all eligible beneficiaries through the integration of state of the art technologies to enhance patient safety, efficiency, and cost effectiveness. DoD administers an integrated TRICARE Pharmacy Benefits Program offering pharmacy services through direct care pharmacy services at MTFs located at various military bases, retail network pharmacies, authorized retail non-network pharmacies, or delivery through the TRICARE Home Delivery/Mail Order Pharmacy (TMOP). Retail pharmacy services are available in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>Features of the pharmacy benefits program include the use of the DoD Uniform Formulary, a tiered cost sharing structure, and a preference for generic over branded products. The DoD formulary lists the pharmaceutical agents, by therapeutic classes, that are authorized as basic program benefits. Prescriptions for selected pharmaceutical agents may be subject to prior authorization or utilization review requirements to assure medical necessity, clinical appropriateness, and/or cost effectiveness. DoD has established tiered cost-sharing by which beneficiaries partially defray costs of administering the pharmacy benefits program. Cost-sharing amounts that a beneficiary pays for each prescription will differ based on the classification of a pharmaceutical agent as generic, formulary, or non-formulary, in conjunction with the point of service from which the agent is acquired.</p>
<p>See 32 CFR 199.21 and Chapter 55 of Title 10 USC Section 1074g for additional information. Additional information is also available on the TRICARE Management Activity website at http://www.tricare.mil/tma/default.aspx. Extensive information on TRICARE Operations, Policy, Reimbursement, and Systems may be found in the system of manuals located at http://manuals.tricare.osd.mil.</p>
<p><strong>REQUEST FOR COMMENT - RFP ELEMENTS</strong></p>
<p>This request for comment follows on to earlier Request for Information (RFI) postings and provides draft sections of a contemplated formal solicitation. TMA is seeking information and recommendations from industry that will improve its approach to a future TRICARE pharmacy benefit management service contract that will support the MHS. TMA wishes to take advantage of the expertise of the industry and incorporate best practices and appropriate incentives to ensure the sustained quality of these practices. In promoting these purposes, TMA is providing descriptive data in an effort to remove barriers to competition. Your feedback is sought on the structure of this prospective program and the adequacy of its description. Please remember there are statutory and regulatory limitations, so TMA may not be able to implement recommendations conflicting with these limitations. However, administrative practices which support a more efficient TRICARE Pharmacy Program may be acceptable within these limitations and your presentation of information concerning such practices is welcomed. Comments are being sought at this time on the following elements of the contemplated formal solicitation. Responders are asked to key their comments to specific paragraphs/sections in the documents where appropriate. The elements are included as file attachments to this Special Notice:</p>
<p><strong>RFP SECTIONS<br /></strong>1. DRAFT RFP Section B (July 30, 2012) <br />2. DRAFT RFP Section C (July 31, 2012)<br />3. DRAFT RFP Section F (July 27, 2012)<br />4. DRAFT RFP Section H (July 31, 2012)<br />5. DRAFT RFP Section L (July 31, 2012)</p>
<p>In addition, an initial set of historical data and other information is being provided with this Special Notice in order for potential respondents to gain a better appreciation of the scope of the contemplated contract activity and to allow for more meaningful responses. It is expected that additional data will be made available from time to time as it is developed during the course of this acquisition.</p>

<DESC>The Department of the Army, Healthcare Acquisition Activity- North intends to negotiate three Sole Source commercial item procurements for  Multiple Amputation Trauma Trainers for Ramstein AFB in Germany, Yokota Japan, and two for Wright Patterson AFB. This procurement will  include liquid blood, Needle D Skin Plugs, Cric Skin, Manubrium Skin Plugs and training.  This proposed procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than October 10th, 2012  noon local time. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Point of contact Michele Devine, Contract Specialist, e-mail: michele.g.devine.ctr@us.army.mil <br><br>The following verbiage is directly from the Justification and Approval for sole source and is posted in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6).<br><br><br>K Force Government Solutions Inc., is the only vendor in the commercial market that offers this product. It was researched and developed under the Severe Trauma Simulation Army Technology Objective (ATO), TraumaFX was engineered specifically to meet the rigorous requirements of military and civilian training needs. Jointly developed with the U.S. Army RDECOM-ARL-STTC, TraumaFX MATT leverages in-depth human factors requirements analyses of military and civilian training needs to deliver powerfully realistic, yet easy to use training solutions that can be deployed to any location and operated in nearly any weather condition. <br>There is no other simulator on the market that provides this realistic, rugged, remote-control, tetherless training scenario complete with animatronics and special effects. Unlike other trainers, it can be worn by human actors and is compatible with other anthropomorphic trainers. The MATT has packable wounds, multiple tourniquet points, interchangeable priapism and scrotal avulsion and an upper torso that allows a multitude of procedures.  The animatronics give a degree of control to the instructor to advance a training scenario.  Students will learn how to find lifelike anatomical landmarks to execute critical patient treatment without relying on marked indicators. The sole source will avoid duplication of costs that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or the unacceptable delays due to the government.  The purchase of any other unit would reduce the training that the MATT is able to provide. <br><br>

<p>8. Tax-Payer ID.<br /><br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br /><br />1.0 BACKROUND</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates thirteen (13) HC144A aircraft manufactured by EADS CASA North America Inc. and nine (9) HU25 aircraft manufactured by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel. The HU25 aircraft fleet is scheduled for decommission in 2014 and will be replaced by HC144A aircraft. These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HC144A and HU25 missions frequently operate in salt laden environments. The EROS Full Face Quick Donning Oxygen Mask P/N MF20-514 and Mask P/N MF10-03-02 are installed in HU25 and HC144A aircraft and are manufactured by INTERTECHNIQUE (the OEM), Plaisir, France. The Oxygen Mask Serial Number (S/N) is tracked under the Coast Guard Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS). This tracking system provides a history record of repair, overhaul, maintenance, item location and status.</p>
<p>2.0 OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>2.1 The U.S. Coast Guard objective is to obtain the services of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center to REPAIR and OVERHAUL HC144A and HU25 Oxygen Masks and provide complete Ready for Issue (RFI) condition components.</p>
<p>2.2 Repair and Overhaul of Oxygen Masks shall include the sub-assembly which includes Regulator Assemblies RMC Series, Dust Covers and Hoses. The U.S. Coast Guard has placed all Oxygen Mask parts on condition to be replaced as necessary with the exception of Regulator Assembly RMC Series. Regulator Assemblies require overhaul every six (6) years.</p>
<p>The U. S. Coast Guard anticipates two (2) levels of service, Level I - REPAIR and Level II - OVERHAUL. The offeror may propose additional levels of repair, if any. The offeror is responsible for functions to perform the services requested. This includes, but not limited to, manuals, tools, fixtures, test equipment, materials, parts, engineering services, management, maintenance, preservation, packaging and shipping as necessary to Repair and Overhaul the HC144A and HU25 Oxygen Masks and sub-assemblies. In addition, Oxygen Mask sub-assembly Dust Cover P/N 59447-00 shall be installed on Hose P/N DTS Series for both Repair and Overhaul levels of service.</p>
<p>The offerors responsibilities to U.S. Coast Guard consist of ensuring the significant component history corresponds with the component, and that all OEM Service Bulletins and U.S. Coast Guard TCTOs remain incorporated upon completion of work.</p>
<p>2.2.1 Level I - REPAIR: Is considered as test/inspect/return to service as necessary. This work consists on inspection, failure analysis, defective part(s) replacement if necessary, and test to meet the OEM functional return to service requirements. Repair does not zero the Time Since Overhaul (TSO), component time continues for Oxygen Masks repaired.</p>
<p>2.2.2 Level II - OVERHAUL: Is considered over and above Level I - Repair scope and will consist of complete teardown, inspection, rework, assembly, and testing of components to OEM original or overhaul specifications. Overhaul includes as required, the incorporation of applicable Service Bulletins, modifications, configuration changes, and the replacement parts as necessary to satisfy OEM restoration interval and life cycle limited requirements. This work will include Regulator Assembly RMC Series having reached the "High Time" OEM restoration interval of six (6) years. Overhaul zeros the component Time since Overhaul (TSO), effectively restarts restoration intervals and OEM component life cycle limits, if applicable.</p>
<p>2.3 The offeror shall have access to current Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Component Maintenance Manuals (CMM), revisions, Service Bulletins, modifications, amendments and drawings. The U.S. Coast Guard does not own, nor can it provide this data.</p>
<p>2.3.1 The offeror shall identify and provide a list of the current status of all OEM CMMs, revisions, Service Bulletins, modifications, amendments, and other specifications applicable to the Repair and Overhaul U.S. Coast Guard HC144A and HU25 Oxygen Masks and sub-assemblies.</p>
<p>2.4 All Repaired and Overhauled HC144A and HU25 Oxygen Masks shall be returned to service Ready for Issue (RFI) condition with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Form 8130-3 or Certificate of Conformance (COC). FAA Form 8130-3 is preferred.</p>

Submit a written request to:<br /><br />Commanding Officer<br />Attn: ALC FOIA Officer<br />United States Coast Guard<br />Aviation Logistics Center<br />Elizabeth City, NC 27909<br /><br />4.0 SERVICE BULLETINS<br /><br />All service bulletins if not previously accomplished, shall be identified to the Contracting Officer. The contractor is responsible for obtaining service bulletins. Upon receipt of an oxygen mask requiring incorporation of such service bulletins, the contractor shall prepare a firm-fixed-price proposal IAW instructions listed below. Service bulletins created and incorporated during performance of this requirement may create new part number configurations, which supersede the previous configuration. In cases where the old configuration cannot be modified to the new, the new part number shall be added to the contract, by written modification. The contractor shall notify and request disposition instructions from the Contracting Officer for superseded parts, which have been removed and replaced by new part number configurations.<br /><br />Upon receipt of notification from the Contracting Officer that a service bulletin is required, the Contractor shall submit, within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the notification, a firm-fixed-price proposal for an incremental charge to be assessed each time the service bulletin is incorporated in a component. The proposal shall contain a breakdown of material and labor costs including hours, labor categories, labor rates, and applicable mark ups. The incremental charge agreed to for incorporation of a service bulletin shall apply only to those components into which the Contractor incorporates a required service bulletin, not those into which the service bulletin has been previously incorporated. Upon agreement of an incremental charge and issuance of a contract modification to reflect this change, the service bulletin shall be incorporated into each subsequent component received at the repair facility if said service bulletin has not already been incorporated. When service bulletin incorporation changes the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) part number, the new part number shall be added to the Contract, by written modification. The same procedures apply if removal of service bulletins is required.<br /><br />5.0 GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY<br /><br />5.1 P/N MF20-514, MASK OXYGEN-FULL FACE<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P/N MF10-03-02 MASK OXYGEN</p>

<p>1. Customer's name, address, and telephone number of both the lead contractual and technical personnel most familiar with the Offerors performance record. <br />2. Contract number, type, and total original and present or final contract value. <br />3. Date of contract, place(s) of performance, and delivery dates or period of performance<br />4. Brief description of contract work and comparability to the proposed effort. It is not sufficient to state that it is comparable in magnitude and scope. Rationale must be provided to demonstrate that it is comparable.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Price<br /><br />The U.S. Coast Guard may determine the best value that merits a higher price based on technical superiority. The U.S. Coast Guard, using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal's relative capability as measured against the evaluation factors. <br />Factors 1 and 2 are equal and are significantly more important than Factor 3. While the Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Price Factors are significantly more important than the Price Factor. Price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical factors and past performance factors approach equal.<br /><br />52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certification - Commercial Items (MAR 2012) ALT 1 (APR 2012) <br /><br />An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov.

<DESC>NOTICE OF SOLE SOURCE AWARD - CONTRACT # FA4418-13-P-0022<br />(In accordance with FAR 6.305)
<p><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of a sole source award under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1: Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br /><br />The Reference Number is FA4418-13-P-0022. The 628th Contracting Squadron, 101 E. Hill Blvd., Charleston AFB SC, awarded a contract for tobacco quit line to The American Lung Association (ALA) of Springfield, IL 62711-6226. Market research and information gathered determined this company to be the only source for this requirement.</p>
<p>The Justification for the Sole Source Award is as follows:<br /><br />In accordance with FAR 6.303-2:<br />(1) Agency and Activity: 628 Contracting Squadron, Joint Base Charleston, SC.<br /><br />(2) Nature of the action being approved: Sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>(3) The purpose of this acquisition is to renew the tobacco quit line service.</p>
<p>(4) Justification Rationale: IAW FAR 6.302-1(a)(2): Only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work.</p>
<p>(5) Demonstration of Unique Qualifications: The American Lung Association (ALA) Quit Line is a toll-free smoking cessation number distributed by the Health and Wellness Center (HAWC) to counsel Air Force personnel who desire to stop smoking. Each caller receives individualized tobacco cessation information and a free packet of materials outlining the smoking cessation process and recommendations from a Tobacco Cessation Specialist made based upon the individual's nicotine consumption.</p>
<p>(6) Description of Solicitation Efforts: GSA Advantage and SAM were queried for alternative sources, however none are able to meet the Government's requirement. IAW FAR 5.201, this sole source notice will be posted on the Government-wide Point of Entry (FedBizOpps).</p>
<p>(7) The contracting officer has determined that the anticipated price to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on comparison of similar medical phone help services.</p>
<p>(8) Description of market research: A search of GSA schedules and open market sources yielded no sources able to provide this particular service.</p>
<p>(9) Other supporting facts: 35 Air Force Bases are currently utilizing the ALA Quit Line services. The American Lung Association is a proven provider with great success at Joint Base Charleston and maintaining a continuity of service is necessary to the continued success of the program. Discontinuing the ALA services would have an adverse effect on the tobacco users' success of quitting which negatively impacts the Joint Base Charleston Fit to Fight program objectives.</p>
<p>(10) Interested Sources: Market research indicates this service is provided only by the American Lung Association.</p>
<p>(11) Actions to prevent barriers that may lead to restricted consideration in the future: Continue to survey the market for tobacco quit line services.</p>
<p>(12) This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

<DESC>This requirement is for all personnel, storage, materials, supplies, vehicles, equipment, fuel, licenses, permits, authorizations, certifications, insurance, services, and maintenance required to perform transportation functions in accordance with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations. This task order will provide daily fixed route shuttle services for employees of the following DHS Components located in the Washington, DC metropolitan area: Headquarters, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Transportation Security Administration, and the United States Coast Guard. The anticipated period of performance is September 29, 2012 through February 1, 2013.
<p><br />The contractor, RHG Group, performed transportation services of the type described above under DHS task order HSHQDC-12-J-00048, which expired September 28, 2012.&nbsp;DHS is in the process of conducting a procurement under FAR Subpart 8.4 to recompete these services and establish a minimum of two Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) to support employee transportation needs on a Department-wide basis. The BPAs are set aside for firms qualifying as small businesses under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 485999. The projected timeframe for the award of these BPAs is early to mid-November, 2012. DHS expects that Components will require at least two months to issue calls against these BPAs and transition the transportation services from the incumbent contractor to the BPA awardee(s).</p>
<p>The DHS Office of Security mandates specific security requirements ensuring protection of DHS personnel and facilities. The vendor is required to provide suitable personnel and comply with highly specified physical security requirements. The contractor's employees must be on-boarded through the DHS security suitability process prior to performing work, which can take from a few weeks to a few months. The contractor must also meet minimum vehicle storage requirements prescribed by the DHS Office of Security. The storage security requirements are necessary to ensure passenger safety and would likely require the contractor to make costly and time consuming modifications to its current vehicle storage facility to ensure adherence to these specifications. Therefore, DHS is not in a position to conduct a competition for interim transportation services for a four month period without such a competition resulting in a service disruption to a critical service.</p>
<p>DHS determined that RHG Group is the only firm that can effectively provide continuous transportation services, on an interim basis, while a transportation contract is recompeted for the purpose of establishing new BPAs.</p>
<p>The incumbent, RHG Group, possesses specialized experience, capabilities, and capacities specific to DHS's needs necessary to continue to provide transportation services without a break in service. RHG Group currently possesses the physical security systems, mandated by the DHS Office of Security, in order to comply with requirements for protection of DHS personnel and facilities. Any new contractor would need to hire and train new employees and obtain the required security credentials and physical security capabilities and capacities.</p>

<DESC>DHS has identified the use of Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) - 12 Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Cards, or smart cards, as the solution for securing the Department's information technology systems, networks, data, and applications. This requirement is to complete the solution's back end infrastructure to allow for DHS wide HSPD-12 card issuance and enable logical access to protect DHS IT assets from cyber breaches.
<p>In order to meet the above objective, DHS must obtain products and services relating to the DHS Identity Management System (IDMS). Specifically, DHS requires maintenance for the DHS IDMS Enrollment/Issuance Workstation (EIWS) interface to allow for the deployment of 75 non-XTec EIWS, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates for 300,000 user identities, Smart Card minidriver software, and On Line Certificate Statue Protocol (OCSP) software. The anticipated period of performance is 09/30/2012 through 02/14/2013.</p>
<p>In September of 2009, DHS/OPO contracted with XTec, Inc. through a GSA FSS DHS BPA (HSHQDC-08-A-00004) to accomplish the initial standup of a DHS capability for HSPD-12. This included the construction of enterprise infrastructure components, primarily the IDMS, as well as card issuance services for the Department.</p>
<p>The IDMS is the most critical enterprise service for the HSPD-12 program. All EIWS, which encode and print HSPD-12 PIV Cards, must connect to the IDMS for the purposes of PIV card enrollment and card issuance. At the time of the award for HSPD-12 infrastructure standup (and to date) no open standard existed for the interface of an IDMS with an EIWS for the purpose of HSPD-12 PIV Card issuance. In Fiscal Year 2011, XTec, Inc. developed an EIWS interface to allow for use of the DHS IDMS with non-XTec provided EIWS hardware.</p>
<p>The continued utilization of the DHS IDMS is critical to key HSPD-12 functions throughout DHS, to include employee PIV card issuance and the enabling of logical access. Only one source, XTec, Inc. is capable of performing the services under the unique or specialized circumstances of these services due to its status as developer of the DHS IDMS solution. The IDMS is an XTec proprietary product. For a third party to make modifications to the functionality and/or data standards of the XTec's IDMS/Card Management System (CMS) that supports XTec designed products for these services would require access to XTec's source code. Additionally, if XTec's source code were to be provided to a third party, it would still require XTec to make changes to the IDMS/CMS backend. As such, XTec is in the unique position to provide DHS a complete solution for full IDMS implementation.</p>

Such support will provide continuous real-time capacity for ASPE to provide quick-turnaround analyses and long-term research projects. The project supports ASPE's strategic research agenda related to policy analyses, a key component which is monitoring and evaluation of Medicare and Medicaid reform efforts. These tasks require analyses of the most recent Medicare and Medicaid claims databases as well as other administrative databases available through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services (CMS). Acumen shall update and expand the analyses based on the most recent available data. The databases will be current using the most recent available data for FYs 2013, 2014, and 2015 for Medicare payment systems and include the most recent data available (which may vary by state) for Medicaid. This requires the collection and analysis of the most updated data to refresh our modeling capacity and monitor impacts relative to baseline data and findings. The data set, analyses, and models will require adjustments in order to be responsive to future Secretarial requests.

<ARCHDATE>11232012
<DESC>Description of Action:  

The proposed sole source action is for the procurement of 50 annual term licenses for the Reasonable Accommodations Compliance System (RACS) supporting VA Central Office, Human Resources and Administration (HRA).  The procurement is proposed to be awarded as a firm-fixed price delivery order under the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) GS-35F-0240P to MicroPact Engineering Inc. (MicroPact).

Description of Supplies or Services:  
 
Entellitrak is the only software that, without major modification, can meet the need required by this contract. The software components were programmed as such to have adaptability to future requirements, or to changes in laws and regulations, without the need for program changes to the source code. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has established specific guidance for the processing of requests for accommodation. This guidance includes annual reporting to the EEOC. It is the only software which fully supports this EEOC guidance and reporting requirement. Further, it is the only known software that meets Section 508 accessibility requirements, as described in the Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Section 508 requires that all IT be accessible to people who have disabilities. Most of the 508 specifications are for making IT accessible for people who are blind or have low vision. 508 also requires that any software the VA acquires be compatible with the assistive IT that is already being used by VA employees with disabilities. MicroPact is the developer of Entellitrak software and has not authorized the software to be sold through any other sources outside of their company.

Authority:  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) entitled, "Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized." 

Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  

Entellitrak is the only software that, without major modification, can meet the need required by this contract.  The software components were programmed as such to have adaptability to future requirements, or to changes in laws and regulations, without the need for program changes to the source code. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has established specific guidance for the processing of requests for accommodation.  This guidance includes annual reporting to the EEOC.  It is the only software which fully supports this EEOC guidance and reporting requirement.  Further, it is the only known software that  meets Section 508 accessibility requirements, as described in the Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Section 508 requires that all IT be accessible to people who have disabilities.  Most of the 508 specifications are for making IT accessible for people who are blind or have low vision.  508 also requires that any software the VA acquires be compatible with the assistive IT that is already being used by VA employees with disabilities.  MicroPact is the developer of Entellitrak software and has not authorized the software to be sold through any other sources outside of their company. VA currently uses licenses acquired from MicroPact.  The licenses were used to test whether the module could provide the required output within RACS. The tests confirmed the Entellitrak software satisfies VA's need. The research found no other available solution that would enable compatibility within the existing RACS architecture without extensive modification and further refinement to the existing system. 
Based on this market research, the Government's technical experts determined that only Entellitrak software can meet all of VA's needs.
