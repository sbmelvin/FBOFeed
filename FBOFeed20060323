<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA)/ Department of Homeland Security (DHS) currently intends to enter a contract with Orange County Sheriff’s Range, Orlando, FL for a firearms range with the following requirements: 

 The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 611699.  Services anticipated beginning April 1, 2006 and will continue for 12 months thereafter.  The contract will also contain 4 option periods to be exercised as a unilateral right of the Government.

The range shall be located within a 20-minute commute from the Orlando International Airport.  Commute time will be assessed in consideration of prime rush hour traffic, both in the morning and late afternoon/early evening.

DHS will provide all AMMUNITION, TARGETS, FIREARMS INSTRUCTORS.  The range time must be available exclusively to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during the hours indicated.  The range must be closed to the public during the corresponding hours and the hours for use should be scheduled.  The range may be indoor or outdoor.  The range must possess a minimum of 25 firing points and must be able to accommodate a qualification course distance minimum of 1.5 yards and a maximum of 25 yards.  The range shall possess adequate exterior lighting in both public and work areas.  The range shall possess drinking fountains located near the range facilities for DHS use.  The range shall be equipped with men and women’s restroom facilities with running water located near the range facilities for DHS use.  The range shall provide sufficient trash receptacles for used targets, target backings, and empty ammunition boxes.  The range shall be equipped for removal of used brass cartridges.  The range shall provide adequate on-site parking to accommodate 25 vehicles.  The range must posses an on-site classroom facility with chalkboard or dry erase board, computer, and overhead projector and seating to accommodate 25 students.  The range must be able to accommodate the following calibers:  9mm, .40, .45, .357, .223, and .308 caliber ammunition.  The range shall possess rifle and shotgun capabilities with a minimum distance of 200 yards.  The range must allow movement between firing points and shall not restrict movement-oriented firearms training by students (i.e. standing to kneeling transitions).  The range rules shall allow shooters to draw and fire from the holster.  The range rules cannot disallow a student from moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present, (i.e. tactical move and shoot type drills where instructor/student ratio would be too restrictive).  The range shall possess a cleaning area complete with air hose and solvent tank.    

DHS personnel will use the range an average of 25 days semi-annually with approximately 300,000 rounds to be shot annually.  The contractor will be paid per the actual number of days used not to exceed the total available per year.  DHS will schedule minimum 90 days in advance.  This range must be closed or concealed from the public during the corresponding hours.  Under this contract, DHS requires exclusive use of the range from 0800-1200 hours.  This does not include weekends or holidays.  Should weather (i.e. rain) or unforeseen circumstances prevent the use of the range, DHS will reschedule those missed days within the same month, if possible, or the following month if not possible.  

Note:  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals, as the Government has determined that there is no other range facility that meets the requirements set forth above.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Questions concerning this intent can be e-mailed to: Doretta.F.Chiarlone@secureskies.net or  faxed to number (609) 813-3446.  The date and time of closing is Tuesday, March 28, 2006, 5:00pm EST (Eastern Standard Time).

<CONTACT>Aaron Ford, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-254-6375, Fax 202-254-5398, Email Aaron.Ford1@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate, Office of Systems Engineering and Development, BioWatch Program has a requirement for the Center for Infectious Research and Policy—University of Minnesota (CIDRAP) to direct a series of public health, medical, and epidemiological activities for the BioWatch Program.  This effort will be accomplished through the issuance of a sole-source, Firm Fixed Price contract to the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy--University of Minnesota, C315 Mayo Memorial Building, MMC 263, 420 Delaware Street SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455.  This sole-source contract is being done under the statutory authority of  41 United States Code 253 (c)(1)—only one responsible source.  CIDRAP, through their exhaustive knowledge of the BioWatch Program and their strong (over 20 years) relationships they possess with state and local public health officials/practitioners, offers a unique capability that is not otherwise available to the Government and is the only qualified source to perform this effort within the timeframe to meet the BioWatch program needs.  As an academic research organization, CIDRAP occupies a unique niche that permits CIDRAP to act effectively as an intermediary between the Federal Government (i.e. the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Homeland Security) and state and local public health organizations.   The efforts described herein cannot be performed by any other source, without substantial and unrecoverable schedule slippage that represents an unacceptable programmatic risk.  The primary objectives of this contract are as follows:  (1) Promote communication to and between epidemiologists in BioWatch jurisdictions (at the state and local levels); (2) Increase signal interpretation and response planning capabilities at the state and local levels; and (3) Increase coordination of Federal and local interpretation activities and resources.  The specific activities that CIDRAP will perform to achieve the above referenced objectives include the following:  Activity 1-- BioWatch Epidemiology Workgroup—CIDRAP will utilize their public health background and existing relationships with epidemiologists and other public health staff to direct activities for the national BioWatch Epidemiology Workgroup (BWEW).  CIDRAP will identify gaps, assess and prioritize public health-related issues, provide recommendations, and determine priorities for discussion with the BWEW.  CIDRAP will initiate and lead topic-based discussions with local, state, regional, and Federal epidemiologists, as well as DHS, CDC, FBI, EPA and the national laboratory staff, as appropriate.  Issues will be summarized and presented to the BWEW for their discussion, comment, and final recommendations.  CIDRAP will initiate appropriate follow-up activities in conjunction with other BioWatch partners to implement these recommendations as part of a national public health action plan.  Activity 2—CIDRAP will provide direction for the BioWatch Epidemiology Network (BWEN)--This network will inform BioWatch epidemiologists across the United States about new and upcoming public health activities.  The “key contact” network of BioWatch epidemiologists will be consulted regarding implementation of new or revised programmatic areas of BioWatch.  Comments and recommendations from this network will be considered and included, as appropriate, by CIDRAP in the national public health action plan.  Activity 3—Regional BioWatch Meetings--CIDRAP will develop the goals and objectives for a series of eight regional meetings (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest 1 and 2, Texas, California, West and National Capital Region).  CIDRAP will discuss the meeting agenda’s with the DHS management.  The multidisciplinary BioWatch participants will be invited to the meeting objectives and goals.  The regional meetings will include updates on new and ongoing BioWatch activities, discussions about local, regional, and national issues, and provide an opportunity to provide additional training or exercises for jurisdiction staff.  CIDRAP will facilitate these discussions and assist regions with identifying areas of agreement/disagreement and planning for resolution of these issues.  The meetings may utilize a variety of formats, including presentations, video, discussions, and small group breakouts, as needed, to advance regional response planning efforts.  Regional issues will be documented by CIDRAP and incorporated into a national action plan for BioWatch public health efforts, as appropriate.  Activity 4--BioWatch Guidance Document --CIDRAP will direct the development and implementation efforts to update, revise, and develop additional content areas for the overall BioWatch Guidance Document.  CIDRAP will prioritize the guidance document development; direct the discussion and consensus building efforts necessary to implement these changes; and document issues and resolutions about future efforts.  Consensus building is a major aspect of this development effort.  CIDRAP will consult with local, state, and Federal epidemiologists in public health as well as DHS, CDC, FBI, EPA, and the national laboratory staff to ensure that the guidance will characterize the respective agency requirements.  CIDRAP will direct the guidance documents discussion in both the BWEW and the Environmental Sampling Workgroups.  CIDRAP will direct the discussion and development process for environmental sampling guidance through the BioWatch Environmental Sampling Group (BWESW).  Activity 5—Veterinary Surveillance Summarization--CIDRAP will conduct a veterinary surveillance project to determine the occurrence and distribution of naturally occurring zoonotic diseases in the geographic areas surrounding the BioWatch jurisdictions.  Activity 6—Attend and Participate in DHS and Federal Agency Requested Meetings--CIDRAP will attend and participate in meetings as requested by DHS and other Federal agencies involved with the BioWatch public health medical/epidemiological efforts.     The anticipated period of performance for this contract will be 5 years (a one-year base period and four one-year options).  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541690 and the applicable size standard is $6.5 Million.  There is no pre-solicitation conference planned for this requirement.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.    NO SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED FOR THIS REQUIREMENT.  This requirement will NOT be set-aside for small business concerns.  Inquiries regarding the availability of subcontracting opportunities should be directed to the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy—University of Minnesota (CIDRAP).  Any questions concerning this notice should be directed to the Contracting Officer via email at Aaron.Ford1@dhs.gov.  Number Notes 22 and 26 apply to this action.

After award of the initial contracts, the three successful offerors will compete for task orders based on using one of these three processes:  Best Value to the Government using trade off processes, or Low Price, or  Low Price Technically Acceptable. The Government will provide full plans and specifications for each task order or detailed shop drawings and a statement of work. The estimated dollar range of task orders to be issued is $25,000 - $3,000,000. The work will consist of General Construction  projects falling under NAICS Code Sectors 236, 237, and 238, with emphasis on work in 238 sector.  The size standards are $31,000,000 for NAICS 236 and 237 and $13,000,000 for NAICS code 238.  Contractors who certify themselves as small businesses must be small businesses in each of the NAICS codes.
The Government reserves the right to award one of the contracts to a qualified 8(a) firm, 
provided an acceptable proposal is submitted, price and technical factors considered. The remaining two contracts will be made to the firms considered to be the Best Value and will be competed UNRESTRICTED.  If sufficient qualified 8(a) firms apply and are considered “Best Value”, it is possible that more than one contract will be awarded to 8(a) firms.  We will utilize two-step, Source Selection Procedures for this procurement. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and the use of a trade-off process when it may be in the best interest of the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror(s) or other than the highest technically rated offeror(s).  Phase 1 of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to select approximately five – seven offerors based on factors that include:  Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Scheduling, and Small Business Subcontracting Effort.  Phase I factors relate to the base year and each of the three option year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects including administrative, training, family housing, dormitory, and community support type facilities, not just the seed project identified in Section 00202 of the RFP.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit additional information on Factor B (Technical) pertinent to the seed project and price proposals for that project.  IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE FULL SOLICITATION WILL BE POSTED IN APPROXIMATELY 30-45 DAYS AND WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD AT THE NAVFAC WEBSITE, URL ADDRESS:  WWW.ESOL.NAVFAC.NAVY.MIL

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A  PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.   The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisition Center (COAC) for the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) intends to negotiate and award  a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Illumina Inc., 9885 Towne Centre, San Diego, CA., 92121. The purchase consists of 864 Micro array bundles, each of which can analyze 1536 SNP loci from a single sample.  These 1536 loci span more than 130 addiction-related genes.  Each bundle consists of sufficient arrays, reagents, and custom oligonucleotides for a single DNA sample.  The sole source determination is based upon the chips interrogation of more than 130 genes simultaneously and will provide full haplotype information for all of these genes. In addition it has 168 Ancestry Informative markers that will allow the lab to control for population stratification within the lab’s populations.  Use of another platform would require the government to validate all of the assays on that platform prior to carrying out the analysis, and this would not be cost saving to the government. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541710 and the Size Standard 500 employee.  The acquisition is being conducted  under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of  FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Government is planning to award to Government Micro Resources, Inc. (GMRI), a small business reseller of LinuxNetwork equipment, located in Manassas, VA,  for the procurement of 64 additional processors for an existing LinuxNetworx  computer. The existing hardware, currently in use by the warheads development  team, does not have the capacity to support all of the high fidelity modeling  required by numerous Army programs now, and into the future.  LinuxNetworx  however, has built in scalability into their hardware and provided the  opportunity to not only extend the lifespan of existing hardware, but to  increase its functionality and capability through the addition of processors.   Since this brand of machine has already been purchased and is currently in use,  the least expensive solution for the government would be to add more processors  to the existing LinuxNetworx computer.

REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE

DELIVERY AND INSTALLATION OF CONTRACT LINE ITEMS 0001 – 0030 IS TO BE COMPLETELY  OPERATIONALLLY BY 1 JUNE 2006.

The Government will evaluate equally, as regards time of delivery, offers that propose delivery of each quantity within the applicable delivery period specified above. Offers that propose delivery that will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. The Government reserves the right to award under either the required delivery schedule or the proposed delivery schedule, when an offeror offers an earlier delivery schedule than required above. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the required delivery schedule above will apply.

The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor’s date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding
(1)	five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or
(2)	one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term “working day” excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source contract to Anteon Corporation, 3211 Jermantown Road, Fairfax, Virginia 22030-2844 for the acquisition of thirty-six (36) AN/AQS-24 Container Upgrade Kits.  The AN/AQS-14A system is in the process of being upgraded to the AN/AQS-24 system via engineering change proposal (ECP) 143.  This upgrade will include a complete overhaul of the aircraft mounted components, the in-water components, and all necessary support equipment.   Therefore the shipping containers require modifications to correlate with the change in equipment.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.

The Anteon Corporation, the original equipment manufacturer of the containers, has developed an upgrade kit (Q-24 Container Upgrade;  P/N:  8Y603-2006241).  This kit !  will provide the necessary modifications to upgrade the current containers to be used by the fleet for the AN/AQS-24.  The Government does not own the drawings for the upgrade kit.  Therefore these upgrade kits are being acquired from Anteon Corporation.  FSC Code is 8145, NAICS Code is  541330, small business standard is $4.5M.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

McChord AFB is seeking potential small business sources for the bare rental of cranes that meet all the salient characteristics listed in this advertisement.  This rental will be by a Blanket Purchase Agreement, description below.

Respondents are asked to provide their documents to A1C Rebecca L. Maxwell by fax at 253-982-3656 or via email at rebecca.maxwell@mcchord.af.mil by 4:30pm PST on 29 March 2006.

STATEMENT OF WORK FOR BARE RENTAL CRANE SERVICES

1.0. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES.  The contractor shall provide crane rental services to the 62d Maintenance Squadron.  

2.0. EQUIPMENT SPECIFICATIONS.  The contractor shall provide a fully hydraulic, self-propelled, wheeled base crane.  Crane must have a variable boom length with a minimum of 21 ft extension (full power), 85% of tipping on outriggers, 75% of tipping on rubber, single axis controls, and is capable of moving load on rubber.  Crane must be capable of lifting up to at least 3000 lbs with sling and hook height ranging from 0-55 feet (device used must interface with all components and/or slings which have a 3 inch minimum inside clear opening) with at least a 38 foot radius.  Lift device must have load moment indicator safety feature.

2.1.  SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. The contractor’s equipment shall comply with all appropriate safety requirements to meet OSHA, state, and local industry standards.
	
3.0. DURATION OF LEASE.  Duration of rental, per call, shall not exceed 60 days.

3.1. DELIVERY.  The contractor shall provide delivery of the crane directly to the jobsite on McChord AFB specified by 62d MXS within 24 hrs from the time of request.  Once the crane is delivered, it will be operated by certified and licensed government personnel.

DESCRIPTION OF A BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (BPA) for Crane Rental

1.  The 62 Contracting Squadron on behalf of the 62 MXS would like to initiate a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for occasional crane rentals.
  
2. A BPA is similar to a commercial charge account.  It is a simplified method of filling anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing “charge accounts” with qualified sources of supply.  The authorized government individuals place calls and make payments with their Visa Government Purchase Card (GPC).  A BPA is an agreement only, not a contract, between your organization and the government.  Terms and conditions of the agreement are established in advance, which govern future purchases (if any) made against the BPA.  The Government is only obligated to the extent of authorized calls actually placed against the BPA and your firm is not obligated to perform in response to a call placed against the BPA.  Either party may cancel the BPA with written notice at any time 

3. If your firm wishes to participate, please provide the following information electronically, not later than 29 March 2006:
-	Firm-fixed price listing of various daily, weekly and monthly crane rental rates, that meets the minimum requirements specified in the attached Statement of Work
-	Firm-fixed price quotes for pick-up and delivery charge
-	Any special offers such as government discounts and special weekend/holiday rates
	
4.  If you have any questions, please contact A1C Rebecca Maxwell at 253-982-3887 or email at rebecca.maxwell@mcchord.af.mil

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Patuxent River, MD is seeking information for potential sources for information regarding industry technologies applicable to monitor pilot state for the ultimate goal of detecting and/or preventing hypoxia. This request is for INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. 

CURRENT KNOWLEDGE:     There is a risk of hypoxia (lack of oxygen) associated with high altitude flight, exposures to +Gz-stress, and high mountain operations.  Hypoxia can cause breathing difficulty, mental confusion, poor judgment, loss of muscle coordination, dizziness, fatigue, visual impairment, nausea, tingling, numbness, and unconsciousness. These symptoms also occur in spatial disorientation and Almost Loss of Consciousness (A-LOC) episodes. The insidious nature of hypoxia is such that the onset of symptoms is often unrecognized until it is too late. This can result in loss of situational awareness, may impact mission success, and has led to aircraft mishaps when loss of consciousness occurred. A complicating factor is that there are wide individual differences in tolerance to acute and chronic exposures to reduced oxygen environments.  

Hypoxia is an issue in both military and civilian air and land (e.g. Afghanistan) environments. Hypoxia related mishaps occur even at relatively low altitudes (three recent incidents ranged from 3,000 to 10,000 feet above ground level).  For high flying aircraft hypoxia can occur due to mechanical problems, such as cabin pressurization failure or failure of the oxygen system.  The oxygen breathing gas itself may have been contaminated. Current technology allows monitoring of aircraft oxygen system pressures and purity (i.e. percent oxygen concentration) on the aircraft.  However, failure of the oxygen mask or other component downstream of the aircraft’s oxygen purity sensing equipment may go undetected and can result in pilot hypoxia from lower purity oxygen being delivered at the pilot’s mask.  Actual oxygen purity concentration in the oxygen mask (i.e. being delivered to the pilot) cannot currently be monitored due to the bulk and weight of existing oxygen sensing technology.  Other indices of the pilot’s physiological state, such as carbon dioxide production, breathing rate, blood oxygen saturation, etc., are not currently monitored because of a shortfall in existing miniaturized sensors and physiological models.  

POTENTIAL NEEDS:     Due to the insidious nature of hypoxia there is a potential need for better equipment and person mounted pilot state monitoring. Such a system should be independent of the aircraft and in a portable configuration thus allowing for non-aviation applications (i.e. high altitude mountainous terrain operations by ground forces).  The system should monitor oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, workload, breathing rate (possible hyperventilation) and temperature through the use of noninvasive miniaturized sensors. These data should be incorporated into a physiologic model that can detect hypoxia and predict and provide a warning of the onset of symptoms.  Research and testing (human testing to be performed by NAWCAD) would be required to optimize the sensing and warning package into a robust and affordable system that is applicable to air and mountain operations. 

PURPOSE:     The Government is interested in written submittals of concepts and rough-order-of magnitude (ROM) cost estimates.  Product samples and 3-D models are highly encouraged.  Additionally, the Government is interested in any commercial off the shelf (COTS) products or non-developmental items (NDI) that could be modified to meet these needs.  Applicants must:  1.)  Demonstrate an extensive knowledge of hypoxia and its effects.  2.) Have the capability to produce and/or acquire non-invasive miniaturized sensors capable of monitoring oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, workload, breathing rate (possible hyperventilation) and temperature, preferably in a wireless manner.  System should consider both man-mounted and equipment mounted alternatives.  3.) Have the capability to produce a physiologic model for input of collected data, for prediction, detection, and prevention of hypoxia. 

Interested parties will be evaluated as they are received to determine the following merit criteria; (a) technical and scientific merit; (b) offer’s ability to demonstrate/execute feasibility; (c) offer’s existing capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of the above that will enable the vendor to achieve the intended objective; (d) ability to demonstrate and execute cost savings alternatives.  

INFORMATION AND MATERIALS REQUIRED:     Interested parties are invited to submit no more than a ten (10) page written abstract of concepts, technology, capabilities and experience, and rough-order-of-magnitude cost estimates for the above.  In addition, respondents must clarify if their firm can provide COTS or NDI that could be modified, or the technology and expertise for development to meet NAWCAD’s needs.  Furthermore, samples and 3-D models are encouraged.   

Submittal Information:     This IS NOT a Request For Proposal (RFP) nor does the Government intend to pay for any information or items in response to this synopsis.  This synopsis does not commit the Government to award any future contracts.  Companies responding to this Request For Information (RFI) should provide detailed information as stated in the “Information and Materials Required” section to DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND, AIRCRAFT SUPPORT CONTRACT DEPARTMENT (AIR 2.5.1.3.2), ATTN: MS. JULIE BLEW, AIR CODE 2.5.1.3.2.2, 21983 BUNDY ROAD UNIT 7 BLDG. 441, PATUXENT RIVER, MARYLAND  20670-1127.  Written responses should be submitted no later than 24 April 2006 and reference this synopsis number on both the mailing envelope as well as on all enclosed documents.  In addition, respondents interested should indicate whether or not they are a small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), or large business.  Please address all technical questions to Dr. Barry Shender, Code 4.6.5.6, (301) 342-8881.  Proprietary information MUST be marked as such, on a page-by-page basis.   This announcement is NOT a Request For Proposal nor does the Government intend to pay for any information/items submitted in response to this synopsis.  Data, samples and 3-D models WILL NOT be returned.  This synopsis does not commit the Government to award a contract.  This synopsis is for market research only and any procurement resulting from this announcement will be published separately on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBiz Ops) website.

<SUBJECT>D -- Sources Sought for telephone system maintenance for NARA
<SOLNBR>NAMA-06-Q-0019
<RESPDATE>041406
<ARCHDATE>04292006
<CONTACT>Santo Plater, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-837-2059, Fax 301-837-3227, Email santo.plater@nara.gov - Santo Plater, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-837-2059, Fax 301-837-3227, Email santo.plater@nara.gov
<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is seeking information and capabilities statements from responsible small and large business, in accordance with FAR 15.201(e)--Exchanges with Industry before Receipt of Proposals, for a nationwide service contract to maintain its administration wide telephone system.  The current system ties all NARA sites into a unified, private communications network, which integrates computer telephony applications at the user’s desktop.  These applications include voice, email, fax, video and LANs.  There are currently 38 NARA sites some have more than one PBX in a campus environment.  All use a model 1500 as a Gateway interface to NARA’s frame relay network.

The contractor would be required to provide all management, personnel, equipment, transportation, supervision, training, installation and support necessary to maintain the telephone system for NARA  With response being defined as accessing the affected system either remotely or onsite and reporting preliminary findings to NARA, the vendor would be responsible for responding to major interruptions in service within 2 hours of notification and within 4 hours of notification for minor interruptions.  The vendor should have the ability to support the current Siemens product line and new product line offerings that NARA may incorporate into its network.  Current product line components include Hicom and Hipath PBXs; Xpressions voice mail, Compact voice mail, ProCenter ACD, Optipoint and Optisets, Telident 911 System.  The vendor would need the ability to ensure that all PBX, Xpressions voice mail and ProCenter ACD applications have the current software and hardware updates.  The vendor would also be required to have the ability to support IP telephony and toll bypass applications using NARA’s current frame relay and point-to-point data network.  The telephone system uses cat 5 or better for wire runs to the desktop.  The vendor should have the ability to run cat 5 and fiber cable to support the system when required.  The NARA telephone system connects all NARA sites via our frame relay network provided by Sprint.  Each site has two PBX units, one for voice services and a smaller 3500 to interface with the frame relay network.  The vendor must be familiar with frame relay, point-to-point and meshed networks.  Two Siemens Xpressions (version 4.0) servers provide voice mail.  One server is resident at NARA’s St. Louis facility and the second is located at Archives II in College Park, MD.  The St Louis system serves locations west of the Mississippi River and the College Park system serves locations east of the Mississippi River.  NARA would also need a national Help Desk accessible from 7 AM EST time until 7 PM PST.  The vendor would need to ensure that all equipment (furnished as spare or as repair parts) in connection with the repair of Siemens labeled equipment, are new, standard parts manufactured by the equipment manufacturer.  Replacement parts for non-Siemens components such as computers may be OEM products.  All parts, furnished as spares or repair parts, would be required to be guaranteed and/or warranted for a period of 30 days after installation.

The anticipated requirement is for one-year base period with four one-year option periods.  The Contractor would need to be able to accommodate a phase-in plan as new facilities are likely to come on line during the term of this contract and the vendor will become responsible for maintenance services once all manufacturer warranties expire.  As these warranties end, NARA would expect the vendor to incorporate the facility into its nationwide activities.  The following locations comprise the NARA Nationwide Network.  Formatting for postings creates some difficulty with information displayed herein.  For ease of interpretation cut and paste the sections between the asterisks (****).

SOW Follows:
  
FARM SERVICE AGENCY
STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)

REQUEST FOR ONLINE MARKETING SERVICES
FOR CCC-OWNED GRAINS

Section 1.0	General Information

1.1	Background:
The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) proposes to contract for online marketing services of CCC-owned grain.  CCC’s definition of grain for purposes of this solicitation includes wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, rice, and soybeans.  The online marketing service would supplement the current CCC sales methods of cataloging, issuing public invitations, and providing sales lists for grain.  The statutory authority of Section 5 of the CCC Charter Act provides that, “In the Corporation’s purchasing and selling operations with respect to agricultural commodities, the Corporation shall, to the maximum extent practicable consistent with the fulfillment of the Corporations purposes and the effective and efficient conducts of its business, utilize the usual and customary channels, facilities, and arrangements of trade and commerce, including, at the option of the Corporation, the use of private sector entities.”  Furthermore, P.L. 104-127, Section 165 states, in part, “… The Commodity Credit Corporation may sell any commodity owned or controlled by the Corporation at any price that the Secretary determines will maximize returns to the Corporation.”

CCC currently sells cotton and peanuts obtained through marketing assistance loan program forfeitures.  CCC sold 108,247 bales of cotton valued at $36.03 million in fiscal year 2004, and 17,616 bales valued at $4.07 million in fiscal year 2005.  In March 2006, CCC completed sales of 105,811 tons of 2004-crop peanuts valued at $31.73 million.

1.2	Objectives:

CCC’s objectives are to obtain competitive prices for grain inventories in the most cost-effective and least disruptive market manner.
 
Section 2.0	Statement of Work

2.1	Requirements:
CCC proposes to use online marketing services for sales of its own grain inventories.  The service provider must demonstrate to CCC’s satisfaction their previous experience with online marketing of 1 or more agricultural commodities, and meet the qualifications in Section 4.0.  Online marketing services will offer customers the opportunity to negotiate commodity prices, complete sales transactions and, as applicable, complete transfer of title in an electronic format.

The online marketing service contract will cover CCC-owned grain and be in place for a 12-month period.  CCC will have options to extend the contract for an additional four (4) 12 month periods. The Government is not obligated to exercise any Option Period. If CCC exercises this option, CCC will have a second, third, and fourth extension option for an additional 12 months, to provide for a total contract period of 60 months.  
The online marketing service must provide:  Online access to CCC personnel normally engaged in the merchandizing of grain; Help desk assistance to the users; Inventory sales data in an electronic format; and summary data on actual sales activities.

The online marketing services must include CCC-owned grain along with other industry owners/marketers of these commodities.  Generally, bids on government-owned commodities are somewhat lower than bids on privately owned commodities.  Making CCC-owned grain available on a private industry online marketing services website would eliminate the identification of the commodity as government-owned, which may result in higher bids.  The use of online marketing services will leverage market driven “best in class” technology, and use market forces in a fair and equitable manner to maximize returns to CCC.

2.2	Quality Assurances:
CCC will use the following guidelines to measure vendor performance:

1.	Grain inventory placed on the service will be made available for sale within 4 hours of receipt by the vendor.

2.	The vendor will have the marketing service available at least 8 hours a day during normal business hours (8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. central time).

3.	All daily sales transactions will be finalized, including payment to CCC, no later than 9:00 a.m. on the next business day.

4.	Sales and inventory data will be provided to CCC on a daily basis, as soon as possible after close of business each day (and not later than 9:00 a.m. on the next business day).

5.	The vendor will ensure that the integrity of the system is maintained at all times.  Market positions, sales information, and inventory positions shall be restricted to authorized representatives of the vendor and CCC.

Section 3.0	Requirements/Tasks
The contractor shall provide the following services:

3.1	The contractor shall establish a marketing service for grain, available through the internet as an online and electronic function.

3.2	The contractor shall conduct online sales in a dynamic bidding system.  CCC shall maintain title to the commodity until confirmation of cash is received via wire transfer or electronic funds transfer (EFT), unless the vendor guarantees the sale.  If sale is guaranteed, CCC shall not be subject to losses incurred due to the failure of any subsequent transaction.  CCC may place grain on the online marketing service, or remove grain from the online marketing service, at CCC’s sole discretion, at anytime throughout the contract term.

3.3	The contractor shall protect both the buyer’s and seller’s identity.  Until a sale is confirmed, the price determining process shall be anonymous.

3.4	The contractor shall provide necessary security safeguards to ensure that market sensitive or proprietary data is secure from disclosure.

3.5	The contractor shall ensure that its users of online marketing services are entities actively engaged in merchandising commodities.

3.6	The contractor shall generate necessary inventory sales data to interface with CCC’s inventory systems.  See Section 10.0.

Section 4.0	Deliverables
4.1	Remote access to online marketing service for Bulk Commodities Division, Kansas City Commodity Office, and Warehouse and Inventory Division, Washington, DC.

4.2	Electronic interface requirements to make grain inventories available on online marketing service provided to Kansas City Commodity Office.

Section 6.0	Contractor Furnished Items

Section 7.0	Basis of Award
The award will be made using “Best Value” Selection Process.  The Technical Team will evaluate all proposals to identify all contractors whose proposals may be the best value to the government, price and other factors considered, in accordance with the SOW and the evaluation criteria set forth below.  Evaluation will be made using 4 evaluation criteria – (1) Technical Ability, (2) Past Performance, (3) Live Demonstration, (4) Price.  Evaluation of factors:  The combined Non-Price Related factors/experience are more important than Price.

The best value determination will be made after the live test demonstrations.

<DESC>This serves as a sources sought notice and market survey to locate qualified businesses capable of providing specialized shipping containers. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has a requirement for shipping containers to ship meat, poultry and egg products test samples to FSIS laboratories in St. Louis, MO, Athens, GA and Alameda, CA. The test samples are required under the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Inspection Act, and the Egg Products Inspection Act. The Government anticipates using an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract for the period of one base year with four one year option periods. The shipping containers shall meet the following specifications. INTERIOR DIMENSION REQUIREMENTS: very small - the inside of the container must provide a 7.5" x 7.5" x 3" space for sample material; small - the inside of the container must provide a 7.75" x 7.75" x 4.5" space for sample material; large - the inside of the container must provide a 13" x 9" x 8" space for sample material. The shipping containers shall meet the program requirements for both frozen and refrigerated samples. The shipping containers shall be a semi-disposable item. The inner components shall be durable to last a minimum of ten (10) round trips from the plant to the laboratory and return. The shipping containers shall provide leakage control of the sample contained within, in the event of secondary containment failure. The very small and small container shall be no more than five (5) pounds total weight. The large container shall be no more than ten (10) pounds total weight. The containers shall incorporate replaceable component parts to facilitate longevity of the container and support cost efficiency of the sampling program. The very small and small container shall be self sealing using a velcro type closure. The large container shall be sealed with sealing tape. The containers must have a method/component in place to limit movement of the sample held in the box to prevent rupture, breakage, and leakage (i.e. a plug or top). No fire retardant is to be used in any of the materials or components of the shipping containers. Must be able to stack the very small and small container at least six (6) units high without collapsing or crushing the contents. The large container must be able to stack four (4) units high without collapsing or crushing the contents. The sealing material must adhere properly to the surface of the container. See Directive 7355.1 pages 6 & 7. 
http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OPPDE/rdad/FSISDirectives/7355.1Rev2.pdf 
The containers must be relatively easy to pack and unpack by FSIS employees with minimal time and effort. Specifications for components: CORRUGATED BOX OVER WRAP-#200 bursting strength, single wall, c-flute, custom USDA printing; CLOSURE-plug, saw cut flexible polyurethane, 2 mil plastic, laminated to one face; ABSORBENT PAD-cellulose tissue, plastic on one side; REFRIGERANT PACK-one 24 oz polar type hard pack for the very small and small container, two 24 oz polar type hard pack for the large container; POLYURETHANE CONTAINER-CFC free, rigid polyurethane, 2.0 lbs/cu/ft density, wall thickness 1" for very small container, wall thickness 1 ½" for small and large container; SPACER PAD-#200 bursting strength, double wall B/C flute; LINER-thermoform low density polyethylene. No materials that contain polybrominated dipehenyl ethers can be used in any of the components of the containers. TEMPERATURE CONTROL REQUIREMENTS: The method or product used must be leak proof, durable and reusable. Dry ice cannot be used as a standard method but occasionally the container will be shipped with dry ice. The surface of the sample shipping container will be subjected for a twenty (20) hour period to an integrated temperature of 87 degrees Fahrenheit. For frozen samples, the hamburger is placed in the container at a temperature less than 32 degrees Fahrenheit, and the surface temperature of the hamburger may not exceed 32 degrees Fahrenheit at any time, based upon the conditions above (20 hour period at an integrated temperature of 87 degrees Fahrenheit). For refrigerated samples, the hamburger is placed in the containers at a uniform 34 degrees Fahrenheit, and the hamburger surface temperature may neither fall below 32 degrees Fahrenheit nor exceed 50 degrees Fahrenheit at any time, based upon the conditions above. EXTERIOR SURFACE REQUIREMENTS: The outside of each container must contain the following: The capability to affix a clear plastic pouch for an air bill that is 9.25" x 10.5" and our current container seal material form 7355.1 2A. MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS: The outside of the container must not be slick or waxed. The outer container must be removable to allow replacement/recycling after four (4) round trips. However, the container must protect the samples and other contents of the container. The containers shall meet the EPA’s recommendations for the use of recycled content paper/structural fiberboard, and laminated paperboard. The containers must be easily stackable, and must allow for ease of opening and sealing. The containers shall meet all U.S. Department of Transportation shipping requirements as well as those of the Federal Government contractor for overnight package deliveries. USE OF THE CONTAINERS: The samples which are shipped from plants throughout the United States, to the laboratories in St. Louis, MO, Athens, GA and Alameda, Ca, include tissues from beef, swine, or poultry, such as muscles, liver, or kidney, and meat and poultry products such as hotdogs and chicken pot pies. Other samples matrices include liquid and dry eggs, urine, blood, sponges soaked in broth, and rinses from animal carcasses. Neither regulated hazardous waste nor concentrated pathogens are transported using these containers. Generally, one to three pounds of sample is shipped in the very small container, six to nine pounds in the small container, and up to ten to fifteen pounds in the large container. Some samples are frozen at the plants to 32 degrees Fahrenheit before being shipped. Most microbiology samples cannot be frozen, so they generally are shipped from the plant at 34 degrees Fahrenheit with a gel pack frozen to 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Additional information on shipping container usage at FSIS can be viewed at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OPPDE/rdad/FSISDirectives/7355.1Rev2.pdf

<DESC>Request For Information/Sources Sought Notice for
Emergency Energy Bars/Paste Prototype

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, REQUEST FOR QUOTES, 
OR INVITATION FOR BIDS. THIS IS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. 

The Department of Agriculture (USDA), Farm Service Agency (FSA), Kansas City Commodity Office (KCCO), is issuing this Request For Information/Sources Sought Notice for the purpose of market research only and is in no way obligated to purchase any commodity as a result of this inquiry.  Parties responding to this Request For Information do so voluntarily and without the expectation of remuneration from the Government. 

Introduction

USDA, FSA, KCCO is conducting market research into the feasibility of the vendor community to produce, package, and deliver to the U.S. Government, at a reasonable cost, emergency energy bars and emergency energy paste.  Product specifications are provided in this document.  KCCO seeks information from the vendor community as to its interest in and capability to manufacture these products. 

Background

USDA, FSA, KCCO procures various commodities on behalf of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for use in foreign food assistance programs.  These programs are intended, among other things, to provide nutritional assistance to at-risk individuals affected by natural and man-made disasters. A considerable portion of the commodities procured are staple foods such as whole grains, dry edible peas, beans and lentils, vegetable oil, and milled rice. However, a part of the mission of these foreign food assistance programs encompasses providing nutritional help to those individuals who are so compromised nutritionally that traditional staple foods are difficult to prepare and consume. In an effort to develop innovative approaches to feeding this segment of recipients of foreign food aid, USAID, in conjunction with the U.S. Army and USDA, has developed an emergency food ration in the form of dry bars and packeted paste.  

Objective

The intent of this RFI is to gather information about the interest and capability of the vendor community to manufacture these products and the estimated cost to deliver the products to the Government. Responses to this RFI will assist KCCO and USAID in deciding whether or not to proceed with periodic procurements of these products. At the present time, it is estimated that with sufficient vendor interest and reasonable pricing, there may be procurement activity of no more than 300 metric tons per year.

Vendors are asked to review the commodity and packaging specifications and advise:

1. If they have the technical equipment, facilities, and manufacturing capability to produce these products; 
2. What Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) sampling and testing procedures would be instituted to assure quality and uniformity of the products;
3. The amount of time needed to be in a position to commence production;
4. What quantities could be produced over what period of time; and 
5. An estimated cost for both the dry bars and the packeted paste for a given quantity.


NOTE:  Package markings may be different than those in the attached documents and may include USAID brand markings.

Vendors shall submit information by e-mail to karen.barnard@kcc.usda.gov not later than May 23, 2006.

<SUBJECT>F -- Stewardship Workshop for Contractors
<DESC>News Release

The Eldorado National Forest will be hosting a workshop on reducing forest fuels using Stewardship Contracting.  The target audience is prospective contractors who wish to learn more about how stewardship contracts work and how to bid.  Stewardship contracts allow the Forest Service to exchange goods for services, and were authorized by Congress in the 2003 Appropriations Bill. 

For the past 2 years, the Eldorado National Forest has been using the value of commercial timber from forest thinning to offset the cost of machine piling and chipping surface and ladder fuels.  “Stewardship Contracts reduce the Forest Service’s reliance on tax dollars to accomplish vital fuels reduction in our forests, increasing the amount of work we can accomplish and shortening the time it takes to complete a project” according to Patricia Ferrell, Eldorado National Forest Contracting Officer. “We have completed some very successful projects that include piling the debris on the forest floor and thinning out the smaller trees to reduce the risk of a wildfire killing the larger trees and spreading to communities”.  Fuels reduction isn’t the only work that can be done using stewardship contracts. Watershed restoration, wildlife habitat improvement, forest health, and noxious weed control projects are but a few of the kinds of work that can be accomplished.  

“Stewardship contracting is another tool we have to achieve our land management objectives and provides a lot of advantages,” said Ms. Ferrell.  “But, like anything new, there is apprehension.  We plan to help educate our prospective contractors so they can effectively bid on these projects.”  The workshop will include a tour of the recently completed Sun Dawg project near Georgetown, and the new Rockeye project in the Mosquito area.  The workshop will begin at 9:00 a.m., Friday, March 31, at the Georgetown Ranger Station, 7600 Wentworth Springs Road, Georgetown.  For more information contact Patricia Ferrell, Eldorado National Forest Contracting Officer, 530-642-5146.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY BIOBRIEFCASE – A PORTABLE INSTRUMENT FOR AUTONOMOUS DETECTION OF BIOAGENTS
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
BIOBRIEFCASE – A PORTABLE INSTRUMENT FOR 
AUTONOMOUS DETECTION OF BIOAGENTS


Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to commercialize LLNL's portable autonomous bioagent detection system – BioBriefcase.

Background: There is a critical need for distributed biothreat agent sensor networks that can operate in civilian applications. These platforms need to have several key properties: 1) they need to be capable of detecting pathogens within a 1 to 2 hours, allowing for enough time to respond to an event; 2) they need to be extremely low cost to maintain, since continuous monitoring is essential for many applications; and 3) they need to have sufficient sensitivity to cover a broad geographical area and have sufficient selectivity to virtually eliminate false positives. Currently available bio-weapons detection systems are designed primarily for military use. These military systems are expensive to deploy and ultimately unsuited for civilian protection. 

Description:	LLNL’s BioBriefcase is a compact and portable instrument capable of autonomously detecting the full spectrum of bioagents, including bacteria, viruses and toxins in the air.  It uses the state of art technologies to collect, process, and analyze samples to detect, and identify genetic and protein signatures of bioagents.  

Advantages:  The compacted size does not compromise the performance. The BioBriefcase features rapid response, multiplex capability, small reagent consumption, relatively low cost, with high sensitivity and short response time.  

Potential Applications:  It is an ideal instrument for monitoring bioagents in the environment, such as in open space, inside a building or in a transit system when quick and accurate detection is required.  It is also a useful tool for defense, first responders, homeland security applications, agriculture, or environmental monitoring in factories or buildings.  A simple redesign may convert it to a bench top instrument for medical diagnosis and scientific research with autonomous sampling and processing of biological samples for simultaneously measuring or identifying specific DNA/RNA or protein signatures.

Development Status:  LLNL has filed multiple patent applications to protect the BioBriefcase technologies.  The patent applications cover several unique inventions in sample collection, concentration, processing and amplification, and data analysis.

LLNL is seeking one or more industry partners to commercialize BioBriefcase through licensing LLNL’s BioBriefcase intellectual property portfolio and funding cooperative research to further develop the instrument.  Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  
Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's BioBriefcase technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
P.O. Box 808, L-795
Livermore, CA  94551-0808
Attention:  FBO 126-06

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's BioBriefcase technology.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS, IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI.  NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED PUR SUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.   1.  SUBJECT:  The Air Force Medical Evaluation Support Activity (AFMESA) is conducting market research to review potential vendors of medical dictation/transcription voice and speech recognition technologies that potentially meet Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) requirements.  This market research may also assist with the further development and/or refinement of AFMS requirements.  Responses are due to this RFI by 4:00 PM on 3 April 2006.  See section 5.0 for further information. 2.0 DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI.  Responses to this notice are no t offers and will not be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  At this time, questions concerning the composition and requirements for a future request for proposal, as well as those regarding the nature of the services to be performed under the medi cal dictation/transcription initiative will not be entertained. 3.0 DESCRIPTION:  The AFMS has a validated requirement to reduce the costs associated with medical dictation and transcription, and improve the delivery of health-care services, by implementing technologies that will free up time for providers to deliver p atient care rather than document patient encounters. 4.0 REQUIREMENTS:  The medical dictation/transcription system must be able to operate in the Military Health System (MHS), DoD and AF common operating environments.  It must automatically convert speech into text at up to 160 words per minute with a word a ccuracy rate of 90% or higher and allow the voice control of software applications simply by speaking.  The medical dictation/transcription system must have a medical dictionary/terminology lexicon that supports AFMS medical specialties.  This capability i s needed to transform the generation of patient-care notes, reports, letters and other documents utilizing front-end and/or back-end integration.  It must allow providers and healthcare personnel to dictate on-the-go using a variety of input methods (i.e.,  telephone, PCs, tablets, digital voice recorders), establish a network infrastructure to facilitate user access to transcription data and posses a reasonable system of redundancy for continuity of information.  It will create a Macro library of standard r eport templates so that providers and health-care personnel can quickly and easily produce electronic medical records simply by speaking a few key words.  It will support a seamless speech-input capability that follows a defined dictation template that can  be converted to a HL 7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) with a minimal XML structure, and will be compatible with existing DoD and Veterans Administration electronic medical records (AHLTA and VISTA).  The Government encourages creativity and innovati on in responses to this RFI.  The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about commercially available products that meet the requirements enumerated above.   5.  RESPONSES TO THIS RFI MAY BE SENT BY MAIL OR EMAIL:  U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity ATTN: Rebecca Tama 820 Chandler Street Fort Detrick, MD 21702 OR Rebecca.Tama@amedd.army.mil

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the solicitation.  Solicitation number is H94003-06-T-0007 and the solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-07.  The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) intends to solicit and award a sole source, firm fixed price contract to MCI Telecommunications, Government Markets, 1945 Old Gallows Road, Vienna VA 22182-3931. This acquisition will provide local telephone services for DMEA.  The Contractor must be able to port DMEAs existing telephone numbers and any changes to DMEAs existing telephone numbers will be unacceptable.  The telephone numbers currently assigned are from the Sacramento Main Rate Center, whereas DMEA is actually located in the Sacramento North Rate Center.  At the time the telephone numbers were assigned FCC numbering rules allowed service providers to port telephone numbers across Rate Center boundaries.  Changes in FCC numbering rules after DMEAs numbers were assigned, mandated that service providers provide numbers assigned to their rate center.  However, telephone numbers currently assigned can continue to cross rate boundaries as long as the customer remains with their current service provider or a new service provider petitions the California Public Utilities Commission to maintain the telephone numbers.  The contractor must be able to port DMEAs existing telephone numbers and any changes to DMEAs existing telephone numbers will be unacceptable.  Set-aside: None; associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 517110; small business size standard:  1500 employees.  Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program: not applicable.  The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) rating is DO-S1.  The date and time offers are due: 04/07/06 10:00am Pacific time to DMEA, Contracting Office, 4234 54th Street, McClellan, CA 95652-2100.  Anticipated award date is 04/14/06.

Fob Point: Destination, McClellan, CA 95652.  STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) DMEA 06-6E0 for Local Telecommunication Service and Support Dated 16 March 2006.  1.0 SCOPE: Provide Local Telephone Service for DMEA as defined herein.  The objective of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to obtain local telephone communications service and support.  Included in the contract are provisions for the reuse of the existing PBX and if needed the purchase of, and interface between the PBX and new phone service line.  1.1 Background: Telephone service for DMEA employees and DMEA customers is a vital part of the engineering process.   Long distance is provided for under another DMEA contract and is not a part of this agreement.  1.2 Location: 4234 54th Street, McClellan, CA, 95652.  1.3 Additional Information: The NPA for DMEA is 916.  The present NXXs for DMEA are 231 and 414.  2.0 Definitions: The following definitions are given for the purpose of this contract:  demarc:  A demarc (an abbreviation for demarcation point) marks the point where communications facilities owned by one organization interface with that of another organization. In telephone terminology, this is the interface between customer-premises equipment and telecommunications service provider’s equipment.  A synonym is network terminating interface (NTI).  NPA: Numbering Plan Area (telephony, AKA: Area Code).  NXX: Network Numbering Exchange (in North American Numbering Plan) 3.0 Requirements:  3.1 Location: The telecommunication circuit shall be maintained at 4234 54th Street, McClellan, CA 95652.   The telecommunication communication circuit shall be retained in room 159.  Installation shall be accomplished so as to minimize downtime of DMEA’s telephone connection and service.  Additional work shall be performed at the contractor’s site as needed in support of this contract.  3.2 Current equipment and related information: At present, DMEA uses a PBX switch made by Tadiran. Local telephone service is provided over ISDN via PRI. Reuse of the existing PBX shall be a requirement of this contract.   DMEA uses an Adtran T1 CSU (Ace) as the interface between the phone company circuit and one PRI card installed in the Tadiran switch that accepts the PRI circuit (23 ISDN channels). We have a spare T1 card that was used with our previous T1 service.   DMEA calls go out from the lower ISDN channels up, and incoming calls come from the higher ISDN channels down. DMEA has never run out of open channels for our calling needs – usually many channels are idle. The number of channels shall not be reduced by this new contract.  3.3 Work to be performed: The contractor shall maintain all necessary hardware as required to provide the telephone communication service to DMEA. All costs associated with any required site changes will be determined and negotiated.  DMEA will approve requested changes within 5 business days.   Any additional non-recurring and recurring charges attributable to those alterations or modifications of the existing configuration shall unless directed by the Government be borne by the Contractor.  3.4 Security: The contractor is required to provide advance notification prior to conducting any on-site inspection, installation or maintenance.  A two (2) hour minimum notice during normal business hours shall be given.  In general, all installation and maintenance work will be performed by US citizens.  Exceptions to this can be made (1) if no US Citizen is capable of performing the work and (2) with the advance approval of the DMEA director.  Contractor personnel shall provide proof of citizenship in accordance with the DMEA visitor approval process in effect at the time the visit is requested and prior to being allowed entry into DMEA facilities.  During periods of exceptionally heightened security, additional advance notice and background investigations of contractor personnel may be required prior to gaining entry into DMEA. DMEA may at that time require additional minimum notice during normal business hours be given.  Exceptions to these requirements can only be made with approval of the DMEA director.  Exceptions generally require 5-10 working days advance notice.  3.5 Applicable standards: All preparations shall be in compliance with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Electronic Industries Association (EIA), National Electrical Code, and all state and local codes.  3.6 Acceptance criteria: The contractor shall develop and conduct an acceptance test that demonstrates to DMEA that all requirements of this contract have been met.  The initial acceptance test shall be conducted and successfully completed immediately after installation of the new telephone communication circuits.  3.7 Special requirements: The following special requirements apply to this contract:  3.7.1 The contractor shall use the existing PBX equipment and interface cards   DMEA shall own the equipment past the demarc.  3.7.2 The contractor shall be responsible for the maintenance and configuration of all equipment affected by this contract including but not limited to the telecommunications circuit interface.  3.7.3 The contractor shall ensure that DMEA has the continued use (number portability) of its existing phone numbers.

DMEA shall be informed within 15 minutes when the telecommunication circuit or service is down.  When problems are suspected, the contractor shall conduct all needed tests and diagnostics to determine the source of the problem and shall ensure corrective action is taken.  3.7.5 The use of a trouble tracking system shall be available to enable DMEA to track the status of reported or known problems.  Using this system, DMEA shall be notified of problems affecting the service by at least one and preferably at least two of the following methods: phone, fax, or email.  3.7.6 The contractor shall submit monthly invoices to the Government billing address shown on the applicable order by the 20th of the month following the month in which the charges occurred. All charges shall be billed in arrears. In addition to the information required in FAR 52.212-4(g), with the invoice, the following additional information shall also be included on all invoices:  • Billing period (dates) • Location of services • Complete telephone number assignments • Effective date(s) of charges • Sub and grand totals • Past due charges and/or credits • Summary of current charges including charges for local, flat rate or measured service and local long distance calling shall be detailed.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate (in accordance with FAR 6.302-1) with Gerber Coburn Optical Inc., 55 Gerber Road, South Windsor, CT 06074, as the only source who can provide Finer/Polisher Cylinder System.

The requirement is for a Finer/Polisher Cylinder System.  This system is a laboratory tool that generates accurate lenses by automatically selecting the best processing times and pressures in accordance with the specified lens material: CR39, polycarbonate, hi-index or glass. This degree of precision is supported by a mechanical design providing optimized fining and polishing orbits.  The system should have a fluid delivery system that provides increased clearance for lap and lens loading.  This should allow fast loading and unloading. It should increase coolant /slurry flow rates to increase productivity by reducing processing times and minimizing lens re-work.  It should have a feature that automatically clamps the laps and lenses in place when the cycle is engaged to speed cycle times.  It should have a display that is designed to guide operators through each step of the fining and polishing process.  It should be customized to accommodate each lab's needs. It should be easily calibrated.  The system should easily handle a wide curve range.  It should produce consistent results via a one-or two-step fining process (without stroke adjustments).  It should be ergonomically designed, fast and efficient.  It should have compact size and quiet operation.  Air requirements: 50 PSI (minimum), 125 PSI (maximum), 1 CFM.  This should also include all service and operator manuals.


EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD:   The technical factors, factors 1-4 below, combined are significantly more important than price, and are listed in descending order of importance. However, price may become a critical factor in the event that two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all technical factors.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and is being made in accordance with the test program for commercial items as authorized in Far Part 13.  

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND A SEPARATE WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  

This solicitation No., RFQ-NCI-60047-NG, includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-08 (January 2006).  

The North American Industry Classification Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

STATEMENT OF WORK: Measurement of Arsenic, Selenium, and Zinc in Toenail Samples from a Case-Control Study of Bladder Cancer in New England using Neutron Activation Analysis.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  Exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water is associated with elevated risk of several internal cancers, and in particular, bladder cancer.  The observation that bladder cancer risk is elevated subsequent to arsenic ingestion comes from studies in several populations worldwide, including Southwest Taiwan, Northeast Taiwan, Northern Chile, and Cordoba Province of Argentina.  These populations historically have been exposed to very high levels of arsenic in their drinking water, and dramatic risk elevations are observed, with relative risks ranging from 3 or 4 to 15, compared to populations with low levels of arsenic in their drinking water.  Exposures in these regions of the world ranged between 200 ug/L to 1500 ug/L.  
	
The National Cancer Institute, in collaboration with Dartmouth Medical School and several state Departments of Health, has completed the field work in a large case-control study of bladder cancer in Northern New England (Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire).  This study was motivated by the persistent elevated rates of bladder cancer mortality and incidence in these three states.  Reasons for this elevation are poorly understood.  

Arsenic in drinking water has emerged as a leading hypothesis that may explain the excess bladder cancer in New England.  Low- to moderate levels of arsenic in bedrock aquifers used for drinking water, especially in private wells, occur in extended parts of the region.   Based on what is known about the distribution of arsenic in Northern New England, and assuming a straight line extrapolation from the well-established risk of bladder cancer observed at high levels of exposure, the excess risk in rural areas appears to fit the expected level of risk.  However, to date there have been no reliable assessments of bladder cancer risk in populations exposed to the lower levels of arsenic in water that are found in New England, and evaluation of this is an important part of the design of the NCI epidemiologic study.   

PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROCUREMENT:  The main objective is to determine levels of arsenic, selenium, and zinc in toenail samples collected from subjects who participated in a case-control study of bladder cancer.  The data will be used to estimate exposure to these elements in the context of the case-control study.  

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor shall:	

1	Analyze samples for the presence and concentration of arsenic (As), selenium (Se), and Zinc (Zn) using nuclear activation analysis (NAA).  

2	Prepare all samples as necessary (routine analysis) prior to NAA analysis.  

3	Contractor shall specify whether cleaning of samples prior to analysis is included in the proposal.  If cleaning is included in the proposal, the cost shall be identified as a separately priced line item. 

4	In the case-control study, toenail samples were collected from 2,545 participants.  The weight of each sample is not yet available, and some samples may fall below the minimum required for adequate NAA analysis.  Under the assumption that all samples meet the minimum weight requirements for analysis, 2,545 sample analyses will be required.  In addition, 10% (255 samples) randomly selected samples of adequate size will be split and blindly submitted for quality assurance (QA) purposes.  Thus the maximum number of analyses, including QA samples will be 2,800.  All analyses must be completed, with results submitted, no later than eight (8) months after the start date of this contract.  Higher throughput, which would permit completion of analyses no later than six (6) months after contract initiation, will be to the advantage of the contracting laboratory.

The contractor shall provide a detailed description of quality control/quality assurance procedures that are used for preparation and analysis of blanks and standardized samples.  

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS: 

1	The Contractor shall electronically communicate results of all analyses, including quality control information, to the NCI Project Officer on a weekly basis, using an Excel format to be provided by NCI. Problems or delays relating to any aspect of these analyses shall be reported to the NCI Project Officer as soon as noted by the contractor. 

2	Contractor shall provide a summary report of progress, study management, problems, and their resolution, to NCI on a monthly basis, to commence the beginning of the first month after samples have been received by the contractor.  

3	The report shall include, but not be limited to: Counts of the numbers of samples received, analyzed, and whose results were reported in the monthly reporting period, as well as totals to date.  
		
4	The Contractor shall provide a final report to NCI at the conclusion of all analyses which shall include summaries of these same data.  

GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES: NCI will provide to the contractor toenail samples collected from study subjects in the period 2002-2005.  If cleaning of samples is not included in an offeror’s proposal, this will be done by the Government prior to shipment.   In addition to original samples, an additional 10% of the samples will be blinded replicates, indistinguishable from the original samples.  These blinded replicates will be submitted to the contractor for quality control purposes.

Samples will be shipped to the contractor from NCI's sample repository in batches to be determined by consultation and agreement between NCI and the contractor, and at a frequency to be determined in like manner.   Prior to shipment of samples from the NCI repository to the contractor, the batch size used in analysis will be communicated to NCI to permit the rational organization of QA samples.   The weight of each sample shipped from NCI shall be no less than 10 mg. 

INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:  Within two weeks of submission of data to NCI, the Project Officer will review the data submitted to NCI by the contractor, and inform the contractor of any anomalies found and/or corrective action required

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  May 1, 2006 – January 31, 2007.  NOTE:  Offerors may propose a shorter delivery schedule and will be given additional technical points if this shorter delivery schedule is proposed.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO QUOTERS:

BASIS FOR AWARD:  Award will be made, subject to available funding and quoter responsibility, to that acceptable quote, the price or cost of which is not necessarily the lowest, but which is sufficiently more advantageous to the Government than the lowest offer so as to justify the payment of additional amounts, based on the evaluation criteria described in this section.

<DESC>Amendment 08 Questions and Answers

..lease one E1 line from alternate telecommunication company to provide the Embassy with alternate routing capability..

Q1Does this mean that Last Mile Redundancy is not enough, and we should contract an E1 Line from our competitors ?
A1.No, we must have a redundancy for back up in case of a failure of your network or switch.

..LandLines/LeaseLines:
Run 12 pair Multifiber from demarcation point to Embassy Frame Room...

Q2. Does this mean that even though we as Telemovil already have a 12 Pair Monomode Fiber from demarcation point to Frame Room we are requested for a new F.O Cable ?  
A2. The Companies that have Fiber Optic runs up to the MDF will not need to run new fiber.  However, for growth Post would like estimates of new 12 pair multi-fiber runs.   

Q3. If this is the case since there is no more room in the conduits how should we implement this new cable? 
A3.Once the contract has been decided Post will work with individual companies on the solution.  Removing some of the copper wiring to make room may be one of the solutions.  

Q4. We will need a Survey to determine the cost of this implementation how can we coordinate this visit?
A4. There are no plans for any of the companies to have another site visit at this time.  

"...Lines should be routed to multiple central offices/switches for redundancy..."

Q5. Does this mean that we need 2 different Last Miles for this NEW F.O Cable ?
If this is the case we then need to install two 12 Pair Fiber Cables and 2 ODF's at US Embassy's Frame Room.
A5. No, what we are referring to is after the demarcation point the companies should have the capability to connect to different switches for redundancy purposes.

Data/Internet service
Bandwidth can be no less than 2048 Kbps

Q6 Does this mean that the Embassy requires Clear-Channel Bandwith to the Internet (CIR=100%)?
A6. No, this internet service will allow us to provide the bandwidth necessary for other agencies.   

DVC (Digital Video Conferencing) DVC service over Integrated Services Digital Network/Basic Rate Interface (ISDN/BRI) and Internet Protocol (IP) network with bandwidth capability of no less than 512 Kbps through Fiber Optic cable to the Embassy's MDF.

Q7. How many ISDN/BRI lines are required ? 
A7. 8

Q8. For IP Service, does this mean that the Embassy requires Clear-Channel Bandwith to the Internet (CIR=100%)?Is this IP Link going to be used for VideoConferencing Only ?
A8.  Yes, as close to 100% as possible.

Q9. Will satellite connectivity be acceptable for general connectivity? 
A9. No, terrestrial connectivity only.

Q10. Does the government require Continuity of Operations (COOP) capability for redundancy and survivability of telecommunications?  
A10. Yes, for true redundancy with two different communication providers.

Q11.Would satellite connectivity be an acceptable method of providing COOP-related telecommunications? 
A11. No, terrestrial connectivity only.

Q12. Can the government please provide  its current voice volume (minutes, routes) and data traffic levels, even a rough order of magnitude (ROM)?
A12. Not at this time. 

Q13. Can you please provide a pictorial schematic of connectivity so we can have a better understanding of all the distribution of the services inside the Embassy? 
A13. Not at this time.

Q14. Can you define if the service provider can make use of the present ducting that the embassy has, or if it will be necessary to make a new ducting for placing the services that you describe in the Amendment 06.
A14. At the time of award, Post will work with the individual companies, if infrastructure is already in place new ducting may not be necessary.   Removing some of the copper wiring to make room may be one of the solutions.  

Q15. Can you tell us the distance between the demarcation point and the Embassy Frame Room? 
A15. Approximately 350 meters.

Q16. Can you tell us the distance between the Embassy Frame Room and the multiple central offices in which the switches for redundancy are stored? 
A16. That would depend where the service provider has the central offices.

Q17. You offer to disposition 8 Multimode pairs of Optical Fiber that the provider can use to distribute the services. Can you tell us if this 8 pairs are still available for this purpose? 
A17. If referring to the fiber that would be installed between the demarcation point and the MDF, yes.

Q18. Can you tell if the 12 new pairs of Optical Fiber that you are requesting in Amendment  06  are exclusively for the switches for redundancy stored in the multiple central offices? 
A18. These lines may be used for growth, taking the services already in place from the demarcation point to MDF and possibly redundancy.

Q19. Can you approve a site survey to all service providers? We request this because we need to measure the cellular signal strength and ducting for the land lines. 
A19. There are no plans for any of the companies to have another site visit at this time.  
Cellular signal is not received inside the buildings. Land lines must be terminated at the demarcation point. Communication company will be responsible for getting lines from demarcation point to switch (one time service).

<DESC>Purpose of this modification is to provide the following information: 1.  Closing date is extended from 27 March at 1615 (4:15 p.m.) Central Time Zone to 30 March 2006 at 1615 (4:15 p.m.) Central Standard Time Zone. 2. Is it mandatory that 75% are in rooms that are double occupancy?  No, not mandatory.  That is, if Offeror can provide rooms for each officer individually at the most competitive price, the military would not mind this position.  Individual rooms at a co mpetitive price would be an advantage.   3. Does the military have any preferred locations; i.e., close to Houston, TX, near another military base?  Location must be in the San Antonio, Texas.  This is dictated by the class providers. 4. Should the training center be for exclusive use? Yes.  Classrooms, training facilities, and housing should be for exclusive use.  Dining facility may be shared with other groups. 5. Should the recreational facilities be for exclusive use? Yes.  This is due to the Army Physical Fitness Test, which eliminates distractions.  Time of test administration shall be 0430-0800 A.M.. During other times, recreational facilities may be shared with other groups. 6. Any confidential requirements; i.e., secure meeting space, limited access space, background checks on key personnel supporting this effort, etc.?  No confidentiality requirements as the course information is unclassified. 7.  Are you only accepting bids from companies who can provide all of the requirements or are you accepting bids from multiple companies to fulfill various needs of the solicitation?  We are accepting bids only from companies who can provide all of the req uirements. 8.  Could the Army consider utilizing a hotel or hotels to house the students and a separate convention center within walking distance for the classroom, training and other special requirements of the solicitation? Yes.  The requirement states that the cla ssrooms, training areas, and dining facility must be within a quarter mile distance of the lodging facility. 9.  Can we house the students in a hotel or multiple hotels and utilize a college auditorium and classrooms as well as their track and field area. Can this college facility be within a 5 mile radius? Hotel or hotels to house the students must be within wal king distance for the classroom, training and other special requirements of the solicitation? Must have all facilities within a quarter mile area to minimize travel time to and from the facilities.  The training schedule is very tight, we do not have trans portation assets, and if a student misses the bus, that would negatively impact the training. 10.  Can our proposal provide shuttles for the students based on what facilities they choose?  Hotel or hotels to house the students must be within walking distance for the classroom, training and other special requirements of the solicitation? Must have a ll facilities within a quarter mile area to minimize travel time to and from the facilities.  The training schedule is very tight, we do not have transportation assets, and if a student misses the bus, that would negatively impact the training. 11.  If the college requires insurance would the government be able to provide such documentation? The government is self-insured.  But if any facility is damaged due to government misuse/neglect, there is a system to appropriately pay for the damage. 12.  Are you flexible with the dates of 6/20-7/1/06? No.  These dates have been published by the course providers.  Dates for 2007 are 17-30 June 2007.  2008 dates are not known at this time.  The Captains Career Course does fall under the AMEDD Center an d School - AMEDD C&S.
