<DESC>The goal of the System F6 program is to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of disaggregated - or fractionated - space architectures, wherein the functionality traditionally co-resident within a single, large, monolithic satellite is delivered by a cluster of wirelessly-interconnected modules capable of sharing their resources and utilizing resources found elsewhere in the cluster. Such an architecture enhances the adaptability and survivability of space systems, while also shortening development timelines and reducing the barrier-to-entry for participation in the national security space industry. The program is predicated on the development of open interface standards - from the physical wireless link layer, through the network protocol stack, and including the real-time resource sharing middleware and cluster flight logic - that can enable the emergence of a space global commons which would enhance the mutual security posture of all participants through interdependence. A key program goal is the industry-wide promulgation of these open interface standards for the sustainment and development of future fractionated systems. For complete details of the BAA, see attachment - DARPA-BAA-11-01 System F6. The DARPA Program Office website for System F6 is located at: http://www.darpa.mil/tto/programs/systemf6/index.html.

<CONTACT>Kathy Sthill, 202-493-1408

<a href="mailto:kathy.sthill@faa.gov">kathy.sthill@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>In the past year, The National Airspace System (NAS) Voice System (NVS) Program Office received a number of Request for Information (RFI) responses from Industry regarding the NVS Reference Architecture, network management, transition, and the application of Working Group 67 (WG67) Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) Air Traffic Management (ATM) open standards. Based on the feedback, we have been developing the NVS Acquisition Strategy and NVS Technical Specification.  The draft NVS Strategic Plan was released to Industry on September 29, 2010 and is available on the FAA Contract Opportunities website at https://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm. It describes the high level FAA strategy for the NVS program and the target operating environment it will support.
The purpose of this announcement is to solicit the industry comments and approach on meeting some of the NVS functionalities as identified in the attached specification.  The feedback will assist the FAA in refining and validating the functional requirements of the proposed NVS system.
The FAA recognizes that in order for the industry to provide constructive feedback the NVS Technical Specification, the NVS functional block diagram, would be required.  Hence, attached is the draft preliminary NVS Technical Specification.  This specification is a work-in-progress and will be continually updated based on industry and stakeholder input.  Our goal is to develop an NVS specification that is consistent with the draft NVS Strategy Plan and identifies functional requirements for a flexible voice communications infrastructure to enable future NextGen operational improvements and capabilities.
In addition to the feedback on the specific questions posed in this RFI (which are included as a separate attachment) we would also like to obtain comments on the draft preliminary NVS Technical Specification.  The responses to the questions will provide a valuable and measured insight into the understanding and activities of the enterprise voice communication industry and the status of the NVS Technical Specification itself.  Based on the input and feedback, we will continue to update the NVS Technical Specification and share the information with industry as we move forward with the NVS Program.  Industry responses will be used to:
- Assess the current state of commercially available systems- Determine reasonableness of the requirements and whether significant redesign and development would be required- Determine whether the requirements as stated would restrict an offeror's system from providing the FAA with maximum benefit. 
The FAA requests written responses must be provided electronically to Kathy St. Hill at Kathy.StHill@faa.gov no later than 3:00 PM EST on Wednesday, November 17th, 2010.  Industry should use the attached template when preparing their responses.  All files must be submitted in Microsoft Word format.

<p>Anticipated Construction Work:<br />&bull; Milling and resurfacing of existing roadways<br />&bull; Installation and maintenance of temporary traffic control devices<br />&bull; Construction of new roadways with pavement markings, signing, and sidewalk<br />&bull; Construction of a roundabout with curb island dividers, interior paved island, and pedestrian access crossing in accordance with ADA requirements<br />&bull; Construction of drainage appurtenances and storm water management facilities<br />&bull; Turf establishment and any required installation of landscaping<br />&bull; Installation of temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control measures<br />&bull; Removal of existing pavements for roadways, and obliteration and turf re-establishment of extraneous pavement areas after roadway construction<br />&bull; Construction of temporary pavements for access to the Fort and for maintaining public traffic<br />&bull; Removal of existing security fencing and placement of temporary and permanent security fencing, matching existing<br />&bull; Obtaining all permits for construction, obtaining compensatory mitigation, and implementing permit requirements including erosion and sediment control measures <br />&bull; Utility relocation coordination with utility companies and installation of all in-plan utilities<br />&bull; Installation of sheeting, shoring, and other temporary safety protection devices for any required deep excavations or fills<br />&bull; Coordination with projects within the Fort<br />&bull; Coordination with affected property owners, the Army, VDOT, EFLHD and Prince George County<br />&bull; Development of as-built plans for VDOT, ARMY, and EFLHD; including survey, following construction<br />&bull; Acquisition of VDOT Land Use Permits necessary for project construction<br />&bull; Coordination with Fort Lee's DPW-Environmental Management Office to ensure all project designs is compatible with applicable Fort Lee Environmental Special Conditions.<br />&bull; Notification and coordination with Fort Lee's DPW and Environmental Management Office on UXO recognition and procedures to follow if UXO's are found.<br />&bull; Notification and coordination with Fort Lee's DPW-Environmental Management Office for handling and mitigation of hazardous spills.<br /><br />US Army Fort Lee Design Requirements:</p>
<p>Access to the "A" Gate entrance to the Fort from Adams Avenue must be available at all times. This may require temporary pavement for detouring around the construction limits.</p>
<p>A permanent security fence meeting Army, Fort Lee standards must be constructed outside the construction limits within the Fort prior to any construction and removal of existing security fencing. This work mostly affects relocation of Bull Hill Road.</p>
<p>A portion of the project right-of-way and construction limits are within the site of a former graveyard, which has recently undergone a ground penetration radar assessment for existing grave sites as a condition of the NEPA Environmental process by the Eastern Federal Lands Highway Division (EFLHD) of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). All grave sites are to be protected by construction fencing placed outside of identified grave sites, and placed off limits to any construction activity. Any realignments and construction of roadway adjacent to the limits of identified grave sites must remain within the existing VDOT roadway prism. No disturbance beyond the existing prism (pavement, shoulder, and roadway fill) will be allowed where adjacent to grave sites. The selected contractor will be responsible for NPDES for the project.</p>
<p>The project is expected to occur on VDOT ROW, federal lands controlled by Fort Lee Army Garrison. The U.S. Army will be providing an easement to provide additional right-of-way, and this action does require a change in land use in the easement. The intent is to obtain a temporary right of entry during construction and to get a permanent easement once construction is complete. Gas, water, and electrical utilities all have permits for active right of way in the area. Right of way utility easements would need to be updated to reflect any changes in utility placements. Please note that any utilities will need to be either relocated or avoided. The design and construction cost for award is expected to exceed $3,000,000. This project is "Subject to Availability of Funds".</p>
<p>In accordance with Public Law 104-106 (41 U.S.C. 253m), the EFLHD of the FHWA is conducting a "two phased" D-B selection process for U.S. Army Fort Lee and VDOT. Solicitation documents for Phase One, Request for Qualifications (RFQ), should be issued in November, 2010. Qualifications will be due in December, 2010 at the EFLHD office in Sterling, Virginia. An evaluation board will review and evaluate contractor qualifications and select the three most highly qualified D-B firms/teams to participate in Phase Two of this D-B selection process. Selection will be based on the established RFQ evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>During Phase Two, those firms/teams short-listed will be sent a Request for Proposal (RFP), which will outline the remainder of the process requirements including submission of technical and cost proposals. The Phase Two RFP is anticipated to be issued in January, 2011 with contract award occurring in April, 2011. A site visit will be scheduled during the RFP phase.</p>
<p>Please send all questions concerning this D-B project to eflhd.contracts@dot.gov. Include the solicitation number, project name and number, requesting firm and address, a point of contact and telephone number. Requests for 'faxing' or overnight mailing will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Use Internet address https://www.fbo.gov/ (at QUICK SEARCH, type "EFLHD" and all available projects will be listed) to check for availability of bid documents. All bid documents can be directly downloaded from this website. Documents will no longer be mailed. Register to receive Email Notification to automatically be notified when a document is added or updated for a specific project.</p>

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute on behalf of The National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal, and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) is seeking an organization who will provide executive secretarial/logistical support for the management of committees providing data and safety monitoring oversight to NIAMS funded clinical studies/trials and assessment and assistance with the conduct of clinical research to ensure data quality and adherence to good clinical practice, and Federal guidelines and policies. 

The NIAMS has oversight of over 60 clinical trials and several large scale epidemiological/observational studies and biospecimens repositories.  Areas of funded research include broadly arthritis, musculoskeletal, and skin diseases and other related diseases/conditions that are in the NIAMS mission areas. Clinical studies can be funded using various award mechanisms (i.e., cooperative agreements, grants and contracts) and could range in size (e.g., 10 to 5,000 participants), the scientific complexity, and the research methodology and study design.   Additionally, risk to human subjects is an important factor in evaluating the oversight needed for the studies in the Institutes clinical research portfolio, as it determines the type of data and safety monitoring body needed to assure that the safety and well-being of participants are being carefully monitored, and there is confidence in the quality and integrity of the results that are produced by these important studies.  

The Division of Extramural Research Activities (DERA) within the NIAMS Extramural Program (EP) is responsible for the administration and coordination of clinical research policies and guidelines for the oversight of clinical research, including establishing study monitoring committees for clinical trials.   

It is anticipated that technical support will entail such things as: 

(1)  Logistical and executive secretarial support for data safety monitoring boards (DSMBs and OSMBs), Scientific Advisory Committees and Steering Committees; 
(2)  Data quality assurance/quality control of clinical studies; 
(3)  Assistance in the conduct of clinical trials; 
(4)  Guidance on data safety and monitoring plans including guidance on protocol (MOOP) development; 
(5)  Training in the conduct of clinical trials; 
(6)  Consultation with program staff on policies and procedures related to clinical studies; 
(7)  Biostatistical support; 
(8)  Guidelines for clinical research; 
(9)  Providing support for data management resources and services for clinical studies including: recruitment strategy review and consultation; and review of statistical plans and analysis of approaches to studies; 
(10)  Development and maintenance of on-line tools including Tracking Tool Database; Secure Website for DSMB and other meetings information; Clinical Studies Database; and 
(11)  Maintain and monitor Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Adverse Events (AE) reports for selected studies. 

It is anticipated that one cost plus award fee contract award will be made for a period of five years beginning on or about September 1, 2011. 

The solicitation will be available electronically on or about November 5, 2010 and may be accessed through the Internet at the following address: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. under the National Heart Lung and Blood posting section.  Proposals will be due on or about January 4, 2011. Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments and for routinely checking the Internet site for any possible solicitation amendments that may be issued by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>This notice supercedes Solicitation # 10-05-2010 which was posted in the wrong procurement type category. NAVAIR intends to place a Firm Fixed Price delivery order under Contract N00019-11-G-0006 on a sole source basis with The Raytheon Company in support of the AN/ALR V-3 System for Foreign Military Sales to Canada. NAVAIR previously procured eight (8) Aft Enhanced Antenna Detectors (EADs) from Raytheon. This will be a follow-on contract to convert these units into eight (8) Direct Inject Integrated Microwave Integrated Circuits (IMIC) Assemblies. Raytheon is the sole designer, developer, manufacturer, and integrator of the AN/ALR V-3 system and its various configurations and is the only source with the knowledge, expertise, facilities, and qualified personnel to accomplish the task. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation document exists.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government does not intend to fund the development or qualification of other sources for fulfilling this requirement, as production of the supplies listed requires a substantial initial investment or an extended period of preparation for manufacture. However, all proposals received within thirty days after the publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />

<RESPDATE>110410
<CONTACT>Patrick Smith, Contract Specialist, Email patrick.w.smith2@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Integrated Systems Solutions Inc, 22685 Three Notch Rd, California, MD 20619 for technical support services for the procurement of information technology, management anaylsis, and flight operations scheduling support services for the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) in the support it provides to the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Test Pilot School (TPS). The Government intends to procure the above service under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1, to ensure there will not be a break in the services required, while a competitive Seaport-e Task Order is being put in place. The period of performance on this procurement will be six months from date of award.
<p>The Test Pilot School is a unique organization and requires contractor personnel to perform management and flight scheduling support with the knowledge of the intricacies of the school's operation to ensure all aspects of the flight and academic curriculum can be met on schedule to meet graduation requirements of its ongoing classes. Integrated Systems Solutions, Inc. is currently supplying the support services for this requirement. It is in the Government's best interest to extend the contract and increase the level of effort. This will insure there will not be a break in the services required, which would be detrimental to the Test Pilot Program. The impact of failing to award this continued support for the Test Pilot School is both operational and financial. Flight operations to train pilots for scheduled RDT&amp;E testing of the Navy Airship MZ-3A will be disrupted delaying capability to provide test pilots for this important program to the Navy to test improved communications systems that allow no interruptions between personnel and mobile stations. Furthermore, there is a financial impact to disrupting the testing because a restart after a stoppage will lead to duplication of costs that will not be recovered.</p>
<p>This increase is being processed soley for the purpose to insure continuity of services to avoid interruption of program support. There is a competitive&nbsp;procurement package in process for the contractor support service requirements. This sole source action is a temporary bridge for the continuation of services until the Seaport-e Task Order is in place. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal in writing. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received within 15 days of publication of this notice. Responses should reference N68335-11-R-0022. The Point of Contact is: Mr. Patrick Smith, email: patrick.w.smith2@navy.mil.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
The U.S. Army, Contracting Command, JM&L Contracting Center is soliciting information from industry concerning the availability and development status of an acoustic technology capable of providing Hostile Fire Indication (HFI) for use on rotary wing aircraft.  Hostile fire is defined as small caliber (assault rifle) ammunition up through and including large caliber anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) fires, unguided rockets, and rocket propelled grenades (RPG).  The technology is intended to provide real time hostile fire detection, identification, and angle of arrival information.  By providing threat location, HFI will allow the aircrew to perform evasive and counter-fire actions significantly increasing the probability of survival.  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to determine the technical, manufacturing, and integration maturity of the technology required to meet the need for an Acoustic Hostile Fire Indicator (A-HFI) system.  Determine the effort required to mature current technology to a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) of 8, Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) of 8, and platform based Integration Readiness Level (IRL) of 8. The intent is to use this data to aid in preparing a Market Analysis, defining an acquisition strategy, and assessing risks involved in implementing an A-HFI capability on rotary wing aircraft.  Rotary wing aircraft lack an A-HFI system for operating within the current threat environment.  Currently, aircrews are the sole source of hostile fire identification.  The inability to accurately and timely identify enemy weapon system engagements decreases the overall survivability of the aircraft, the ability to redirect fire against enemy targets, and overall mission success.  Therefore, there is a need for an A-HFI that detects, identifies, and locates threat systems in real time.The fundamental purpose of the A-HFI is to notify aircrews that they are being engaged by threat weapon systems.  The A-HFI will detect, identify, and alert on hostile fire threats, thereby providing enhanced Situational Awareness (SA) to the air crew.   Once hostile fire is detected and declared, the A-HFI will send threat messages to the onboard Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) suite controller.  The A-HFI will assist in geolocation and determining range to the shooter.  The onboard ASE suite controller will provide warning to the aircrew through bearing, elevation, and range to the enemy weapon system.  The A-HFI will have an open system architecture and sufficient growth potential to include emerging threats.  The A-HFI technology will be designed for modularity, reprogramability, reliability, and maintainability. 
The required performance characteristics of the A-HFI are as follows:
	The system shall detect small caliber ammunition up through and including large caliber anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) fires.  Hostile fire also includes unguided rockets such as rocket propelled grenades (RPG) and similar type projectiles.  
	The system shall provide detection in a wide variety of high noise environments and operate at platform speeds including cruising, hovering, and tactical flights without performance degradation.
	The system shall provide on-the-move capability and continuous updates of the potential threat location.
	The system shall function in all terrains, adverse weather and all environmental conditions in which the aircraft is operated during night and day operations.
Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.  Written responses to the RFI shall be no greater than 20 pages in length, describing the concept, capabilities, and limitations.  Submission of proprietary and other sensitive information shall be clearly marked and identified with disposition instructions.  The white paper must be single-sided with double-spaced text, page size no larger than 8.5 by 11 inches, font size no smaller than 12 point, one-inch margins on left, right, and bottom sides, 1.25 inch top margins on all pages.  Submitted material will not be returned.  Multiple RFI responses may be submitted for different technology solutions to the A-HFI concept.  Responses may be up to the classification level of unclassified.  The responses shall include but not be limited to a summary of the companys experience with A-HFI technology solutions and capabilities in research and development, testing, and manufacturing, description of the candidate A-HFI technological solution that can satisfy the A-HFI concept and how it may be integrated into rotary wing aircraft.  A description of the developmental effort required to produce an A-HFI prototype; top-level schedule to develop, build, or modify test articles and test a solution the effort required to mature the hardware and software technology to a TRL of 8, an MRL of 8, and an IRL of 8, and the amount of time required to mature the technology. Identify any Government Furnished Material or information required for the A-HFI development.  Response should identify their current business structures: company name and address to include contact persons name, telephone numbers (voice and fax) and E-mail address.
Test data available to support both hardware and software claims of TRL, MRL and IRL levels is required.  Responses to this RFI shall be submitted within 30 calendar days from the date of this publication to:
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes  it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Army is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI and all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partys expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.

<p>BACKGROUND<br />On October 5, 2009, President Obama signed Executive Order (EO) 13514 - Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy and Economic Performance. This Order seeks to establish an integrated strategy towards sustainability in the federal government and to make reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions a priority for federal agencies. It requires all agencies to establish and report a comprehensive inventory of absolute GHG emissions, set percentage targets to reduce GHG emissions agency-wide, and develop a plan for meeting a wide range of sustainability goals and targets. Agencies have until January 31, 2011, to submit an inventory of GHG emissions generated during fiscal year 2010. Thereafter agencies are required to report annually, at the end of January, for the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<p>GSA has developed the GSA Carbon Footprint Tool to assist agencies in managing their GHGs as required by EO 13514. The tool can assist with a broad range of tasks, including:</p>
<p>&bull; Calculation of an agency's GHG baseline, broken down by the different scopes<br />&bull; Assistance with developing GHG reduction targets<br />&bull; Compilation of a building-by-building GHG emissions inventory<br />&bull; Preparation for reporting emissions to the Department of Energy's GHG Reporting Portal</p>
<p>Additional information on the GSA Carbon Footprint Tool can be found at www.gsa.gov/carbonfootprint.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES<br />GSA's current task order for contracting support expires in 2011 and the agency is preparing to conduct a procurement for this requirement. GSA will require a tool that has the same salient characteristics as the current GSA Carbon Footprint Tool, including the ability to meet all existing reporting requirements as specified in Federal GHG Accounting and Reporting Guidance and the Technical Support Document accompanying section 9 of Executive Order 13514 as well as adherence to the Public Sector Protocol. GSA is also interested in expanding the application of the agency GHG emissions data that is collected through the tool. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain feedback on current commercial capabilities and practices with respect to GHG emissions inventory tools.</p>
<p>RESPONSES<br />Contractors are requested to provide basic information regarding similar GHG emissions inventory tools by addressing the following questions:</p>
<p>&bull; What existing GHG emissions inventory tools are commercially available? <br />&bull; What are the features, capabilities, etc. of these tools?<br />&bull; What are the other potential agency uses for the collected GHG data? What are other organizations using this GHG data for?<br />&bull; What other value-added services do you provide related to the collected GHG data (e.g. analysis of emissions profile, energy savings opportunities, etc.)?</p>
<p>Additionally, respondents are encouraged to address the following questions:</p>
<p>&bull; What is your company's socioeconomic designation (i.e. large business, small business, etc.)?<br />&bull; In providing this service, what features characterize the best in class service from an environmental perspective (e.g. Are there accepted industry standards related to environmental sustainability? Do you use "green" products during performance of this service? Are there other ways to reduce the environmental impact of providing this service)? <br />&bull; Does your firm have a Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) contract? Does your firm have a Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC)?</p>
<p><strong>Responses shall be sent no later than Wednesday, October 27, 2010 to adam.jones@gsa.gov <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AND</span> mahruba.uddowla@gsa.gov. </strong></p>

<DESC>The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) Requirements and Capabilities Integration Directorate, ASC/XR, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is issuing a Capability Request for Information (CRFI). THIS IS A CAPABILITY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This CRFI solicits information from Department of Defense (DoD ), other government agencies, US and/or foreign companies who can provide promising technologies and system concepts that can achieve a Joint Future Theater Lift (JFTL) capability. The Government will use the CRFI responses to inform on-going cost and capability analyses and provide an analytical foundation to inform the FY14 Program Objective Memorandum (POM). Small Businesses are encouraged to provide responses to this CRFI in order to assist ASC in determining potential levels of competition available in the industry.
<p>This CRFI initiates a call to investigate the realm of the possible in regards to aircraft concepts and associated technologies which could support Air Mobility Command's (AMC) Joint Future Theater Lift Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) requirement. The Government will consider system concepts having anticipated technology and manufacturing readiness levels (TRL/MRL) of 6 no later than 2019. TRL/MRL applies to fully mission capable aircraft and their associated technologies and integrated logistics support (training, maintenance, supply, support equipment, etc).</p>
<p>JFTL is envisioned as a next generation theater lift capability that enables routine logistics and payload delivery/extraction airlift missions into complex, austere, unimproved/unprepared landing areas. JFTL capabilities will significantly contribute to the following operations within the Range of Military Operations: theater airlift of cargo and passengers, combat employment and sustainment (expanded to include Mounted Vertical Maneuver), aero-medical evacuation, support of special operations, forcible entry, strikes and raids, support of irregular warfare, noncombatant evacuation operations, recovery operations, and homeland defense. JFTL will be required to provide movement, maneuver, and distributed sustainment in an environment where increased capacity, speed, payload, range, agility, access, depth, precision, simultaneity and survivability will be at a premium. JFTL airlift capabilities will need to provide the battle space access, precision of delivery, and responsiveness of action needed for rapid decision. To do this, the JFTL will be capable of (1) moving medium-weight armored vehicles and personnel to strategic, operationally and tactically significant depths and (2) supporting maneuver in close proximity to objectives and sustainment of distributed forces in complex, austere, unimproved/unprepared landing areas to point of need/point of effect. The platform must be able to carry and/or airdrop required cargo loads into and out of complex, austere, unimproved/unprepared landing areas (requiring no additional infrastructure or material handling support equipment) and exploiting these landing areas to achieve runway-independent takeoff and landing operations. JFTL must also be capable of operating in adverse weather conditions and in low to medium threat environments (2024+). <br /><br />More detailed JFTL requirements can be found in the attached detailed JTS CRFI that accompanies this posting.<br />This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).

<SUBJECT>Request for Information - C-21 Contractor Logistics Support
<SOLNBR>RFI-C21-CLS
<RESPDATE>100110
<CONTACT>Samuel T. McDuffey, Contracting Officer, Phone 405-739-4448, Email samuel.mcduffey@tinker.af.mil
<DESC>The CLS Sustainment Division (formerly 727 ACSG). This is a Request for Information (RFI) only, as part of a market research. The CLS Sustainment Division is seeking to identify sources that may be capable of providing Site Maintenance to include depot support and aircraft modifications and Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) for approximately 47 C-21A aircraft. In addition, the Government is seeking industry input regarding the possible scenarios presented below. There is no solicitation package available at this time. All interested parties should send company and/or descriptive literature along with responses to the following questions and any comments or questions to Mr. Samuel McDuffey, e-mail: samuel.mcduffey@tinker.af.mil. All responses should be received no later than 3:00 PM CST, 1 October 2010. All questions and comments must be in writing, no telephone calls. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. <br /><br />The government is looking at the possibility of awarding a Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) contract to provide site maintenance, Contract Operated Maintained Base Supply (COMBS), Contract Field Team (CFT), and modification installation support for 47 aircraft at 10 different sites (8 CONUS, 1 OCONUS, 1 deployed). This breakout would include COMBS support only for 19 aircraft at 3 CONUS sites and full CLS maintenance for the remaining aircraft. The 3 CONUS sites have experienced higher parts consumption rates than anticipated. The government has limited usage data, but history is not a predictor of future events. The government does not own any spares or support equipment, therefore it would be the responsibility of the contractor to provide.
<p>There is a possibility that a drawdown will take place which would remove the COMBS support only requirement for the 19 aircraft at 3 CONUS sites starting FY12, 4th Qtr. The reduction may include quarterly reductions in aircraft with one site closing at the end of FY13, 1st Qtr, and the two other sites closing at the end of FY13, 4th Qtr. There is no known probable reduction for the remaining 28 aircraft or closure of any other sites for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><strong>General Questions</strong><br />1) Do you currently provide Aircraft Maintenance and Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) to customers who operate small business jets?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) If so, how many locations, number of aircraft, and model aircraft do you support?</p>
<p>2) Has your company had experience (in the past 5 years) providing Aircraft Maintenance and COMBS to a fleet of business type jet aircraft in excess of 45 aircraft in multiple locations?</p>
<p>3) Has your company had experience (in the past 5 years) providing only COMBS support for military maintainers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Did you face any challenges?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) If so, what challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?</p>
<p>4) Has your company had experience (in the past 5 years) providing Aircraft Maintenance and COMBS outside of the continental United States and its territories? Where was that customer located?</p>
<p>5) Assuming the scope of work does not change, how long of a period of performance can you accurately project your costs?</p>
<p>6) How long is your typical contractual arrangement established with vendors and subcontractors?</p>
<p>7) Do you have the ability to perform engineering service capability on a commercial derivative Lear Jet 35A i.e. C-21A</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) What limitations of engineering support if any would you have?</p>
<p>8) What are your thoughts on this effort being a total small business set-aside?</p>
<p>9) The Government is contemplating a service contract, NAICS Code 488190, what category does your company fall within; small business, veteran-owned small business, small disadvantaged business, Certified 8A, Hub Zone small business, women-owned small business, large business?</p>
<p>10) What previous experience does your company have with Government contracts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Is your company familiar with the Government processes of contracting, billing, engineering, etc.?</p>
<p>11) If you had previous contracts with the Government, what types of pricing arrangement were used?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) What type of pricing arrangement would you recommend for the contract?</p>
<p>12) What does your company specialize in?</p>
<p><strong>In an effort to plan for a possible drawdown, the government has come up with several scenarios. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Scenario #1. The government anticipates the award of a 5-year contract (1-year base w/4 one year option periods) beginning on or about FY13, 1st Qtr. This scenario places the new contractor in a situation where they could possibly be required to stand up and shut down one CONUS site within the first few months of award and the other two CONUS sites within the first ten months of award. The three sites having 19 aircraft would require COMBS support only; keeping in mind the contractor would be required to purchase/lay-in of all spares and parts. Additionally upon award the contractor would be required to provide COMBS and Aircraft Maintenance to 4 other CONUS sites, 1 OCONUS, and 1 deployed site for 28 aircraft. The government will not provide support equipment, spares or parts.</strong></p>
<p>13) What challenges would the contractor face if required to stand up and shut down sites in this timeframe while maintaining the requirements for the stable fleet of 28 aircraft? Please include cost, schedule and other challenges that pertain to supply inventory, personnel hiring, support equipment, overhead management, etc. How would the contractor handle these challenges?</p>
<p>14) What other recommendations/approaches can you offer that would provide USAF insight that would result in successful Contractor Logistic Services COMBS effort for these 19 aircraft? <br /><br />15) What are your recommendations and/or concerns with this scenario?</p>
<p>16) Are there any concerns regarding this period of performance?</p>
<p>17) Provide any other comments you have for this 5-year scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario #2. The government anticipates the award of a 5-year contract (1-year base w/4 one year option periods) beginning on or about 1 October 2012. For COMBS and Aircraft Maintenance for 28 aircraft at 4 CONUS, 1 OCONUS, and 1 deployed site. In this scenario, there is no expectation of aircraft drawdown. The government will not provide support equipment, spares or parts. </strong></p>
<p>18) What challenges would the contractor face with this scenario? Please include cost, schedule and others challenges that pertain to supply inventory, personnel hiring, support equipment, etc. How would the contractor handle these challenges?</p>
<p>19) What other recommendations/approaches can you offer that would provide USAF insight that would result in successful Contractor Logistic Services COMBS and Aircraft Maintenance effort for these aircraft? <br /><br />20) What are your recommendations and/or concerns with this source selection?</p>
<p>21) Are there any concerns regarding this period of performance?</p>
<p>22) Provide any other comments you have for this 5-year scenario.</p>
<p>23) Do you foresee a significant savings between scenario 2 versus scenario 1? If so please explain and illustrate how the government could benefit from such savings, for example cost savings, program success, streamline processes etc.</p>
<p>24) In reference to the two previous options presented please provide an assessment to each for probable success using the following scale:</p>
<p>1= high probability not to succeed without relief of requirements to 10 being high a probability of success with little to no duress to the contractor or the government</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Scenario 1 High Risk 1-------------5------------10 Low Risk<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Scenario 2 High Risk 1-------------5------------10 Low Risk</p>
<p><strong>Scenario #3. The government anticipates the award of a 2-year bridge contract (1-year base w/4 quarterly option periods) beginning approximately 1 October 2011. This scenario places the contractor in a situation where they would be required to provide short term COMBS support (10 months to 2 years) at the 3 closing sites for 19 aircraft and simultaneously maintain Aircraft Maintenance and COMBS support for 28 aircraft located at 4 additional CONUS sites, 1 OCONUS, and 1 deployed site. The government will not provide support equipment, spares or parts. </strong></p>
<p>25) What challenges would the contractor face if required to stand up and shut down sites in this timeframe, (2 years or less)? Please include cost, schedule and others challenges that pertain to supply inventory, personnel hiring, support equipment, etc. How would the contractor handle these challenges?</p>
<p>26) Do you foresee your organization desiring to participate in such an endeavor as this 2-year scenario? If so what challenges does this short term contract present for the contractor? Please include cost, schedule and other challenges that would pertain to this scenario.</p>
<p>27) Do you foresee being able to economically amortize your capital investment of this scenario over the 2-year period or should the government expect an above normal cost due to the contract term and activity? Please provide a detailed explanation of your response.</p>
<p>28) What other recommendations /approaches can you offer that would provide USAF insight that would result in successful Contractor Logistic Services COMBS and Aircraft Maintenance effort for these aircraft? <br /><br />29) What are your recommendations and/or concerns with this source selection?</p>
<p>30) Are there any concerns regarding this period of performance?</p>
<p>31) Provide any other comments you have for the 2-year scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Questions</strong></p>
<p>32) What advantages/disadvantages do you perceive for using a FAR Part 12, firm-fixed priced contract?</p>
<p>33) Provide any other commercial suggestions or approaches to fulfilling this requirement.</p>

<a href="mailto:Kathy_Mannion@blm.gov">Mannion, Kathy J</a>
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management has utilized a Blanket Purchase Agreement and awarded the subject order to Premier Data Services. A Modification (0002) was issued Aug. 18, 2010 to utilize an option line item in the original agreement to complete additional CDI card scans. Additional funding in the amount of $1,534,822 is obligated against this order.  Below is a description of the requirement.
The BLM maintains thousands of historic vital records of public land ownership in Montana. These records contain copies of original documents that have been microfilmed and are currently stored as a collection of microfilm aperture cards referred to as the Control Document Index (CDI). The BLM, Montana State Office has only one set of these aging microfilm aperture cards that are cumbersome to research and are not backed up in a digital format. The cards contain images of records that date back to the mid-1800s and include copies of patents and deeds that convey title of public lands to and from the United States. 
The purpose of this project is to scan up to 1,416,660 land status records from these micro-graphic copies of legal documents mounted on aperture cards.  Funding for this Modification will be used to scan approximately 1,053,637 CDI Cards. These records are within the states of Montana and the Dakotas and include townships identified as having existing renewable energy applications/authorizations or high renewable energy potential.  This project will enable the BLM to more efficiently evaluate right of way applications and permits for renewable energy or other projects in a more efficient and timely manner; thereby saving the public and the BLM time in the land use application process.  This will also improve the automation and quality assurance of BLMs current land status information

A Modification (0002) was issued Aug. 24, 2010 to utilize an option line item in the original agreement to complete services required under this order. Additional funding in the amount of $64,691.00 is obligated against this order.  Below is a description of the requirement.
Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, the New Mexico BLM has been tasked with ensuring accuracy of the attributes of digital land records.  The geographic location of the identified renewable energy townships is primarily in areas having the potential for renewable energy in support of the current administrations energy priorities and in the transmission of that energy.  There are 1266 townships associated with renewable energy.  All work is limited to these 1266 townships.
The vendor shall compare MTPs and HIs against title documents to ensure that land ownership status is accurately depicted and described.  Documents are to be compared to MTPs, Use Plats,   and LR2000 digital records to ensure data are accurately described as noted.  These documents include any and all types of cases noted on the plats.  Records that have not been scanned will be scanned by the vendor during this process.  The vendor shall then examine all Rights-of-ways or other case file types for review of those cases within the jurisdiction of the field offices.  These examinations will likely involve scanning of records that have not yet been scanned.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management has utilized a Blanket Purchase Agreement and awarded the subject order to Premier Data Services. A Modification (0002) was issued Sep. 21, 2010 to utilize an option line item in the original agreement (L10PB00476) to complete approximately 960 additional townships under this order. Additional funding in the amount of $95,685.81 is obligated against this order.  Below is a description of the requirement.
The Bureau of Land Management has been compiling survey information and GPS positions to accurately portray the Public Land Survey System in support of parcel based recording, analysis and display of geographic information.  This information called the Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB), however, has been assembled in a series of ASCII flat files and need to be converted to a GIS format to support stakeholders and customers for the information. 
The Western Governors Association has recognized GCDB as the best hope of standardizing cadastral information in the West in support of livable communities as well as economic development.  In order to make GCDB a more accessible and useable product, it is being converted to the GIS format used by BLM.  This task will improve GCDB data in designated priority areas and improve topological integrity and attribution of the data.  The vendor shall complete this conversion process for the BLM on approximately 1603 townships.

<DESC>The Montpelier Ranger District, Caribou-Targhee National Forest is anticipating awarding a fuels treatment contract for the treatment (hand thinning/lopping) of approximately 500 acres of trees and brush. The timeframe to accomplish the fuels treatement activities will be from June 1, 2011 to July 15, 2011. Final acreages and specifications will be described within a forthcoming solicitation.
<p>The forest would like to hold a site visit for the project with prospective contractors before snow blankets the ground this fall. The site visit will be held on Wednesday, November 3, 2010 at 10:00am. Interested contractors should meet at the junction of State Highways 34 and 91 at the Phillips 66/Burger King in Preston, Idaho. The project site location is approximately 9 miles south on Highway 91 (town of Franklin, ID), then turning east towards the Caribou-Targhee National Forest bounday of the Montepelier Ranger District, approximately 9 miles to the parking lot located just inside the Forest Service lands in the Maple Creek drainage.</p>
<p>Road conditions on the last, approximately 8 miles, are of native materials and with a strong probability of being wet and or snow/ice covered, with corresponding slick and difficult driving conditions. Good tires on a high clearance 4 x 4 wheel drive vehicle are considered a necessity to enable potential contractors to reach the Forest boundary and the lowest edge of the project area.</p>
<p>This will be the only planned site visit for this project and as the season progresses, access will become more difficult if not impossible without using skis or snowshoes, as snowmobile access will be very unlikely and of little aid to accessing/viewing the area.</p>
<p>In order to correctly evaluate this project and the extent of the services involved, it is highly recommended that all potential vendors come prepared for arduous hiking to fully assess this project.</p>
<p>For further information regarding this project, please contact Ken Klingenberg, Rebecca Phelps or Garth Alleman at 208-847-0375.</p>

<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition
Date:	9/27/2010Project:	Cellular Services, Yellowstone National ParkPurchase Request #:	R1577111010
1.	Identificationsa.	Agency:		National Park Serviceb.	Contracting Office:	Yellowstone National Park
2.	Description of the action being approved:The National Park Service (NPS) shall be soliciting for cellular services on existing phones and other wireless devices. The documents included with the solicitation call for specific brand name products that are peculiar to one manufacturer. This written justification provides approval for limiting competition to the listed brand name products as authorized by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).
Description of supplies and services:  Voice, Text, and Data wireless telecommunications packages.
3.	Scope of Work and Government Cost Estimate: Service for 125 cell phones, 41 blackberry devices, and 11 air cards.  Cost estimated is at $85,000 annually, based on estimated usage.  4.	Authority:	a.	41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.b.	FAR Part 11.105: The Brand Name products are essential to the Government's requirements, and market research indicates other companies' similar products do not meet and cannot be modified to meet the agency's needs.c.	FAR 6.302-1: The use of the name brand products are essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.
5.	The description of the contractor's unique qualifications or the unique nature of the acquisition:Verizon Wireless is a sole source provider for wireless communication in Yellowstone Park because they are the only wireless telecommunications provider that provides service at all existing sites in Yellowstone, Mammoth, Grant Village, Old Faithful, Canyon, and West Yellowstone. Other providers have service at a few selected sites, and contracting with these providers would limit use and decrease value to the Government. Contracting with another service provider would reduce the availability of service resulting in negative consequences for law enforcement and emergency medical service responders throughout Yellowstone Park. 
6.	Efforts to obtain competition:A synopsis (sources sought notice) will be posted on FedBizOpps.a.	Efforts to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:
A sources sought notice was posted on FedBizOpps on 9/22/2010 with the following results:
No responses were received as a result of this notice.
7.	Determination that costs will be fair & reasonable:a.	The contractor's proposed prices shall be prices that are offered on their GSA Contract, which have already been competed and are considered to be fair and reasonable.
8.	Description of the market research conducted:a.	A sources sought notice was posted on FedBizOpps on 9/22/2010 as outlined in 6 above.b.	Right of way agreements and on the ground usage makes it clear that Verizon provides the widest and most reliable cellular coverage in Yellowstone. This has been consistent since 1997. 9.	Other facts supporting other than full & open competition:a.	Reason why documents suitable for full & open competition have not been developed:Yellowstone will consider competition with other service providers' cell phones when other service providers have equal or better representation.b.    Data, estimated costs or other rationale as to the extent or harm to the Government: 		The contractor's prices will be compared to the prices paid for similar services in the past.		The contractor's prices will also be verified to be what is provided on their GSA Contract.
10.	Interested Sources:Verizon has territorial coverage areas and we are required to use this contractor in our area.
11.	Actions to remove barriers to competition in the future for similar acquisitions:The Telecommunications Branch of Administration receives requests for rights of way from providers and works with the Superintendent and Regional Director to process agreements where recommended and approved under the Wireless Telecommunications Plan. Co-location is generally accepted on existing towers and in wireless telecommunications facilities where permitted by the plan, and agreed to by the owners. Yellowstone processes these requests in a timely manner in accordance with RM53 Special park uses.
Yellowstone National Park will continue to look for other available sources and advertise Yellowstone's needs to initiate interest for firms to develop.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research intends to purchase a one-year membership in the Santa Fe Institute's Business Network. Santa Fe Institute is a non-profit research organization that uses multidisciplinary collaboration to study behavior and structure of complex systems, with emphasis on complex systems that exhibit adaptation and learning. Santa Fe Institute's research into computer simulation systems builds on a broad base of studies in complex adaptive systems. The simulation programs, and more general computational approaches, are built on the concept of adaptive agents capable of learning in response to experience. Many of the approaches incorporate processes that mimic biological systems and organisms, including mutation, generic crossover, evolution and co-evolution and differential retention of successful genotypes. Areas of work include use of genetic algorithms, classifier systems, neural networks, genetic programming and other related machine learning methods. A Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Order using Simplified Acquisition Procedures will provide one membership in the Santa Fe Institute Business Network for Complex Systems Research for a period of one year. The participant will participate in research visits, workshops, technical meetings and seminars, and receive copies of working papers and books resulting from these research programs.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI), issued to promote exchanges of information between government and industry, as defined in FAR 15.201.  Responses to this notice will NOT be considered an offer and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.<BR><BR><BR>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  <BR>The Chemical Biological Medical Systems Joint Project Management Office (CBMS JPMO), under the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD), is issuing a RFI to obtain information on Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems that may be applicable to the Next Generation Diagnostic System (NGDS) Increment 1 program.  The NGDS Increment 1 rapid acquisition program is intended to provide a complementary identification or diagnostic capability to existing Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) users or an initial capability to the broader DoD human and veterinarian community.  The Increment 1 acquisition strategy includes Preplanned Product Improvements (P3I) to the initial capability to add additional U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared diagnostic assays for Biological Warfare Agents (BWA) (e.g. anthrax and smallpox) threats and emerging infectious diseases over the system's lifecycle.  The NGDS will follow an evolutionary acquisition approach to best meet near and long-term goals and to exploit the exponential growth in the biotechnology field.  The overall NGDS program is envisioned to be family-of-systems providing modular orthogonal diagnostics capabilities across all operational echelons (tactical, field confirmatory, fixed facilities) and fielded over several acquisition increments.  Subsequent NGDS increments will not replace Increment 1 but will expand upon Increment 1 in a modular and/or echeloned approach.  NGDS may also include enabling technologies to enhance the screening, collection and transport of clinical samples for diagnostic analysis and back end data analysis and fusion.  <BR><BR>A broad range of potential materiel solutions may be applicable to NGDS Increment 1:<BR>"	Diagnostic nucleic acid detection platforms and assays<BR>"	Diagnostic non-nucleic acid detection platforms and assays<BR>"	Non-diagnostic platforms and assays for pathogens, toxins and/or biomarkers of chemical, biological or radiological exposure<BR>"	Automated sample preparation -

<p>Title: OS on Secure (FIPS 140-2 Level 3) USB Devices</p>
<p>Date: June 17, 2010</p>
<p>******************************************************************************</p>
<p>FEMA OCIO would like to welcome and encourage all companies to participate in this solicitation that have the technology and resources that we are seeking. This is a "Full and Open Competition" for Commercial Items (See Clauses below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />This solicitation will result in a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) award with (1) one year base period and several optional CLINS that can be exercised at the government's discretion (see Phase II SOW for CLIN structure).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />Prior to FEMA posting this RFP for the OS Secure USB we posted an RFI to the industry via Fed Biz Opps for any and all vendors to submit samples in which were tried and tested by the government. We chose this method to gauge the current technology for the OS Secure USB and received numerous responses with samples. Because there was a market arena that is able to provide this technology we are seeking and are posting a formal RFP which will still allow for new vendors as well as the past vendors during the RFI to submit their proposals/samples to the government for consideration.</p>
<p><br />FEMA OCIO is hereby requesting that you submit an offer to: participate in Phase I: providing OS Secure USB sample test devices (per the instructions of the attachment) and Phase II: providing a Technical and Cost proposal as per the SOW attachment. Ultimately the goal of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to select a contractor to provide service and two hundred OS on Secure (200) FIPS 140-2 level 3 certified USB devices, the Operating System to allow access to the Agency's Windows based software system, along with the service to configure, install, and provide the Government the capability to centrally manage the devices (remote management via a web based control center) For full disclosure please **carefully read attachment Phase I and Phase II.</p>
<p>******************************************************************************</p>
<p>*********Please note there will be "NO CALLS, or Emails answered or addressed until the Q&amp;A session (for full details see below) ***** failure to comply will result in a non-acceptance for the proposal/samples from the vendor.</p>
<p>****************************************************************************** <br />See the following Attachments:<br />1. Requirements Statement, Instructions to Offerors, and Contract Clauses Attachment<br />2. Phase I: Samples/Technical Requirements/Evaluation<br />3. Phase II: Technical/Cost Proposal/SOW<br />4.

<RESPDATE>120710
<CONTACT>Susan Eicher, Email susan.eicher@dhs.gov
<DESC>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA11-01) seeks research and development proposals for the purposes of producing highly specific, robust, and accurate lateral flow immunoassays (LFA) for the detection of bacterial biothreat agents and toxins. These assays are intended for use by the First Responder community for the detection and identification of bacterial biothreat agents and toxins present in "white powder" samples, and other suspected material encountered by the First Responder community. The creation of such assays include establishing the protocol for sample preparation or recovery, all extraction methods, performance of the actual analysis of the antigenic signature of the agents from their associated samples using LFA, unambiguous interpretation of results (i.e., positive or negative).
<p>Lateral flow immunoassay systems are fundamentally immunoassays adapted to function along a single axis or test strip format. A typical double antibody capture assay system consists of several components. These assays can be interpreted visually, or by utilizing specialized instruments or readers.<br />1. The sample pad - an absorbent pad onto which the analyte is applied. <br />2. Conjugate or reagent pad - to which specific antibodies to the analyte are conjugated to colored particles (usually colloidal gold particles, or latex microspheres). <br />3. Reaction membrane - usually hydrophobic nitrocellulose or cellulose acetate membrane onto which specific antibodies to the analyte are immobilized in a line across the membrane as a capture zone or test line; (a control zone may also be present, containing antibodies specific for the conjugate antibodies). <br />4. Wick or waste reservoir - an absorbent pad designed to draw the sample across the reaction membrane by capillary action and collect it. <br />5. A method of collecting the sample is considered part of the assay system.</p>

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541430 with a small business size of $7,000,000.00. <br /><br />The following provisions and/or clauses apply to this acquisition: <br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items. <br />a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Price<br />2. Technical capability<br />3. Past performance (see FAR 15.304)<br />Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br /><br />ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS, JAN 1999 (IAW FAR 12.301 (c))</p>
<p>1.0. Introduction: This is a competitive best value solicitation. The offeror's technical ability and past performance will be considered significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>2.0. General Basis for Award: The Government seeks to award to an offeror who gives the Air Force the best value. This competitive best value, performance price tradeoff will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 12, FAR 13.106 and FAR 15).</p>
<p>2.1 "Offeror shall submit a quote on company letterhead with the name, address, and telephone number (s), provide for a delivery/completion time, address technical ability as related to the attached Statement of Work, Past Performance information, Price, and terms of any express warranty;</p>
<p>3.0. Evaluation: Each offeror's proposal will be evaluated against the following factors: technical evaluation, past performance, and price. All technically acceptable offers shall be treated equally. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. The team will evaluate information received from the offeror regarding technical ability, performance of current or past contracts, and other credible or supportable information available to adequately measure the offeror's ability to successfully perform the requirements of the resulting contract. The offeror's technical ability and past performance shall be significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>4.0. Technical Ability and Past Performance: The Government reserves the right to obtain and evaluate technical ability and past performance information from any source it deems appropriate. The purpose of the technical and past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past technical capabilities and performance.</p>
<p>4.1 The Government may seek any relevant performance information on the offeror based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources.</p>
<p>4.2 The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of High Confidence, Significant Confidence, Confidence, or No Confidence.</p>
<p>4.3 To be considered technically capable, the offeror must be able to perform the services requested in the attached Statement of Work. Submissions shall be limited to a maximum of 15 pages. The technical ability confidence assessment verbiage is as follows:<br />&emsp;</p>
<p>TABLE 1 - TECHNICAL RATINGS<br />Color Rating Description<br /><br />Blue Exceptional Exceeds specified minimum technical capability requirements listed in the Statement of Work in a way beneficial to the government. A proposal must have one or more strength and no deficiencies to receive a blue.<br /><br />Green Acceptable Meets specified minimum technical capability requirements as listed in the Statement of Work. A proposal must have no deficiencies to receive a green but may have one or more strengths.<br /><br />Yellow Marginal There is doubt regarding whether an aspect of the proposal meets specified minimum technical capability requirements, but any such uncertainty is correctable.<br /><br />Red Unacceptable Fails to meet specified minimum performance or capability requirements. The proposal has one or more deficiencies and is not awardable.</p>
<p>4.4 The Past Performance confidence assessment verbiage is as follows:</p>
<p>TABLE 2 - PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS<br />Description<br /><br />High Confidence Based on the offeror's past performance record, essentially no doubt exists the offeror will successfully perform the required efforts.<br /><br />Significant Confidence Based on the offeror's past performance record, the Government has significant confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />Confidence Based on the offeror's past performance record, the Government has confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />No Confidence Based on the offeror's past performance record, extreme doubt exists the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>4.4.1 An offeror with limited or no recent or relevant past performance will receive a rating of Unknown Confidence, and will not be rated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Definitions of relevancy and recency are as follows:</p>
<p>Relevancy: Commercial or Government contracts which perform Graphics Visual Media Support or contracts of similar or equivalent magnitude as identified in the Statement of Work (Attachment 1).</p>
<p>Recency: For a past performance evaluation to be considered recent, the contract should be performed or have been completed within the two years from this solicitation issue date: The offeror shall provide a list of the most recent and relevant past and present contracts in the area of Graphics Visual Media Support performed for Government agencies and commercial customers within two years from this solicitation issue date. Limited to five contract actions.</p>
<p>5.0 Price Evaluation: For the purpose of selecting the successful offeror, technical ability and past performance are considered significantly more important than price. While Price will not be evaluated in terms of acceptable/unacceptable or assigned a confidence rating, as is the technical ability and past performance criteria, it will be evaluated in terms of fairness and reasonableness. After the technical ability and past performance evaluation factors have been completed, price will be evaluated to determine the combination most advantageous to the Government. The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced proposal based on the integrated best value award assessment. Unrealistically low price proposals, as part of the initial proposal, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition.</p>
<p>5.1 This criterion evaluates the overall price to the Government and determines the proposed price is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>5.2 Proposed prices will be evaluated to determine if prices are unreasonably high or low in relation to the Government's independent price estimate and other offeror's proposed prices received in response to the solicitation.</p>
<p>5.3 One or more of the following techniques may be used to perform price analysis:</p>
<p>5.3.1 Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation.</p>
<p>5.3.2 Comparison of prior prices paid by the Government with current proposed prices for the same or similar end items.</p>
<p>5.3.3 Comparison with competitive published price lists, published market prices of commodities, similar indexes, and discount or rebate arrangements.</p>
<p>5.3.4 Comparison of proposed prices with independent Government cost estimates. Proposals unrealistically high or low in cost or price, when compared to the Government estimate may be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of understanding of risks of the solicitation requirement and may result in proposal rejection.</p>
<p>6.0 Competitive range: The Government also reserves the right to limit, for purposes of efficiency, the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. If the contracting officer decides that an offeror's proposal should no longer be included in the competitive range, the proposal shall be eliminated from consideration for award and written notice of the decision shall be provided to the unsuccessful offeror in accordance with FAR 15.503.<br /><br />The Following Provisions and/or Clauses apply to this acquisition:<br />FAR 52.204-10 Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards<br />FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors- Commercial Items<br />FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items<br />FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items<br />FAR 52.212-5 (Dev) Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items including subparagraphs<br />FAR 52.219-6 Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside<br />FAR 52.219-28 Post-Award Small Business Program Representation<br />FAR 52.222-3 Convict Labor<br />FAR 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities<br />FAR 52-222-26 Equal Opportunity<br />FAR 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities <br />FAR 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965<br />FAR 52.222-42 Statement of Equivalent Rates for Federal Hire -- Supplemented per following addenda: In compliance with the Service Contract Act of 1965, this clause identifies the wages and fringe benefits payable to each employee if they were employed by the contracting agency subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5341 or 5332. <br />Employee Class: GS-11 <br />Monetary Wage/Fringe Benefits: $25.25/hour<br />FAR 52.222-50 Combating Trafficking in Persons<br />FAR 52.223-18 Contractor Policy to Ban Text Messaging While Driving<br />FAR 52.225-13 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases<br />FAR 52.233-3 Protest after Award<br />FAR 52.233-4 Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim<br />DFARS 252.203-7000 Requirements Relating to Compensation of Former DoD Officials<br />DFARS 252.212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items<br />DFARS 252.225-7001 Buy American Act and Balance of Payments Program<br />DFARS 252.225-7036 Buy American Act- Free Trade Agreements- Balance of Payments Program<br />DFARS 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports<br />DFARS 252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments</p>

<p><strong><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</strong></p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.

The following are the questions and the Government answers (1 through 26):1.	Question:	Do the 1 margin and 12 characters (minimum) per inch limitsapply to the SF330 form portion of the submittal?  The form we typically use has narrowermargins and takes a smaller font in order to be able to get all the information on thepage for each section?Answer: 	The SF330 form is exempt from the margin and character size limits;follow the SF330 instructions for input into this form.  The 1 margin and 12 characterper inch limits are applicable to pages formatted by the Architect/Engineering firm.  Theunit of characters per inch is associated with mono spaced fonts such as Courier where12 characters per inch is equivalent to 10 point font.	Use a legible font of size 10point or larger.2.	Question:	We are familiar with the SF330 form but wanted to inquire ifNASA/KSC has a version they have on line they would like firms that are submitting touse?Answer: 	There is no NASA/KSC specific version, use the standard form.  The SF330form is available from multiple online government sources.  One source is from the U.S.General Services Administration website: http://contacts.gsa.gov/webforms.nsf/0/21DBF5BF7E860FC185256E13005C6AA6/$file/SF%20330.pdf3.	Question:	We understand the subcontracting goals for the IDIQ include abreakdown of various types of small businesses.  What is the total percentage smallbusiness type subcontracting goal for this solicitation?   In reviewing the breakdown ofthe percentages listed by each small business type on page 5 it could have differentinterpretations for the goal.  Is it a total of 9% SB participation or the combination ofthe breakdown percentages?  Please clarify.Answer: The recommended Small Business subcontracting goal for the overall IDIQ contract(base and all options) is 9%.4.

Question:	Please clarify what the solicitation means by 12 characters perinch. Do you mean to say 12pt. font?

<DESC>Question:&nbsp; Question: Are you able to share the last couple of quarterly reports from the present vendor or just tell us how many people participated so we can get an idea of participation.
<p>ANSWER:the following to the number of active duty tobacco users at Langley. This number is 1,518 from a total 7,774.This data reflect the Air Force population. I notice vendors keeps using the phrase "eligible soldiers", I do not have any data on Soldiers. I want to make sure this vendor understands that this is strictly for the Langley Health &amp; Wellness Center.</p>

<DESC>NOTE: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION&nbsp;HAS BEEN UPDATED<br /><br />Personnel Recovery Recapitalization Program (HH-60 Recap)
<p>Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request For Information (CRFI)</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION <br />The Air Force is in advanced planning to acquire a Personnel Recovery (PR) Recapitalization aircraft to replace the current United States Air Force (USAF) HH-60G fleet. The AF is only interested in full air vehicle systems solutions at this time. To assist in this planning, the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), ASC/WISV, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request for Information (SSS/CRFI) to obtain market insight into potential solutions and sources capable of meeting the requirements of the approved Capability Development Document (CDD).</p>
<p>It is anticipated the United States Air Force will replace an estimated 112 HH-60G air vehicles. Contract award is anticipated to be in FY12. Meeting an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) by the end of FY15 is desired. FY15 IOC requires delivery of eight (8) aircraft with training systems and support in place (initial spares, support equipment, technical data). Describe the capabilities your solution can meet and describe the cost and schedule needed to meet all the capabilities. If a respondent has more than one solution to discuss, a separate response for each is desired. Respondents must describe their solutions' compatibility and comparability to the given capabilities; provide rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost estimates, delivery schedules, and other technical information of potential solutions. <br /><br />This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this SSS/CRFI. This SSS/CRFI is part of ongoing Government conducted market research for planning purposes. It is NOT a solicitation. The Government will not provide reimbursement for costs associated with this request. Responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal. The submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the US Government and will not be returned. Such information will be reviewed by a team comprised of Government as well as contractor personnel hired to provide technical assistance for the Government's preparation of an acquisition approach. All members of the team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent permitted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, Government members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. All contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts and non-disclosure agreements. The Government will determine whether its contractor team members have any organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information. The Government will not reply to information received. The Government anticipates conducting one-on-one discussions with respondents. For planning purposes, the Government is targeting November 2010 for these meetings.</p>
<p>PURPOSE <br />The purpose of this SSS/CRFI is to (1) update the responses to March 2010 Personnel Recovery Recapitalization Program (HH-60 Recap) Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request for Information (CRFI); (2) to engage industry a second time based on updated information; (3) to identify sources and capability that can meet a desired Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY15 if a contract award is made in FY12; and (4) to assist the Air Force in planning and ascertaining schedule, cost and technical risk associated with acquisition of the HH-60 Recap air vehicle. The information respondents submit may be used to develop an acquisition approach. The information in this SSS/CRFI is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to any formal release of an RFP. The Mission Profile, Standard Configuration Load (SCL) and Capabilities have been updated from the original March 2010 SSS/CRFI.<br /><br />RESPONSE GUIDANCE <br />Information received as a result of this request will be considered sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company proprietary information contained in the response should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, such that &lsquo;publicly-releasable' and &lsquo;proprietary' information are clearly distinguished. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one responder to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>SSS/CRFI responses should include a Cover page containing identification of the company Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, street address, and large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone) designation for North American Industry Classification System (NACICS) code 336411 (aircraft manufacturing) and the names and telephone numbers of the technical Point of Contact (POC) and the overall company POC (in the case of a partnership, please provide appropriate CAGE codes and POC information for the lead company).</p>
<p>Responses are limited to 30 pages and must be received by 1300 Eastern Time 27 Oct 2010. Responses must be submitted via eight (8) hard copies with a CD copy in text searchable Portable Document Format (.pdf). Responses should be sent to the Contracting Officer, Jim Dinwoody, ASC/WISK, james.dinwoody@wpafb.af.mil, 1895 Fifth Street, Building 46, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7233.</p>

<DESC><p>The CLS Sustainment Division (formerly 727 ACSG). This is a Request for Information (RFI) only, as part of a market research. The CLS Sustainment Division is seeking to identify sources that may be capable of providing Site Maintenance to include depot support and aircraft modifications and Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) for approximately 47 C-21A aircraft. In addition, the Government is seeking industry input regarding the possible scenarios presented below. There is no solicitation package available at this time. All interested parties should send company and/or descriptive literature along with responses to the following questions and any comments or questions to Mr. Samuel McDuffey, e-mail: samuel.mcduffey@tinker.af.mil. All responses should be received no later than 3:00 PM CST, 1 October 2010. All questions and comments must be in writing, no telephone calls. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.</p>
<p>The government is looking at the possibility of awarding a Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) contract to provide site maintenance, Contract Operated Maintained Base Supply (COMBS), Contract Field Team (CFT), and modification installation support for 47 aircraft at 10 different sites (8 CONUS, 1 OCONUS, 1 deployed). This breakout would include COMBS support only for 19 aircraft at 3 CONUS sites and full CLS maintenance for the remaining aircraft. The 3 CONUS sites have experienced higher parts consumption rates than anticipated. The government has limited usage data, but history is not a predictor of future events. The government does not own any spares or support equipment, therefore it would be the responsibility of the contractor to provide.</p>
<p>There is a possibility that a drawdown will take place which would remove the COMBS support only requirement for the 19 aircraft at 3 CONUS sites starting FY12, 4th Qtr. The reduction may include quarterly reductions in aircraft with one site closing at the end of FY13, 1st Qtr, and the two other sites closing at the end of FY13, 4th Qtr. There is no known probable reduction for the remaining 28 aircraft or closure of any other sites for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><strong>General Questions</strong><br />1) Do you currently provide Aircraft Maintenance and Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) to customers who operate small business jets?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) If so, how many locations, number of aircraft, and model aircraft do you support?</p>
<p>2) Has your company had experience (in the past 5 years) providing Aircraft Maintenance and COMBS to a fleet of business type jet aircraft in excess of 45 aircraft in multiple locations?</p>
<p>3) Has your company had experience (in the past 5 years) providing only COMBS support for military maintainers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Did you face any challenges?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) If so, what challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?</p>
<p>4) Has your company had experience (in the past 5 years) providing Aircraft Maintenance and COMBS outside of the continental United States and its territories? Where was that customer located?</p>
<p>5) Assuming the scope of work does not change, how long of a period of performance can you accurately project your costs?</p>
<p>6) How long is your typical contractual arrangement established with vendors and subcontractors?</p>
<p>7) Do you have the ability to perform engineering service capability on a commercial derivative Lear Jet 35A i.e. C-21A</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) What limitations of engineering support if any would you have?</p>
<p>8) What are your thoughts on this effort being a total small business set-aside?</p>
<p>9) The Government is contemplating a service contract, NAICS Code 488190, what category does your company fall within; small business, veteran-owned small business, small disadvantaged business, Certified 8A, Hub Zone small business, women-owned small business, large business?</p>
<p>10) What previous experience does your company have with Government contracts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Is your company familiar with the Government processes of contracting, billing, engineering, etc.?</p>
<p>11) If you had previous contracts with the Government, what types of pricing arrangement were used?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) What type of pricing arrangement would you recommend for the contract?</p>
<p>12) What does your company specialize in?</p>
<p><strong>In an effort to plan for a possible drawdown, the government has come up with several scenarios. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Scenario #1. The government anticipates the award of a 5-year contract (1-year base w/4 one year option periods) beginning on or about FY13, 1st Qtr. This scenario places the new contractor in a situation where they could possibly be required to stand up and shut down one CONUS site within the first few months of award and the other two CONUS sites within the first ten months of award. The three sites having 19 aircraft would require COMBS support only; keeping in mind the contractor would be required to purchase/lay-in of all spares and parts. Additionally upon award the contractor would be required to provide COMBS and Aircraft Maintenance to 4 other CONUS sites, 1 OCONUS, and 1 deployed site for 28 aircraft. The government will not provide support equipment, spares or parts.</strong></p>
<p>13) What challenges would the contractor face if required to stand up and shut down sites in this timeframe while maintaining the requirements for the stable fleet of 28 aircraft? Please include cost, schedule and other challenges that pertain to supply inventory, personnel hiring, support equipment, overhead management, etc. How would the contractor handle these challenges?</p>
<p>14) What other recommendations/approaches can you offer that would provide USAF insight that would result in successful Contractor Logistic Services COMBS effort for these 19 aircraft?</p>
<p>15) What are your recommendations and/or concerns with this scenario?</p>
<p>16) Are there any concerns regarding this period of performance?</p>
<p>17) Provide any other comments you have for this 5-year scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario #2. The government anticipates the award of a 5-year contract (1-year base w/4 one year option periods) beginning on or about 1 October 2012. For COMBS and Aircraft Maintenance for 28 aircraft at 4 CONUS, 1 OCONUS, and 1 deployed site. In this scenario, there is no expectation of aircraft drawdown. The government will not provide support equipment, spares or parts.</strong></p>
<p>18) What challenges would the contractor face with this scenario? Please include cost, schedule and others challenges that pertain to supply inventory, personnel hiring, support equipment, etc. How would the contractor handle these challenges?</p>
<p>19) What other recommendations/approaches can you offer that would provide USAF insight that would result in successful Contractor Logistic Services COMBS and Aircraft Maintenance effort for these aircraft?</p>
<p>20) What are your recommendations and/or concerns with this source selection?</p>
<p>21) Are there any concerns regarding this period of performance?</p>
<p>22) Provide any other comments you have for this 5-year scenario.</p>
<p>23) Do you foresee a significant savings between scenario 2 versus scenario 1? If so please explain and illustrate how the government could benefit from such savings, for example cost savings, program success, streamline processes etc.</p>
<p>24) In reference to the two previous options presented please provide an assessment to each for probable success using the following scale:</p>
<p>1= high probability not to succeed without relief of requirements to 10 being high a probability of success with little to no duress to the contractor or the government</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Scenario 1 High Risk 1-------------5------------10 Low Risk<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Scenario 2 High Risk 1-------------5------------10 Low Risk</p>
<p><strong>Scenario #3. The government anticipates the award of a 2-year bridge contract (1-year base w/4 quarterly option periods) beginning approximately 1 October 2011. This scenario places the contractor in a situation where they would be required to provide short term COMBS support (10 months to 2 years) at the 3 closing sites for 19 aircraft and simultaneously maintain Aircraft Maintenance and COMBS support for 28 aircraft located at 4 additional CONUS sites, 1 OCONUS, and 1 deployed site. The government will not provide support equipment, spares or parts.</strong></p>
<p>25) What challenges would the contractor face if required to stand up and shut down sites in this timeframe, (2 years or less)? Please include cost, schedule and others challenges that pertain to supply inventory, personnel hiring, support equipment, etc. How would the contractor handle these challenges?</p>
<p>26) Do you foresee your organization desiring to participate in such an endeavor as this 2-year scenario? If so what challenges does this short term contract present for the contractor? Please include cost, schedule and other challenges that would pertain to this scenario.</p>
<p>27) Do you foresee being able to economically amortize your capital investment of this scenario over the 2-year period or should the government expect an above normal cost due to the contract term and activity? Please provide a detailed explanation of your response.</p>
<p>28) What other recommendations /approaches can you offer that would provide USAF insight that would result in successful Contractor Logistic Services COMBS and Aircraft Maintenance effort for these aircraft?</p>
<p>29) What are your recommendations and/or concerns with this source selection?</p>
<p>30) Are there any concerns regarding this period of performance?</p>
<p>31) Provide any other comments you have for the 2-year scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Questions<br /><br /></strong>32) What advantages/disadvantages do you perceive for using a FAR Part 12, firm-fixed priced contract?</p>
<p>33) Provide any other commercial suggestions or approaches to fulfilling this requirement.</p>
<p>This is an amendment to Request for Information (RFI), RFI-C21-CLS, issued on 22 Sep 2010, as part of market research. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. All responses to this amendment are requested by 1 Oct 2010.</p>
<p>Additional questions are added to RFI-C21-CLS as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Considering Scenario #1. In addition the Government may choose to reserve the right to make two separate awards. The first award may include full CLS support for 28 aircraft for a 1-year base with four 1-year option period contract. The second award may be for COMBS only support for 19 aircraft for approximately one year (FY13), which would include the probable drawdown of all aircraft mentioned in the third paragraph of the original RFI.<br /></strong><br />34) Would you be interested in the contract that would support the 28 aircraft with full CLS for five years? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>35) Would you be interested in the contract that would support the 19 aircraft with COMBS only for approximately one year? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>36) Would the possibility of two separate awards affect your proposal? If so, how? Would it affect pricing also?</p>

<DESC>2010 TARDEC Survivability Market Survey<BR><BR>OBJECTIVES:<BR><BR>US Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC) is conducting a market survey to identify technologies that provides occupant protection and ground vehicle survivability.<BR><BR>The intent is to identify state of the art occupant protection and vehicle survivability systems through a self-assessment made by each respective participant. A system may be a single technology or a combination of technologies and must be minimally at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 (see Table I).<BR><BR>DESIRED CAPABILITIES<BR><BR>The Army seeks to enhance current and future Ground System survivability by providing threat detection, hit/kill prevention, and protection for the crew, passenger, and vehicle, while preserving vehicle payload, mobility, fuel efficiency, and Reliability, Availability, Maintainability-Durability (RAM-D) capabilities. Emphasis will be placed on survivability technologies that demonstrate the ability to be scalable, modular, and easily integrated onto a military vehicle. Affordability, minimal weight, and small space claim are key attributes. It is desired that the multiple technologies chosen will be integrated to provide a synergistic protective effect and not simply a cumulative effect of layering individual technology capabilities. The following are attributes the Army is seeking to include:<BR><BR>a. 360 hemispherical, lightweight crew and passenger compartment protection from armor piercing direct fire <BR>b. Lightweight crew and passenger compartment protection from blast events and fragmentation, including both side and underside threats<BR>c. Incoming threat detection and notification (i.e. sniper fire, RPGs, etc.)<BR>d. Survivability technologies to address Improvised Explosive Device or Explosive Ordnance Disposal (IED/EOD)<BR>e. Technologies to suppress/mitigate both internal and external vehicle fires.<BR>f. Non-Lethal technology that could be used for crowd control or to subdue individuals without causing permanent injury<BR>g. Safety applications to enhance crew survivability, including seat restraints, specialized seat configurations, rapid egress technologies, crew compartment coating to cushion soldier impact from vertical/lateral acceleration<BR>h. Soldier 360o hemispherical visualization during day and night operations and in all weather and environmental conditions (sand, dust, rain, etc.)<BR>i. Hazardous agent detection within operating environment<BR>j. Technologies that defend against RPGs, ATGMs, and/or EFPs<BR>k. Signature Management technologies or designs that reduce the thermal, acoustic, or RF signature of the vehicle system<BR>l. Other technologies that enhance crew, passenger, and system survivability, excluding automotive components that impact mobility and technologies used to aid tactical planning<BR><BR><BR>RESPONSES: <BR><BR>The submission period has been extended from 28 October 2010 to 12 November 2010. The Government will begin technology analysis following the submission period. Please address any questions regarding this market survey via email to dami_tardecmarketsurvey@conus.army.mil and include name, phone, and email address for response. Questions may be answered via email or phone.<BR><BR>Submit all responses up to DOD SECRET data on a DVD in MS Word format via registered mail to: <BR><BR>Inner Label: Outer Package Label: <BR><BR>US Army RDECOM/TARDEC US Army RDECOM/TARDEC<BR>6501 E.

(NOTE: All non-security related questions should be sent to dami_tardecmarketsurvey@conus.army.mil.) Participation in this market survey is completely voluntary. If the Government seeks additional information that is not included in a submittal, TARDEC representatives may contact the participant for further information exchange. Information developed as part of this market survey will be shared with US Army Research, Development Engineering Command (RDECOM) subordinate commands, and Program Executive Office for Combat Support and Combat Service Support (PEO CS&CSS) Project Manager for Tactical Vehicles (PM TV), Project Manager for Future Tactical Systems (PM FTS) (Provisional), and Other Government Agencies (OGAs) (e.g.. Office of Naval Research, Marine Corps, etc.).<BR><BR><BR>GENERAL INFORMATION: <BR>The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as confidential under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term confidential in the context of Classified Information, we will use the term PROPRIETARY.] Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following: <BR><BR>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) PROPRIETARY with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <BR><BR>2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as PROPRIETARY may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<BR><BR>3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data.<BR><BR>4. Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the PROPRIETARY legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS: and PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS.<BR><BR>5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<BR><BR>6. The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondents marking of data as PROPRIETARY will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.<BR>MISCELLANEOUS:<BR>No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking participants to be placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on information requests. Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned. A separate response for each system or technology is desired.<BR><BR><BR>Survivability Market Survey Questionnaire<BR><BR>1.

The Air Force Health Facilities Division is responsible for the programming, planning, design, construction, and initial outfitting of new and renovated USAF medical treatment facilities worldwide. They are chartered with modernizing hospitals, clinics, medical office buildings, warehouses, vet clinics and wellness centers. To meet the Initial Outfitting requirements, the AFMS/HFD requires a contracting vehicle that utilizes experienced suppliers/vendors who are able to rapidly respond to multiple requirements, meet constrained project schedules and provide a variety of products and IO services from planning through warranty. This contract vehicle will enable the Air Force to standardize execution, minimize acquisition lead times and costs, work multiple projects concurrently and complete projects on schedule. Under this contract, the IO contractor shall provide: 1) initial outfitting transition (IO-T) services associated with a military construction project and/or 2) provide all initial outfitting (IO) commodities to outfit new or newly renovated medical facilities such as hospitals, clinics, medical administration buildings, ambulatory health facilities, medical warehouses, medical laboratories, biological engineering laboratories, dental clinics, veterinary clinics, wellness centers, and any other buildings connected to/associated with health facilities. <BR><BR>The contract will be performed in two steps:  Step 1 shall be Initial Outfitting Transition (IO-T), including project management, transition/relocation planning, planning/design and technical support, product selection/planning, inventory identification, storage, movers, supervision, and budget development, tracking and adherence.  Step 2 includes procurement of the product, installation labor, transportation, tools, materials, storage and freight, case goods, furniture and furnishings equipment, artwork, signage, information technology/communication and resource protection systems.

<p>JUSTIFICATION REVIEW DOCUMENT<br /><br />JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>I. Contracting Organization: <br />Department of the Air Force<br />Air Force Materiel Command<br />Aeronautical Systems Center<br />Medium Altitude UAS Division<br />2640 Loop Road West, Rm. 213<br />Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7106</p>
<p>II. Description of Action: <br />This Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) is for acquisition of services to tailor the Raytheon Solypsis Tactical Display Framework (TDF) software's user interface for sense and avoid applications. The TDF software is used to identify all aircraft and weather issues at Det 3 OL.</p>
<p>III. Description of Services:</p>
<p>The MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper weapon systems are unmanned, multi-role systems capable of operating over the horizon while providing armed reconnaissance, attack and near real-time intelligence information to the Joint Task Force Commander as well as vital 24-hour surveillance and Close Air Support (CAS) coverage for ground forces supporting critical national security objectives.</p>
<p>The MQ-1 and MQ-9 are dynamically re-taskable weapon systems able to rapidly transition between reconnaissance, surveillance, target acquisition and attack missions. They adapt to all aspects of the "kill chain" (find, fix, track, target, engage and assess) for time-sensitive targeting. The MQ-1 Predator operates at medium altitudes and the MQ-9 Reaper at medium to high altitudes, integrating with joint air and space forces, as well as coalition and Allied Forces, to execute the Combatant Commander's priorities.</p>
<p>The services being procured under this J&amp;A include unique and sensitive requirements to modify the current Raytheon Solypsis system focusing on tailoring the TDF user interface for sense and avoid application for the system located at the Medium Altitude UAS Division - Det 3 Operating Locations (OL) at Gray Butte, CA. This system needs to be compatible with our other Solypsis TDF system at Creech AFB at Las Vegas, NV. Raytheon Solypsis is the designer, developer, and manufacturer of this software.</p>
<p><br />IV. Authority:<br />Regulation 10 USC 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>V. Applicability of Authority:</p>
<p>The Raytheon Solipsys Tactical Display Framework software is currently is in use at both Grey Butte Test Facility and at Creech Air Force Base. Raytheon Solipsys is the designer, developer, and manufacturer of the TDF software and is the only known source to obtain the required services. The TDF software is proprietary software of Raytheon Solipsys and they have no know authorized dealers, partners, or re-sellers which can provide these services.</p>
<p>Based upon the above information, Raytheon Solipsys is the only company capable of meeting the government's requirement.</p>
<p>VI. Efforts to Obtain Competition:<br />The TDF software in need of tailoring is proprietary to Raytheon Solipsys; therefore, no efforts were made to obtain competition from other sources.</p>
<p>VII. Fair and Reasonable Costs:<br />The required services can be procured under the Raytheon Solipsys' GSA schedule. The rates on GSA schedules have already been determined fair and reasonable. A technical evaluation of the proposed hours will be completed prior to negotiations and award. There is a small amount of travel required for the effort; it will be reviewed to ensure it is compliant with the JTR.</p>
<p>VIII. Market Research:<br />ASC/WII Det 3 performed informal market analysis to determine that Raytheon Solipsys was the only available source to complete the required services. Continued market research and monitoring will be performed to determine the existence of other potential sources.</p>
<p>IX. Other Facts:<br />None</p>
<p>X. Interested Sources:<br />This requirement has not been made available to other contractors due to proprietary restrictions; therefore, there are no other interested sources.</p>
<p>XI. Steps to Foster Competition:<br />None</p>
<p>XII. Contracting Officer's (CO) Certification:<br />The CO's signature on the J&amp;A evidences she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of her knowledge and belief.</p>
<p><br />XIII. Technical Requirements Personnel's Certification:<br />As evidenced by their signatures on the J&amp;A signature page, the technical and/or requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility, is both accurate and complete.</p>
