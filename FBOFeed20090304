<p>PART I INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Campus Challenge problem solving competition is an effort sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory's Munitions Directorate. The purpose of the competition is to solicit innovative, potentially paradigm-shifting ideas that have the potential, upon maturity, to successfully address specific real-world problems of interest to the Air Force research community. This is accomplished through direct competition, ultimately among a small number of participants. Campus Challenge is a recurring event that could feature a different selection of participants each time. But the charter will always be the same-a challenge to match wits in devising solutions to real problems through the advent of new technology.</p>
<p>This is the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) of the Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW) under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs.</p>
<p>PART II RESEARCH PROBLEM STATEMENT</p>
<p>TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGES FOR MINIATURE SELF-DEPLOYING SYSTEMS (MSDS) IN CLUTTERED/CONFINED ENVIRONMENTS</p>
<p>The Urban/Cluttered environment represents an area that has captured military interest in recent years. Traditional aerospace research has focused on speed, precision, endurance, and stealth. However, the possibility of operating miniature systems in this environment brings about new challenges.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Munitions Directorate would be able to bring to maturation all the technologies necessary to allow the US Air Force to confidently pursue the development of a constellation of multi-agent platforms (operating in the air and/or the ground) that can maneuver autonomously. These constellations should be able to maneuver in the open or inside of structures.<br />These maneuvering systems need to be able to provide diverse capabilities to the war-fighter. They may be called upon for search and rescue tasks. The systems may be used to find and identify hazardous materials. They may be employed to detect and identify electronic devices such as computers, radars, or communication systems.</p>
<p>These miniature systems would presumably have the following characteristics:<br />a. Can be air-delivered to the vicinity of a target.<br />b. Can enter the target area autonomously - either airborne or on the ground<br />c. Can operate without recourse to Global Positioning System (GPS) assistance<br />d. Can accommodate a variety of payloads - sensors and/or target neutralization devices<br />e. Possess or have access to enough power to successfully execute the mission<br />f. Can communicate with each other or to a remote monitoring station<br />g. Can be self-disabling and tamper-proof at the mission's conclusion</p>
<p>Size is a consideration. It is desired that these systems be as small as possible while still being able to have the attributes stated above. It is not a necessity that these systems be re-useable after their given mission is complete. But that re-use capability would be advantageous. Therefore, system cost must also be a consideration.</p>
<p>The thrust of this problem statement is to provide the following:<br />1. Identify the key technologies that need to be developed to satisfy each of those seven characteristics. Some of the technologies may already be available.<br />2. Identify the current maturity level of each of those technologies.<br />3. Ultimately, provide a comprehensive technology investment roadmap in which the Munitions Directorate may choose to invest. This investment roadmap would be the most efficient path to follow to bring the required technologies to the requisite maturity level for sub-system integration and demonstration. Time to develop and cost to develop are both factors.</p>
<p>This statement of the problem is intentionally vague so the Munitions Directorate can solicit "out-of-the-box" thinking rather than rehashing already-established concepts. With that understanding, please think in terms of satisfying the envisioned missions of these systems as opposed to any specific characteristic that might not be germane to a truly novel approach.</p>
<p>PART III CAMPUS CHALLENGE PROCEDURES</p>
<p>This competition is divided into four phases: Letters of Intent, White Papers, Proposal Submissions and Campus Challenge Winner Selection.</p>
<p>Phase I -- Letters of Intent: <br />All students (undergraduate or graduate) and faculty of universities are eligible and encouraged to participate. The goal is to produce the best possible solution to the stated problem regardless of who participates. Participation from various universities and departments within the university is encouraged. The universities may team with industry partners, however, the university must take the lead. Only one letter of intent per university team should be submitted.</p>
<p>The letter must be received by 4:00pm CST 15 April 2009.</p>
<p>The letter shall include a synopsis of the proposed idea. All teams intending to participate must submit a one-page, single spaced letter of intent to AFRL/RWK (see the address in Part V below). The letters will be reviewed by the RW Campus Challenge Review Panel, and approximately ten teams will be selected to submit a follow-up white paper.</p>
<p>The criteria for this initial down select will be technological innovation and likelihood of successful system-level development within a nominal 8- to 12-year timeframe, as evaluated by Campus Challenge Review Panel. The selected participants will be informed and invited to attend a meeting to be held at or near Eglin AFB, FL to discuss the problem and the competition requirements in greater detail prior to their submission of white papers. Those not selected will be notified.</p>
<p>Phase II -- White Paper: <br />In Phase II the participants will be selected to submit a white paper. The anticipated date selecting the white paper participants is 31 May 09. The white paper is the most important factor in the Phase II competition. It should be specific and complete. All of the technical factors do not need to be addressed in the white paper, but the following should be included and emphasized accordingly in the white paper:</p>
<p>(1) Demonstrate a thorough understanding of the Problem requirements.</p>
<p>(2) Describe the proposed technical approaches to comply with the requirements specified in the Problem.</p>
<p>(3) Particular emphasis should be directed toward identifying existing or emerging technologies that may be used singularly or in combination to provide an innovative means to solve the Problem. All technologies or suggested approaches should be available for advanced or system-level development by the Air Force within the next 8- to 12-years after completion of this effort.</p>
<p>Preparation of White Paper: <br />The anticipated date for submission of white papers to AFRL/RWK is 15 Jan 2010. The white paper shall be limited to 10 pages or less, including title page, narrative, tables, figures, and references. A page is defined to be one side of an 8.5 x 11-inch piece of paper with information on it. Print size is no smaller than 10-point type in Arial or Times New Roman. All white papers must be submitted in hard copy and electronic media (CD-ROM or e-mail) in MS Word or Portable Document File (PDF) format directly to addresses listed in Part V. On the cover page, reference the BAA number and you CAGE and DUNS codes. To do business with the Air Force Research Laboratory/Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW), you must have software packages that are compatible with Microsoft Office 2007. Ten paper copies of the white paper shall be submitted; each must bear the signatures, names and departments of those persons who actively participated. No Air Force funding is available for preparation of the white papers or follow-on proposals.</p>
<p>Basis for Evaluation of White Papers: <br />The Campus Challenge Review Panel will be composed of Air Force scientists and technical experts. This team may call upon other government resources for analysis, evaluation, modeling, or costing expertise. Two white papers will be selected as Phase II winners and requests for proposals will be sent to these winners. Evaluation criteria are in Part VI of this BAA.</p>
<p>Phase III -- Proposal Submission: <br />In Phase III, two participants will be selected to submit a proposal. The anticipated date for the Government's Request For Proposals (RFP) is 15 Mar 2010; proposals will be due 15 May 2010. The winners will be asked to submit proposals for a Development Plan describing how the Air Force could most efficiently develop the ideas presented in their respective white papers. Two awards are anticipated to be issued with the estimated amount for each award to be not less than $150,000. However, the government reserves the right to decline award and either proceed with fewer projects or request a proposal from among the original white paper submittals.</p>
<p>Preparation of Proposal: <br />Proposal Preparation instructions are defined in PART V of this BAA.</p>
<p>Basis for Evaluation of Proposal: <br />Evaluation criteria are in Part VI of this BAA.</p>
<p>Phase IV - Campus Challenge Winner Selection<br />Approximately eight months after the contract is awarded, each participant shall deliver a well-structured development plan. These development plans shall, as a minimum, consist of a technology investment roadmap, a development and transition schedule, and a detailed cost estimate. Their purpose shall be to provide the Air Force with a comprehensive strategy whereby the least amount of Government dollars can be best invested to provide all of the technologies necessary to realize the Problem solution within a nominal 8- to 12-year development period. Emphasis shall be placed on developing technologies with a high likelihood of successful transition to Air Force systems at the end of this period. Hence, an investment roadmap that merely recommends extended research grants would be unacceptable. The development plans shall include specific suggestions as to domestic technology vendors. Emphasis should be placed in two areas. The first is the innovative application of emerging technologies to solve the Problem. The second area of emphasis should be placed on describing a transition strategy that moves a technology from laboratory experiment to a viable system. The system should be at a level of maturity so that the Air Force can begin to integrate them into actual sub-system or prototype demonstrations at the end of the 8- to 12- year period, if not sooner. The Air Force reserves the right to accept, reject, or modify some or all of the recommendations presented in either or both development plans and is under no obligation to fund the implementation of the development plan. The Air Force will ultimately evaluate each of these two development plans and determine an overall Phase IV Campus Challenge winner. The overall winner will be notified, and will be presented the "Okaloosa Sword."</p>
<p>Basis for Determining the Campus Challenge Winner: <br />The Campus Challenge Review Panel will determine the Challenge winner by evaluating the Phase IV development plans using the following factors in descending order of importance: feasibility, technology maturity, transition strategy, and Air Force investment cost (these evaluation criteria are similar to the criteria used for proposal evaluation). Feasibility is the Air Force assessment of the probability that the proposed solution will be successful. Technology maturity is the Air Force assessment of the degree of investment risk associated with a particular technology. Transition strategy is the step-by-step process that will logically mature a technology to the point that it becomes a viable component within a larger system. Investment cost is the total Air Force funding on a year-to-year basis that would be required to provide the requisite mature technology and to transition it to the point that it could be successfully demonstrated at the integrated system level. All proprietary technology or data, whether in a white paper, proposal, or development plan, should be clearly labeled. The winning development plan will be the one that clearly and simply provides the more credible, preferably less expensive, means to arrive at an effective solution to the problem for one or more munitions applications. It should be noted that tangible, proof-of-concept demonstrations that serve to verify a competitor's overall concept are encouraged. These successful technology demonstrations would enhance the Air Force's confidence in the feasibility of a given approach.</p>

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for an acquisition for which the Defense Distribution Center, New Cumberland, PA intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for Optical Memory Laser Cards.  The cards are used as part of an Automated Manifest System.  These cards have the capability to hold 1200 pages of information, and can withstand the harshest military conditions without any loss of data.

General Dynamics Information Technology Inc. is the only source that can provide these cards due to the proprietary nature of the Automated Manifest System.  Any attempt to develop an alternate source to provide this system, if possible, would result in a substantial cost to the Government.  Accordingly, the Government intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price purchase order (FFP) utilizing FAR Part 13 to General Dynamics Information Technology Inc. for the Optical Memory Laser Cards.

Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The delivery date will be 30 days after receipt of the order.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 326130 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. 

All responsible sources may respond by submitting qualifications/capabilities of the company to provide the Optical Memory Laser Cards by 4:00 PM EDT, 19 MARCH 2009 to Daniel Herring, Acquisition Operations, DDC J7-AB, J Avenue, Bldg 404, New Cumberland, PA 17070, Phone:  717-770-6030, FAX:  717-770-5689, or e-mail:  daniel.herring@dla.mil for consideration by the agency.  If no affirmative responses are received by 4:00 PM EDT, 19 MARCH 2009 to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, a purchase order will be negotiated and awarded to General Dynamics Information Technology.

The accurate determination of caloric effects such as specific heat and enthalpies of phase transitions is required to be performed concurrently with the measurement of mass changes.

Besides the routine (i.e. varying temperature from room temperature to 600 degrees C) simultaneous thermal analysis (STA) experiments that will be done on this instrument, there are a set of Key Experiments that will need to accurately record sample weight loss on heating of solvated materials then having the sample cooled to -150 degrees C under flowing helium gas. Once the sample has reached thermal equilibrium, the sample is exposed to a low flow of hydrogen gas and allowed to further equilibrate. The hydrogen gas must be isolated from the rest of the STA using the helium as a buffer gas and be compatible with any electrical components such as mass-flow controllers or valves. The hydrogen is then swapped back to helium, and the system heated to at least 500 degrees C to record DSC and TGA responses. Since hydrogen is an extremely light molecule and adsorbed in small amounts in most materials of interest at these temperatures, the adsorption/desorption mass changes require extreme sensitivity of the instrument balance.  

Netzsch Instruments , Inc. is the only contractor who can provide a simultaneous thermal analyzer that meets both the routine requirements as well as the requirements for the set of key experiments.  The equipment and technology are proprietary to Netzsch.  Therefore, Netzsch Instruments, Inc. is uniquely qualified to provide the required simultaneous thermal analyzer.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on March 19, 2009.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

Proposed Solicitation Issue Date:  March 19, 2009
Title of Project:  Repair and Maintenance of Historic Concrete and Stone in Maryland, Virginia, District of Columbia and West Virginia
Description:  Work will include analysis of existing conditions, cleaning of existing historic concrete and stone,  replacement-in-kind of portions of historic concrete and stone including but not limited to pavements, stairs, curbs, walls, cornices, benches, patching/repair of spalls and delaminations at concrete elements with an exposed aggregate finish, replication or repair of concrete/stone piers and decorative elements (urns, balusters, obelisks, fountain elements, water spouts, handrails, coping and other pre-formed objects and decorative elements), creation of molds from extant or portions of extant features, repair of concrete/stone with imbedded elements, and repair of cracks in historic concrete and stone.  This would require replication, creation, and/or analysis of concrete mixes and analysis of stone as required.  Work may be vertical or horizontal surfaces.  Repair of modern concrete/stone that is incidental to the historic concrete/stone is also included.  Relevant NAICS codes are 238110, 238120, 238140, and 238190.
Work will potentially occur throughout the National Capital Region.  The National Capital Region (Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia, and West Virginia) contains more than 700 individual sites, ranging from community parks that serve as neighborhood gathering places to national monuments that attract visitors from around the world. Serving more than 40 million visitors annually, the parks of the National Capital Region encompass more than 87,000 acres of parkland and open space with thousands of historic structures and archeological sites, hundreds of miles of trails, bike paths, riverfront, scenic parkways, and historic canals. The National Capital Region also offers visitors numerous statues, presidential memorials, historic forts, Civil War battlefields, and the White House. Despite ongoing repair and maintenance these sites continue to have large amounts of deteriorated stone and exposed aggregate retaining walls, paving, and steps remaining and deterioration of walls and paving continues. The National Park Service (NPS) seeks interest from experts in the stone and concrete industry capable of providing expert advice, formula development services, and ongoing repair of the concrete and stone decorative features.  
In some cases formulas for the concrete mixes for repair have been developed, but the Park has varied concrete within and additional mixes and formulas may need to be developed to match the historic concrete in the color, texture, frequency of specific aggregate colors and size of the historic concrete aggregate and matrix, including, when possible, using materials from the original quarries.  There are slight variations in the same mix for the concrete in different locations; therefore, some adjustment must be made to create samples to match specific locations. Work may include submitting alternate design mixtures when characteristics of materials, project conditions, weather, test results or other circumstances warrant adjustments. Work may include replacement of portions of stone/concrete pavements and stairs, patch repair of spalls (missing, damaged or deteriorated locations) and delaminations at stone and concrete elements with an exposed aggregate finish, and replication or repair of concrete/stone piers and decorative elements, providing steel reinforcement where necessary. Concrete spalls are both shallow and deep, deep spalls being those which have exposed rebar within the spalled area and shallow spalls those with no visible reinforcing (prior to cleaning and preparation for repair). Some repairs may require injection grout and/or repair mortar.  Repair of modern stone and concrete that is incidental to the historic concrete is also included.
EXAMPLES OF WORK: 
Shenandoah National Park, located in Virginia contains 69 historic overlooks located along Skyline Drive.  Improvements of the overlooks are needed as a result of their deteriorating condition.  This includes deterioration of historic stone guardwalls, retaining walls and parking areas at overlooks that has created public safety concerns and diminished overall visitor enjoyment.  Significant character-defining features such as stone curbing, stone-paved drainage structures, stone headwalls, walkways, stone retaining walls and guard walls require restoration and repair.  Historically appropriate dry-laid stone retaining walls would be rebuilt on concrete foundations for a longer lasting solution to the steep slopes.  Significant drainage issues would be corrected by adding culverts, adding weep holes and slightly modifying grades.  Overlooks would be repaved.
Meridian Hill Park is located in Washington, D.C. approximately one and one-half miles north of the White House.  It is one of Washington's most important and historic parks in the tradition of the monumental, federal parks of the Mall. Bounded by 16th Street on the west, Euclid Street on the north, 15th Street on the east and W Street on the south, Meridian Hill Park is located within a diverse and changing neighborhood. Originally envisioned as "a classical villa landscape at the center of a vibrant and interesting residential neighborhood", the park continues to play an important role in the physical as well as social landscape of the neighborhood. Meridian Hill Park was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1994, as "an outstanding accomplishment of early 20th-century Neoclassicist park design in the United States" This significant historic resource was originally created to provide visitors and the citizens of Washington D.C. with a formal garden comparable to the public gardens of Paris, Rome and other foreign capital cities. Among its distinctive architectural features are walks, terraces, pools, fountains, and cascades that were constructed of exposed concrete aggregate, using the pioneering techniques developed by craftsman John Earley.
TYPE OF PROCUREMENT:  NPS anticipates awarding multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contracts to satisfy this need.  The NPS anticipates competing individual task orders for each project among all successful contractors awarded a contract under this solicitation.  Individual task orders will provide information regarding site location, end product results, site restrictions and/or limitations.  Site visits will be highly encouraged.
The term of the IDIQ contract shall be one year with four one-year options.  The total of all task orders for the base and option years for each IDIQ contract awarded will not exceed $10,000,000.00.
Payment and Performance bonds will be required on a per task order award.  The Small Business Administration (SBA) has recently raised the maximum contract amount that can be covered by an SBA guaranteed surety bond from $2 million to $5 million.  Small businesses can find further information regarding SBA bonding on www.SBA.gov.
All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered. 
It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors, (large or small) are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Central Contractor Registration's (CCR) Dynamic Small Business Search for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories. 
In order to be considered for award, all large businesses will be required to submit an acceptable Small, HUBZone Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-owned, Veteran-Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan with their proposal.   The NPS subcontracting goals for the participation of small businesses at a minimum are as follows:  Small Business Concerns - 60%; Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns - 24%; Small Women-Owned Business Concerns - 6%; HUBZone Small Business Concerns - 10%; Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns - 3%; Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business Concerns - 3%; 8(a) concerns - 12%. Small Disadvantaged Business & HUBZone firms must be certified in accordance with solicitation clauses 52.219-8 -- Utilization of Small Business Concerns (May 2004) & 52.219-9 -- Small Business Subcontracting Plan (Jul 2005) (status of firms can be found on CCR's Dynamic SB Search).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Mark J. Toler, Contracting Officer, Phone 9546301166, Fax 9546301165, Email tolermj@state.gov
<DESC>The Government intends to award a noncompetitive Purchase Order using procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1(b) to Safari Group, LLC for Auxiliary Refit Kits for urgent supply and installation on Ecuadorian Piranha shallow-water marine craft, to support Joint Ecuador/US counter narcotics operations.   The materials and associated installation components, and related warranty), from Safari will be donated for use by the government of Ecuador under the Department's international narcotics and law enforcement program. 

This notice is not a request for proposals; this acquisition will be processed using the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b). Justification for other than full and open competition is that the Government requires immediate delivery of the material to refit existing Piranha watercraft in support of the Joint Ecuador/US Counternarcotics Program to apprehend, prosecute and convict criminal elements in Ecuador and only the equipment noted above will suffice. The Government has researched this technology and was unable to find any other companies able to meet the requirements. The required equipment must be compatible and able to interface with the existing watercraft operations in Ecuador. Only the items listed above have been identified to meet these needs.

Solicitation is not available at this time. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to change the acquisition strategy.

The scope and purpose of this IDIQ contract will be to provide full multi-discipline and abbreviated design services for renovation, repair and minor construction projects, as well as to provide construction management services, primarily for projects at Fort Lewis and its sub-installations as well as McChord Air Force Base. Individual Task Orders to be assigned under this contract will identify specific requirements.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: (A) The Architect-Engineer (A-E) shall perform all or part of the following design services, as identified in individual Task Orders: 1. Prosecute the various work features as described hereinafter to the extent set forth in individual Task Orders to be issued hereunder. 2. Utilize Government designs, drawings, specifications, and standards for buildings, structures and other facilities as necessary to meet the requirements of the proposed project. 3. Prepare, subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer, charrettes, preliminary studies, sketches, layout plans, reports and cost estimates of the proposed project. The variety of projects shall include maintenance, repair, alteration and minor construction projects at Fort Lewis and its sub-installations, McChord AFB and projects assigned to Seattle District, USACE. The number of copies of the studies, sketches, plans and reports to be furnished to the Government will be set forth in each individual Task Order. A portion of the designs shall be abbreviated plans and specifications with detailed cost estimates utilizing the Army Job Order Contract (JOC) Computerized Pricing Guide (CPG) WinEst. WinEst is a Windows based RS Means database program designed for IBM PC compatible computers. This CPG system has been selected for use as the cost basis for all work under the JOC and may also be used for negotiated orders under the Fort Lewis Multi Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC). The CPG contains more than 55,000 unit price construction line items for the description of work to be accomplished and for the unit of measure specified. Line item costs will be determined by multiplying the RS Means Bare Costs by the nearest available City Cost Index to localize the bare costs. The localized bare costs are then multiplied by the JOC or MATOC Contractor's coefficient. Cost estimates shall be automated utilizing the latest version of the automated pricing system. Multiple annual databases may be utilized depending on the date estimates are prepared or the terms of the individual JOC and MATOC. Effort may also include supporting government project managers in their negotiations with JOC and MATOC contractors prior to award of construction Task Orders. Designs may also include design-build projects requiring preparation of material takeoffs, bills of materials, and detailed designs. Projects are primarily architectural with related civil, mechanical and electrical work, including some asbestos and lead abatement work. Some examples of projects include: i.

This procurement is a follow-on to the current multiple award CPFF IDIQ contracts for the SMDIS II Program which expire on September 30, 2009.  USASMDC/ARSTRAT anticipates that two or three contracts will be awarded as a result of this 100% small business set-aside.  The resultant contracts will have the capacity to provide support to all Government agencies involved in the Space, Homeland Defense, and Missile Defense arenas and shall support all functional areas of the contract Performance Work Statement (PWS), which include, but are not limited to: vision statements and doctrine; development of architectures; and, program support (e.g., planning, development, fielding documentation, modeling and simulation, system analysis and integration, integrated logistics support, development of strategy, support to the war fighter, contingency and mission support, program oversight, independent verification validation and test evaluation, prototype development, sustainment and operation, and analysis of emerging technologies).  Support shall primarily focus on the five core USASMDC/ARSTRAT mission areas, which are:  Space, Missile Defense, Information Operations, Global Strike and C4ISR.  Potential areas of growth include:  Infrastructure, Organization Analysis, and Evaluations; Intelligence Requirements; Systems Engineering and Systems Integration Analysis; Simulation and Modeling Development; Rapid Prototyping and Limited Development; Software Development, Network Development, and Information Systems Support; Integrated Logistics Support; Emerging Technologies Analysis; Quick Response Support; Meetings and Conference Organization Support; Staff Support; and Blue Force Tracking.  When posted, the draft PWS, draft solicitation, applicable attachments and exhibits, and other historical SMDIS II documents and related information will be posted to Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI).  An initial round of one-on-one meetings were held with industry on November 19 and 20, 2008.  These one-on-one meetings were held as a market research mechanism to help determine best commercial practices, to maximize competition, and achievement of cost efficiencies in the acquisition process.  Questions and answers related to the one-on-one sessions and the draft PWS were not posted or released; however, recommendations that the Government considered relevant were incorporated into the solicitation.  A draft solicitation and associated supporting documents will be posted to ASFI in a follow-on notice.  At that time industry will be provided the opportunity to review the draft documents and specific instructions for providing comments/feedback.  Due to time constraints, a second round of one-on-one sessions will not be held. The final RFP will be posted to the ASFI after consideration and incorporation of relevant feedback/comments.  All interested parties are encouraged to regularly monitor the website for all pertinent acquisition information ASFI will be the official the only means for SMDIS III information dissemination.  The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 541712 and the small business size standard is 1,000 employees.  The resultant contracts will establish a five-year ordering period starting on  October 1, 2009 and ending on September 30, 2014. Individual task order duration will be determined by the type of appropriations available for funding and may be issued on a 12 month basis or may include a base period of performance plus options.  The total contract maximum value will be $450 million for each contract awarded.  However, the total negotiated value of all contracts awarded may not exceed the total program ceiling of $450 million.  Questions may be addressed to the following:  S. Brian Gaines, Contracting Officer, 719-554-1969, sven.gaines@smdc-cs.army.mil; Ruth Schklar, Contract Specialist, 719-554-8488, ruth.schklar@smdc-cs.army.mil; or David McAdam, Program Manager, 719-554-1832, david.mcadam@smdc-cs.army.mil.

<DESC><p>JOINT THREAT EMITTER INCREMENT 2 (JI2)<br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>NOTE: This RFI is not a new requirement. This RFI supplements previous RFI's FA8217-08-R-JTE2, FA8217-08-R-XXX2, FA8217-08-R-TBD2, and FA8217-08-R-TBD.</p>
<p>Overview:</p>
<p><br />The purpose of this Request for Information is to assist Hill AFB Utah, Range Threat Systems Program Office (RTSPO) in Market Research of Industry to determine the extent of effort and estimated cost necessary to reach a Technical Readiness Level 6 (TRL 6) necessary for the JI2 program to proceed to the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Milestone B phase.</p>
<p>The RTSPO is proposing a phased acquisition approach for the JI2 program. Multiple contractors may be selected through source selection to participate in the Technology Development (TD) phase (1st contract award). The purpose of the TD phase is for selected contractors to verify appropriate software/hardware TRL and complete a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) that includes a formal PDR report and associated design drawings and documentation for government approval and recommendation to the Milestone Decision Authority to enter the Milestone B (EMD) phase.</p>
<p>The second phase of the program (EMD phase) will provide a 2nd contract award, which will employ full and open competition. Contractors involved during the first phase (TD) may choose to submit the designs developed when submitting their respective proposals. Other contractors not participating in the 1st contract phase will NOT be excluded from this 2nd phase and may also submit proposals for consideration. One contractor will be selected for the EMD phase to develop a complete pre-production unit, perform factory and field level testing (Site Acceptance Test) and complete Functional and Physical Configuration Audits to qualify the design. If the design meets all requirements and is accepted by the government, the 2nd contract will also contain an option to produce up to 20 production units. The government is requesting a minimum of government purpose data rights for 1st and 2nd contract. For the purpose of this RFI, no information is required or requested for this phase.</p>
<p>Request for Information:</p>
<p>This Request For Information is for the 1st contract award (TD phase) only, and requests each interested contractor provide the following information: (1) test approach to reach TRL 6 (test, verification test reports, etc); (2) schedule to reach PDR/TRL 6 and (3) estimated cost necessary to reach a PDR that includes TRL 6 documentation, design package and reports for both the software and the hardware associated with a total JI2 system (top-level system description is below).</p>
<p>Recent Change in Policy Discussion:</p>
<p>Recent changes in Government Acquisition Policy have changed emphasis on Technical Readiness Levels for both hardware and software necessary to proceed to the next Milestone acquisition phase. Recently, the Milestone Decision Authority approved program entrance post-Milestone A (TD phase) (see red program entrance diamond below for reference). The TRL 6 is a requirement necessary to enter Milestone B (EMD phase). The TRL 6 must be proven through appropriate tests or validation and included in a formal Preliminary Design Review (PDR) report for government approval scheduled prior to Milestone B. Below is the Milestone chart extracted from DODI 5000.02 (Dec 08) <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/500002p.pdf">http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/500002p.pdf</a>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;TRL Level 6 Discussion:</p>
<p>The TRL level definition is contained in the Technology Readiness Assessment Deskbook (2005) https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=154268&amp;lang=en-US and further interpreted below for hardware and software.</p>
<p>Hardware TRL 6:</p>
<p>Definition: System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment.</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>Representative model or prototype system, which is well beyond that of TRL 5, is tested in a relevant environment. This represents a major increase in a technology's demonstrated readiness. Examples include testing a prototype in a high fidelity laboratory environment or in a simulated operational environment.</p>
<p>Interpretation:</p>
<p>TRL 6 can be declared for any level of the system or a sub-system, however, the demonstration that TRL 6 has been met must be accomplished at a hardware level that matches that of a deliverable sub-system in the final system configuration. Prototype(s) tested may consist of a scaled down version (number of repeated elements) of the sub-system, as long as the characteristics of the subset used can be shown to be representative of the entire sub-system. For example, a phased array antenna sub-array consisting of approximately 10% of its total number of elements is the minimum that is determined to be acceptable. Full capability to control this sub-array and process information from the array will be required as part of the prototype.</p>
<p>Software TRL 6:</p>
<p>Definition: Module and/or subsystem validation in a relevant end-to-end environment.</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>A level at which the engineering feasibility of a software technology is demonstrated. This level extends to laboratory prototype implementations on full-scale realistic problems in which the software technology is partially integrated with existing hardware/ software systems.</p>
<p>Interpretation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Software TRL 6 must include all sub-assembly and total system interactions simulated or integrated with existing hardware sub-systems. Independent sub-systems with hardware in the loop sub-assembly simulations are preferred.</p>
<p>TRL level Related Term Definitions:</p>
<p>Model: A functional form of a system, generally reduced in scale, near or at operational specification. Models will be sufficient to allow demonstration of the technical and operational capabilities required of the final system.</p>
<p>Prototype: A physical or virtual model used to evaluate the technical or manufacturing feasibility or military utility of a particular technology or process, concept, end item, or system.</p>
<p>Relevant Environment: Testing environment that simulates the key aspects of the operational environment the system is expected to operate in.</p>
<p>Operational Environment: Environment that addresses all the operational requirements and specifications required of the final system to include platform/packaging.</p>
<p>High Fidelity: Addresses form, fit, and function. A high-fidelity laboratory environment would involve testing with equipment that can simulate and validate all system specifications within a laboratory setting.</p>
<p>Simulated Operational Environment: Either (1) a real environment that can simulate all the operational requirements and specifications required of the final system or (2) a simulated environment that allows for testing of a virtual prototype. Used in either case to determine whether a developmental system meets the operational requirements and specifications of the final system.</p>
<p>JI2 System Description:</p>
<p>The following is a top-level description of the JI2 system. This description is not intended to be all inclusive, but should be used to answer this RFI:</p>
<p>The development and delivery of a threat emitter system (as identified in the fourth paragraph of the "overview" section above) will be an unclassified, high-fidelity emitter system that shall emulate some or all of the signals of the SA-15B. The minimum signals to represent are the SA-15B target acquisition and tracking radar signals, but desire full emulation. The emitter system is expected to have a minimum of two radars, one for acquisition and the second (phased array) for target tracking and missile guidance. Both will include the capability to initiate a track using skin tracking and emulate the SA-15B system operation. The target tracking radar will be capable of tracking multiple targets simultaneously. The acquisition radar will operate while the system is on the move or at a fixed location. The target tracking radar will operate while the system is not-moving, or with a minimum delay when the system transitions from a moving to a non-moving condition.</p>
<p>The threat emitter must be designed to operate in a military ground mobile environment. The total threat emitter weight will be less than 10K pounds (5K pounds is an Objective) and transportable on a single commercially available vehicle. It is recommended the system be attached to skid pallet(s) and must not permanently attached to the vehicle for ease of removal to meet airlift transportability requirements. The system will be operable on commercial power and with a generator. The generator will be transported with the system during mobile deployment and operation of the system. Inclusion of the generator weight within the 10K pound total weight limit is desired.</p>
<p>Environmental testing for shock, vibration, thermal (Operational between-40 degrees Fahrenheit to +125 degrees Fahrenheit) will be used to verify environmental compliance. The system must be helicopter transportable without dismantling. The threat emitter shall be capable of being deployed for training use in forward operating locations and deployed at improved (e.g. graded roads and concrete pads) and unimproved (e.g. no roads, no pad - literally anywhere on a range) sites.</p>
<p>The threat emitter shall have the capability to receive, display, measure and store target track related data and provide feedback in ADDS/ICADS/TENA format for Aircrew Debriefing. The threat emitter shall support ACMI inputs from the range for initial pointing.</p>
<p>The displays for the system will be accomplished using a single computer that is operated by a single operator, and will be remotely locatable from the rest of the emitter system hardware using either GFP radio or Ethernet (specific system architecture is currently under development and more specifics will be supplied with formal System Specifiction.</p>
<p>The threat emitter shall be designed as a modular system that will require no specialized off-board calibration equipment. The modularity will also facilitate minor repairs within 20 minutes to four hours, and complex repairs within two to eight hours. The Mean Time Between Failure of the total system shall be no less than 500 hours, with the objective of 1000 hours or greater. The system shall be designed for a system Up-Time Ratio of 8 hours per day (Threshold) or 16 hours per day (Objective), 5 days per week, and 48 weeks per year for the 20 year life of the system. The threat emitter shall be designed to meet 90 to 100 percent availability of the entire threat emitter during the operational period of the system.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes.  No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.   All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside is warranted or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.
The Bureau of Reclamation is experiencing interference on an existing spread spectrum 2.4GHz (2.400 to 2.4835 GHz) 4-T-1 microwave radio system and is seeking a solution that would avoid having to change out expensive antenna and wave guide equipment and avoid having to rotate the antennas. Reclamation is interested in testing a pair of state of the art 2.4GHz 4-T1 spread spectrum radios that are designed to resolve interference problems.  The radios should provide fine-tuning capability across the entire frequency band and have many center frequencies of operation.  The radios should have an operating temperature of between -25 to +60 degrees C, or -40 to +149 degrees F at not less than 10-6 BER.  The microwave radios should also have an on board spectrum analyzer to help with resolving the interference problem.  Reclamation is seeking a 30 day product demonstration at the Drop 2 reservoir construction along Interstate Highway 8 in Imperial County, California approximately 30 miles east of El Centro, California, and 25 miles west of Yuma, Arizona. If during the 30 day test the radios do not resolve the interference problem the Bureau of Reclamation must be allowed to return the radios at no cost.  Reclamation will fund return shipping costs.               
Firms interested in participating in the above procurement are invited to submit capability statements in response to this request. The capabilities package submitted should demonstrate the firm's ability, capability, and suggested product solutions.  Packages should include the following information:  (1) Firm's name, address, telephone and fax numbers, business size and type ( 8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran, Small Business, Large Business, etc.), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number; (2) Product information; (3) a commitment to participate in a 30 day product demonstration; (4) Commercial Terms and Conditions including payment provisions and intervals.  Capability statements are due not later than March 12th, 2009 12pm PST.   All responses to this Sources Sought notice shall be provided via electronic submission.  Email or faxed responses may be submitted to Meagan Fyffe ph: (702) 293-8552, fax (702) 293-8499, or email to mfyffe@lc.usbr.gov.

<DESC><p>I. <strong>Purpose</strong>: This Sources Sought synopsis facilitates CDC's market research efforts to determine an acquisition strategy for a new requirement described below. This is not a solicitation and thus proposals are not requested and will not be accepted. Please do not request to be added to a "bidders list" because the contracting officer will not create such a list since any resulting solicitation will be posted to FEDBIZOPS for all interested and eligible offerors to respond.</p>
<p>II. <strong>Background</strong>: The National Center for Environmental Health, Division of Environmental Hazards and Health Effects (NCEH/DEHHE) requires various services broadly described in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW). A Special Notice posted on December 11, 2008 incorrectly stated: "CDC seeks to consolidate (a.k.a. "bundle") such services under a single, task order contract to streamline the acquisition process, reduce acquisition lead times, reduce the administrative burden, and increase the overall efficiency of acquiring such services." This requirement will not result in consolidation of existing contracts.</p>
<p>III. <strong>Objective of Synopsis</strong>: Offerors interested in the contemplated acquisition are invited to submit a capability statement (in accordance with Response Instructions below) to demonstrate the depth and breadth of their professional and scientific capabilities to perform the services described in the attached draft SOW. The primary purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether or not adequate competition exists among small businesses to conduct a small business set aside acquisition. Thus, small businesses, in particular, are encouraged to respond to this synopsis. Any solicitation and resulting contract awarded on the basis of a small business set aside will include Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-14 Limitation on Subcontracting. This clause requires that "At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern." The full text of the clause is provided as an attachment to this synopsis.</p>
<p>IV. <strong>Additional Information</strong>: Key features of the contemplated contract:</p>
<p>1. Contract type: Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Task Order;</p>
<p>2. Task Order Type: each task order may be either Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) , Firm Fixed Price (FFP) or a combination of CPFF and FFP depending upon the nature of the requirement;</p>
<p>3. Single Award;</p>
<p>4. Duration: Base Period: ~ 16 months; Options periods 1 thru 3: 12 Months; Option 4: ~ 8 months. Total period of contract performance not to exceed 60 months.</p>
<p>5. Total (initial) estimated ceiling price: $20M.</p>
<p>V. <strong>Response Instructions</strong>: Prepare and submit your Capability Statement as follows:</p>
<p>1. Name and address of business and point of contact information (phone # and email address);</p>
<p>2. Identify your business size status relative to NAICS code: 541990 Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services $7.0M Note: Offerors may comment on the NAICS code selected and propose an alternate NAICS code that the contracting officer may consider if the contracting officer determines that the alternate NAICS code is more representative of the services being acquired. Offerors proposing an alternate NAICS should also provide a brief explanation for proposing such NAICS code. The NAICS code manual is available at: <a href="http://www.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_sstd_tablepdf.pdf">http://www.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_sstd_tablepdf.pdf</a></p>
<p>3. Provide a one page introduction of your company.</p>
<p>4. Discuss your capabilities, resources (e.g. personnel, facilities, ability to subcontract services not otherwise available in-house), technical knowledge and experience for each of the following topics 'a' thru 'f':</p>
<p>a. Epidemiologic concepts, principles, and practices as they relate to environmental hazards and other special epidemiologic programs (e.g., natural and manmade toxins, public health disaster surveillance and response, water quality, exposure assessment);</p>
<p>b. Scientific expertise and technical assistance in planning, designing, and implementing environmental epidemiology studies of current or potential public health problems related to environmental exposures (e.g., pesticides, metals, poisons, toxins, technologic and natural disasters);</p>
<p>c. Surveillance systems and data, especially the practices and special considerations for establishing systems and analyzing and interpreting data;</p>
<p>d. Federal regulations and policies regarding human subjects, privacy, and contractual procedures;</p>
<p>e. Public relations, health education, health communication related to complex epidemiology studies and sometimes sensitive environmental exposure issues;</p>
<p>f. Identify relevant examples of past and/or current experience and include a brief explanation of the nature of the work, labor skill mix used and dollar value. Such examples should relate to the "Task Areas" listed in the attached draft SOW. For each example, identify what percentage of the work was performed by in-house employees versus subcontractor or consulting personnel.</p>
<p>5. Interested offerors may also comment on the draft SOW and may suggest changes which the Government will consider when developing the final SOW. Any suggested changes should include a brief explanation for the advantages / benefits such suggestions will contribute to the SOW. Note: SOW comments are optional.</p>
<p>6. Page limit: 15</p>
<p>7. Small Businesses: complete the Table contained in the attachment titled: "Task Area Estimated Workload Distribution"</p>
<p>8. Submit response to the contracting officer via email: FTG7@cdc.gov not later than the response due date and time stipulated in this synopsis. FAX responses are not acceptable unless otherwise authorized.</p>

Manufactured housing and recreational vehicles are in the form of park models with average dimensions of 14ft x 40ft; travel trailers averaging 8ft x 32ft; and mobile homes averaging 14ft x 65ft. FEMA has determined the manufactured housing and recreational vehicles are not suitable for residential use/habitation. FEMA is researching the logistics and cost associated with reducing the formaldehyde concentration in the manufactured housing and recreational vehicles to a level of .016ppm or below, and maintaining that level indefinitely.</p>
<p>INFORMATION REQUEST<br />Contractors with current experience and knowledge of the remediation of formaldehyde are requested to submit a two (2) page capability statement. The capability statement shall include:<br />1. Contractor company name.<br />2. Contractor's business size.<br />3. DUNS number.<br />4. Point of contact: name, title and contact information<br />5. Description of the remediation product/service, to include documentation of the science behind the process. Description should also describe proposed testing methodology and protocols for sampling and verification of indoor formaldehyde levels.<br />6. Background information on the product/service, to include how the product/service was this tested in an actual situation, for how many months and what federal health agency, if any, has approved this product/service for use.<br />7. Description of operational efforts involved in using the product/service and any/all routine maintenance requirements. <br />8. Per unit cost of remediation product/service. Also describe the level of support/infrastructure required to support the product/service, and what methodology is proposed for long-term monitoring to ensure viability of the product/service. <br />9. The formaldehyde level to which the product/service can remediate. <br />10. The time period for which the remediation product/service will remain effective, and process/procedures for monitoring long-term compliance. <br />11. The time period required for remediation of each mobile home, park model or travel trailer and the impact of a variation in the current formaldehyde level to the time period required for remediation. <br />12. The number of manufactured housing and recreational vehicles that could simultaneously be remediated.</p>
<p>Responses to this request are due by March 13, 2009, 12:00pm EST to Mary M. Petruzzo (mary.petruzzo@dhs.gov).</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER <br />This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.

The contractor will manage and support specified aspects of soliciting and receiving,processing, and evaluating responses to solicitations (e.g., proposals).  The contractormay also be required to take part in informing Offerors of the status of their proposals,and preparing documentation that must be done to permit the disbursement of funds.  Thecontractor may also be called on to organize and support meetings.  Other contractor support includes operating, maintaining and continuing to improve aGovernment-owned electronic system for submission and review of proposals, announcementsof awards, and conveying technical requirements packages and other materials toprocurement officers (e.g., the NSPIRES system, see http://nspires.nasaprs.com ). A significant component of the above function is peer review of research proposals bypanels of specialists and experts.  NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Supplement1835.016 and 1872.403 dictate that peer review be the method used to evaluate and selectresearch for funding. NASA funds intramural and extramural research primarily throughsolicited proposals that may result in grants, cooperative agreements, contracts andarrangements with other agencies, non-profit organizations, industry and academia. Solicitation mechanisms primarily used are NASA Research Announcements (NRAs),Announcements of Opportunity (AOs), and Cooperative Agreement Notices (CANs) though a fewunsolicited proposals are also received. For more information on solicitation mechanismssee Chapter 3 of Requirements for the Conduct of NASA Research and Technology(R&T) (NPR)1080.1A "3.1.2 Solicitation Mechanisms". NPR 1080.1A and other NASA procedural documentscan be accessed online at http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/main_lib.html  by searching on "NPR1080A."  Peer reviews are an important component of the proposal evaluation function.  Peerreviews evaluate relevance to NASA's objectives, intrinsic merit (which includesscientific or technical merit), the researcher's capabilities and qualifications, andcost.  Specific peer review methods differ among NASA program offices, and even amongdisciplines within a given program office, depending on, for example, cost, resourcesbrought to bear, experience, or the number and type of proposals received.  Some officesuse standing review committees, some ad hoc committees, and some a combination of thesefor individual announcements.  However, the involvement of discipline experts to evaluateand document findings of proposal reviews is universal across NASA.  Peer reviewersinclude scientists, engineers, educators and other discipline related experts, or otherappropriate personnel from public and private academic institutions, industry, Governmentlaboratories and agencies, and foreign countries.  The criteria for selecting a peer reviewer include the research they have conducted,publications, knowledge and experience, and ability to conduct an impartial review.  NASAand the contractor supporting research proposal processing maintain databases ofdiscipline experts to identify appropriate reviewers. Acknowledged experts in adiscipline and proposal authors themselves may also suggest other qualified reviewers. Use of external peers ensures fresh viewpoints, alternative perspectives, andunderstanding of the state of the art. In practice, reviews are conducted by panelmeetings (either in person or via video or telecom) and or using written evaluations(e.g., provided via the NSPIRES web interface), depending on the logistics specific tothe review. These panels consist typically of 7 to 10 members, although sometimes largerpanels of as many as 40 may be employed. It is possible that several sub-panels may beutilized. Panel members and written evaluations are solicited by phone, email etc., atthe behest of NASA.  All proceedings must be conducted in a confidential manner; theauthors of a proposal are never involved in its review or that of directly competingproposals, and all reviewers are screened to ensure that they have no conflict ofinterest with the proposals they review.  The contractor will cover all of the arrangements associated with the invitations,physical and electronic input, and panel meeting support for these reviews, includingpreparing travel reservations for panel meetings.  Reviews are conducted by mail,electronically via NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and EvaluationSystem(NSPIRES)/or by panel meetings, depending on the logistics specific to the review. Mail reviews may be conducted to allow for the use of reviewers with very specializedexpertise on technical and scientific issues. The peer review contractor must be capableof maintaining a highly dependable World Wide Web (WWW) site(NSPIRES) for electronicreceipt of Notices of Intent to propose and receipt of the actual proposals.  NSPIRESalso includes a review and selection module.  The number of such electronic submissionsranges from a few dozens to several hundred, depending on the scope of the solicitation. The contractor is expected to produce logs sorted by a wide variety of data fields basedon these electronic submissions and supply them to NASA within a few days of thesubmission deadline.  The contractor will assist NASA in screening each incoming proposalto determine compliance with eligibility criteria and consistency with general programsolicitation requirements. The contractor will be responsible for the electronic receiptand secure storage of proposals received (as many as 500 at a time in order toaccommodate the submissions of multiple solicitations) and will also be responsible foraccurately assembling packages of proposals to be sent to the designated mail reviewers,in advance of the peer review activity itself.	A majority of reviews are performed electronically via NSPIRES.  Some NASA officesrequire the contractor to determine the identity of these reviewers; in other cases, NASApersonnel will identify them.  Each panel typically consists of 7 to 10 members, and itis common to have as many as six panels meeting simultaneously to review all theproposals submitted in response to a single solicitation (as many as 150).  Panelstypically meet for three days, requiring the panel members to be resident for up to fournights.  The solicitation of panel members may be done by phone, letter, or email, whichmay be the responsibility of the support contractor.  The contractor makes transportationand lodging arrangements for the panelists and ensures that panel members areappropriately and promptly reimbursed for their travel costs to attend panel meetings,based on travel reimbursement guidelines established by NASA.  As necessary, thecontractor arranges for securing space for the panel review at commercial or NASAfacilities. The contractor will also support activities ancillary to soliciting researchproposals, such as workshops convened to formulate long-range science researchobjectives, and education/outreach initiatives that provide opportunities forparticipating in NASAs research programs to Historically Black Colleges and Universities(HBCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), and Tribal Colleges.  In order to demonstrate the capability of responding to NASAs requirement for processingresearch proposals and managing peer reviews, potential sources should provide detailedinformation to show evidence of possessing the following attributes and characteristicsnecessary for providing the required support: (1) the ability to work with a variety ofgroups, which includes the ability to manage teams of peer review personnel and multiple,simultaneous review panels; (2) availability of key personnel with project managementexperience for activities with multiple sub projects/tasks; (3) the ability to manage andcoordinate the associated proposal receipt and storage, meeting logistics support,travel, scheduling, etc. that are diverse and frequently simultaneous; (4) experience indatabase management, modification, and maintenance, in a secure network environment; (5)an acceptable or approved accounting system for Government cost-reimbursable contracts;(6) availability of financial resources to provide the required support; and (7)satisfactory work performance as evidenced by providing the names, addresses, and phonenumbers of three references for whom the potential Offeror has provided peer review orsimilar type services during the past three years.

Other Defense Agencies, Missile Defense Agency, MDIOC - Director of Contracts (MDA/DACJ), 730 Irwin Avenue Suite 362, Schriever AFB, CO 80912-7300, UNITED STATES

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONDUCTING MARKET RESEARCH. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICIATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. 

The anticipated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541513 - Computer Facilities Management Services with a size standard of $25 Million.


1. Introduction

The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is interested in receiving market information from business sources capable of providing agency-wide Service Delivery level conferencing and collaboration services based on industry best practices and practices identified by the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) framework.  

Technical work will focus on providing agency-wide Service Delivery level engineering, architecture, operation and maintenance (O&M) of existing and future video teleconference (VTC), audio conference, streaming, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), multimedia, unified collaboration systems, and related design, architecture, infrastructure, facilities and environment in support of MDAs Unified Communications strategy.  

State-of-the-art conference and collaboration rooms are used for video and audio conferencing, collaboration, training, senior level meetings, presentations and demonstration/evaluation of new emerging technologies in an effective environment. These conference and collaboration rooms enable components to effectively conduct high level meetings and presentations for its external and internal components and partners. These rooms have VTC, audio, and collaboration capability, including video network management devices, associated ancillary hardware and software components.

Places of Performance (locations) include, but are not limited to:

a.  The National Capital Region (NCR), Washington, DC metropolitan area (including offices in Arlington, Falls Church and Dahlgren, VA)

b. The Missile Defense Integration Operations Center (MDIOC), Schriever AFB, CO

c. Huntsville, AL, (multiple office locations within the Huntsville region including 
Redstone Arsenal)

d. Kirtland AFB, NM

e. Elmendorf AFB, AK

f. Fort Greely, AK

g. Los Angeles AFB, CA

h. Edwards AFB, CA

i. Vandenberg AFB, CA

j. Potential future locations: Other CONUS and OCONUS locations may be added prior to the release of the solicitation and/or after contract award via contract modification.

Subject services are currently being provided under a single MDA contract. The follow-on contract is expected to be awarded in early 2010.

2. Background

The MDA is the headquarters/acquisition agency tasked to develop and field a ballistic missile defense capability for the United States and the Department of Defense (DoD).  This includes management of critical assets and a missile force that is geographically separated not only within the NCR, but also throughout the United States and extending to locations around the world.  This geographic dispersion is one of the greatest challenges facing the agency.

The MDA was named in the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) announcement.  As such, the location specific information will change as the BRAC is implemented.  Plans now call for a much smaller contingent, estimated between two hundred and fifty (250) and three hundred (300) personnel, to remain in the NCR proper while the rest of the manpower and related resources will move to Redstone Arsenal, Huntsville, AL area in FY2010. Manning at other CONUS locations are expected to remain unchanged.

Service Delivery level conferencing and collaboration services are mission critical capabilities for the MDA that support the centralized cost-effective program executive decision analysis, performance assessment, agency collaborative management and rapid unified reporting to the President, Secretary of Defense, and Combatant Commanders.  These activities and actions relating to MDA events often require long-distance coordination and discussion in real-time.  They do not allow for periods of VTC, multimedia, information technology (IT) equipment or network downtime in excess of a few minutes without impacting cost and mission.

Potential offers should take the BRAC relocation activities into account when responding to this notice.  Service Delivery level conferencing and collaboration services at all locations are expected to remain at a high and consistent level throughout this timeframe.
3. Description
To support this mission critical capability, MDA has standardized the VTC core operations on Tandberg VTC equipment and operating systems at all core locations.  MDA has also standardized on AMX control systems for all integrated VTC systems and integrated multimedia facilities.

Furthermore, Video Services Operations Center (VSOC) at Schriever AFB, Colorado Springs, CO virtually operates and maintains multiple Tandberg Media Processing System (MPS) and 16 X 16 Multipoint Control Units (MCUs), both classified (at the Secret level) and unclassified. A MCUs/video bridge is stood up within NCR Federal Office Building 2 (FOB2) (classified Tandberg MPS) and a future bridge is to be setup in Huntsville, AL (Polycom/Accord MGC 50 and Tandberg 16x16).

Also, at FOB2 there is a Polycom/Accord MGC 100 that is set-up as an unclassified audio bridge and provides MDA VTC call augmentation (addition of audio calls into VTC, and multimedia and , unified communications calls), as well as the ability to back-up MDA VTC in the event of system or network failures.

In addition to the classified MCUs, the enterprise has KIV-7, KIV-7M, KIV-19 and KG-194 encryptors that are provided to MDA customer sites for communicating with integrated services digital network (ISDN)/switched sites.  This infrastructure where connected via Internet Protocol (IP) is managed with the Tandberg Management Suites (TMS) (both unclassified and classified) via ISDN/IP secure switching technology.

Future architectural plans include redundant VSOC facilities in the Huntsville, AL area, as well as migration of resources related to BRAC realignment.

The referenced facilities all fall under the MDA Video Alliance (MVA) (MDAs internal video network).  

Some facilities are also a part of Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) Video Services-Global (DVS-Gs) MDA VTC Community of Interest (COI).  The DVS-G MDA COI is one of many communities in the greater DISN DVS-G hierarchy.  

The MDA COI consists of a combination of .com, .mil, .gov, and .edu sites at various geographic locations throughout the United States and the Pacific (Kwajalein Atoll).

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).

The purpose of this SS is to identify qualified small business concerns [including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB] that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.

The NHLBI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the NHLBI may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP). 

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NHLBIs use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.

The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns [particularly Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)] under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541990 with a size standard of $7.0m per annum. 

Based on the responses received from this Sources Sought Notice, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Notice must have the capabilities to provide on-going, comprehensive support for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) Community Genetic Forum. Capabilities to host, plan, develop, implement and evaluate a public genomics community outreach program using a community forum as the core component of the program as outlined below in the Statement of Work.

Mission - The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) led the National Institutes of Healths (NIH) contribution to the International Human Genome Project, which had as its primary goal the sequencing of the human genome. This project was successfully completed in April 2003. Now, the NHGRIs mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease.

Background of the Project - In the spring of 2005, ECIB, in conjunction with the University of Washington, held the first annual Community Genetics Forum (http://www.genome.gov/14514654). The goals of this Forum were: to engage Northwest communities in dialogue about genetics and the ethical, legal and social implications of genetics research (ELSI); to create a forum and environment for future dialogue independent of federal sponsorship; and to create a model community engagement program and supportive materials that would be adapted by others wishing to plan, develop, implement, and evaluate a public genetics forum with community outreach in their respective communities. More than 300 members of the public participated in three days of activities.

In September of 2006, the second annual Community Genetics Forum was held in North Carolina, in collaboration with the University of North Carolina and Duke University http://genome.gov/19517845 . The goals of this Forum were to engage communities across North Carolina, including African American communities, Hispanic communities, and student and faculty audiences from North Carolina Historically Black Colleges and Universities.

The 2007 Community Genetics Forum was hosted by the University of Michigan (UM). UM engaged successfully with National Community Committee (NCC) organizations across five states in the Midwest (Michigan, Missouri, Minnesota, Iowa, and Illinois). Five forums were held on October 12, 2007 in each of the locations, and they were connected by videoconferencing. For more information see www.genocommunity.org. 

Geographic Region - In an effort to reach different geographic areas of the country, the NHGRI has selected DHHS regions VIII and IX as appropriate locations for the next Forum. This upcoming Forum should seek to engage communities from one or more locations from this region.  This region is defined to include:  Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, American Samoa, and Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, and republic of Palau.

Objectives for Project - The NHGRI is seeking an organization to host, plan, develop, implement and evaluate a public genomics community outreach program using a community forum as the core component of the program.  The materials developed and examples set by previous Forums should be used to shape this current Forum (http://www.genome.gov/19518473).

The Community Genetics Forum project is to be a collaborative effort between NHGRI and the contractor. It is expected that the NHGRIs Education and Community Involvement Branch will participate actively in the planning and development of the program and that members of the NHGRI will participate in the Forum itself, as appropriate.


The NHGRI acknowledges the challenge of conducting a one year engagement project of this caliber.  However, its success has been demonstrated by previous Forums.  It is thus vital for the offeror to show how this year-long period of performance can effectively be used.  Proposals should outline how both the Forum will build on existing programs and relationships, but also how the Forum will create new opportunities and connections. 

Scope of Project - The selected organization will host, plan, develop, implement, and evaluate a genetics public forum with community outreach. In doing such, the contractor will develop a comprehensive Community Genetics Forum report of public dissemination that outlines the overall process and results of the Forum.  This report may be reproduced and distributed to assist other individuals in the planning, development, implementation, and evaluation of other genetics public symposia with community outreach in their respective communities. The contractor will work with ECIB to develop the structure of this report. Generally, this report will add insight to previous lessons learned about how to engage communities around genetics.

Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice.  All proprietary information should be marked as such. Statements should also include an indication of current certified small business status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement (preferably placed under the eligible small business concerns name and address).  Responses will be reviewed only by NIH personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.

All capability Statements sent in response to this Sources Sought Notice must be submitted electronically to Tracy Brooks, Contract Specialist at brookstr@nhlbi.nih.gov  in either MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), by March 16, 2009, 3:30PM, EST. All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered.

<DESC>20MM M55 BP, M55 W/M12 Link, M55 W/M14A2 Link, and M56 Cartridges The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Research is to identify potential sources capable of manufacturing 20mm M55 BP, M55 with M12 Link, M55 with M14A2 Link, and M56 Cartridges. The Government Technical Data Package contains the performance specificati on and top-level drawings. The main components include Brass Cartridge Case, Propellant, Projectile, Primer, Fuze, Explosives, and various links. The performance requirements include Function and Casualty, Muzzle Velocity, Chamber Pressure, Action Time, Accuracy, Environmental Conditions, and Waterproofness. The Technical Data Package (TDP) is classified as  Distribution X ; distribution is authorized to US Government Agencies and private individuals or enterprises eligible to obtain export controlled technical data. The Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec 2751, et.seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, Title 50, U.S.C., App 2401 et.seq., restrict distribution of the TDP. Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties. Disseminate IAW provisions of DOD Directive 5230.25. Offerors must be registered with the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office to obtain a copy of the top  drawings (See www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for instructions and information).   A respondent to this market survey must have available the facilities and skills required to design and prove-out 20mm M55 BP, M55 W/M12 Link, M55 W/M14A2 Link, and M56 Cartridges. Specific capabilities and skills required to manufacture the 20mm M55 BP, M55 W/M12 Link, M55 W/M14A2 Link, and M56 Cartridges are as follows: Specific production capabilities required include: case prime machine to insert the electric primer into cartridge case; projectile explosive loading, with fuze in sertion; projectile assembly equipment; cartridge Load, Assemble, and Pack (LAP) equipment to weigh and load propellant and insert the projectile body/assembly into the cartridge case, crimp and gage cartridge chamber height, and link and pack-out; and ballistic test facilities and equipment for measuring velocity, pressure, action time, time of flight, etc. Production support equipment includes material handling systems, tool room equipment, ultrasonic test equipment, automatic inspection equipment, and metrology and metallurgy laboratories.

<DESC>Justification and Approval - FAR 6203-1Notice of Intent to award a sole source contract to Accuity, Inc. Accuity is required to conduct a Data Pilot Proof of Concept (POC) study to assess the potential value of implementing Accuity's Asset Verification Program for verifying bank account balances of applicants and receipts of VA's needs based programs (i.e. Improved Pension).  The Data Pilot POC will be conducted using proprietary processing data collected during normal operations of a similar AVS program conducted exclusively by Accuity.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), anticipates approximately 280,000 needs based claims requiring verification of bank balances per year.	In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Accuity, Incorporated (a division of SourceMedia, Incorporated, Skokie, Illinois), is the only known source capable of providing the asset verification processing data necessary to conduct the proposed Data Pilot POC to assess and report on the potential value of implementing an AVS to assist in determining the eligibility of applicants/recipients requesting financial assistance through one of VA's needs based programs. Since the data is collected from the actual operation of Accuity's AVS, Accuity is the sole source and proprietary owner of the information required to conduct the Data Pilot as it has been proposed.   Accuity is a data and software company which has the proven capability to combine superior financial institution data intelligence, advanced technologies and comprehensive community development programs to create AVS which will greatly enhance the agency's ability to accurately and efficiently determine the eligibility status of individuals applying for financial assistance. Accuity currently operates an AVS program for the Social Security Administration's Supplemental Security Income program. The AVS has utilized Accuity's unique expertise.  Since 1911, Accuity has been the official registrar of American Bankers Association (ABA) Routing and Transit numbers for all U.S. financial institutions.  In this role, Accuity maintains the most comprehensive database of financial institutions for asset verification routing. Accuity's AVS is used in developing cooperative relationships between the U.S. financial institutions community and various process endpoint to ensure that the information being provided not only expedites the eligibility determination process, but also enhances the agency's ability to prevent payments to ineligible recipients and detect potential cases of fraud and abuse.  Accuity is the only source with existing AVS data that can be utilized to perform the Proof of Concept Data Pilot for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Since 2003, Accuity has operated a highly successful version of the Asset Verification Program for the Social Security Administration. During the five plus years of performing this service this requirement has been solicited on the open market on numerous occasions and no other company has ever submitted a bid nor has ever claimed to have any capabilities remotely close to Accuity.  This service will be procured under Firm Fixed Price in accordance with FAR 12 and 13 procedures and Other than Full and Open Competition as authorized under FAR 6.302-1. The anticipated award date is March 27, 2009.  Point of Contact for this acquisition is Cassandra Hickman at (202) 461-6848 or email:  Cassandra.Hickman@va.gov

<SUBJECT>Use of Back-Scattering Inferometry Technology for the Development of Sexually Transmitted Infections Diagnostic Test
<SOLNBR>200-2009-Q-11173
<CONTACT>Deborah T Workman, Contract Specialist, Phone 404-639-8893, Fax 404-639-8095/8155, Email atl7@cdc.gov
<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces its intention to negotiate a sole source award with the Vanderbilt University Department of Chemistry, Nashville, TN to utilize Back-Scattering Interferometry (BSI) in developing new assays that will focus on detecting the presence of sexually transmitted disease (STD) antigens, including point-of-care test that potentially offer an alternative to traditional non-treponemal test (VDRL,RPR) and treponemal test (TP-PA, EIAs, FTA-Abs) and detect specific IgM antibody for the diagnosis of congenital syphilis.</p>
<p>Currently, syphilis diagnosis is most commonly performed by serological tests, which are categorized into two groups: treponemal and non-treponemal tests. These tests have a variety of limitations, including that some of them can only be performed on serum and require quantities greater than 10 microliters.</p>
<p>New technologies are being developed that can be adapted to sexually transmitted disease diagnosis, utilizing a reduced sample quantity as well as expanding the tests to whole blood, thereby mainstreaming the laboratory procedure by eliminating the requirement of venous blood collection. These technologies can be adapted to detect specific antigens and also organism-specific nucleic acid sequences by use of specific non-labeled probes.</p>
<p>(BSI) is an advanced optical technique which allows for highly sensitive qualitative and quantitative, label-free detection of molecular interactions in free-solution or on-surface supports. BSI is a new technology which significantly accelerates assay development because it demonstrates zeptomole sensitivity, uses very small sample volumes (&lt; 2 microliters), and requires little apriori knowledge of the molecular interactors.</p>
<p>Specifically, the contractor shall perform the following tasks on this project:</p>
<p>1. Develop an assay to detect unlabeled human antibodies against treponemal protein antigens (example: 15-, 17-, 44, and or 47 kDa lipoproteins). All assays should involve label-free antigens and antibodies and require less than 10 ul of sample. The assay should be quick, less than 1 minute, and have sensitivity on the picomole level or better.<br />2. Develop an assay to detect unlabeled human antibodies against non-protein treponemal antigens, i.e. cardiolipin. <br />3. Analyze 100 characterized patient sera and distinguish reactive or positive human serum from normal human serum in order to distinguish active cases of syphilis.<br />4. Analyze the above patient sera for reactive IgM antibodies and reactive IgG antibodies.<br />5. In consultation with CDC, write a manuscript and submit for scientific publication.</p>
<p>Vendor must have the capacity, resources, infrastructure and hands-on experience to develop and perform research experiments specifically using back-scattering interferometry technology. This technology is not commercially available and therefore the vendor is required to have full-developmental access (instrumentation and equipment necessary for the development of these new tests in-house or easily accessible with experienced staff available) to this technology in order to fulfill the requirements of this procurement.</p>
<p>Vendor must have at least two years of expertise in back-scattering interferometry technology development.</p>
<p>CDC intends to negotiate this requirement with Vanderbilt University under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). <br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties who believe they possess the capabilities to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their abilities to meet this requirement. All responses should be received by the March 25, 2009, at 4 PM, Eastern Standard Time (EST). All responses must be in writing and can be sent via email to atl7@cdc.gov or fax to 770-488-8350. No phone calls will be accepted.</p>

Sampling will consist of the collection of samples to evaluate for both viable and non-viable airborne fungi in an effort to screen for airborne microbiological constituents.  Spore trap samples shall be collected on Air-O-Cell cassettes at a calibrated flow rate of 15 liters per minute and analyzed by light microscopy.  Culturable airborne fungi samples shall be collected using a single stage viable microbial particle sampler at a calibrated flow rate of 28.3 liters per minute on malt extract agar plates and analyzed to identify fungi present to species level.  Analysis of all air samples shall be completed by a laboratory that: (1) is completely independent of the entity collecting the samples; (2) is accredited by the American Industrial Hygiene Associations EMLAP program for environmental microbiology: and (3) is pre-approved by the RMRS for this project.

All sample and evaluation results shall be submitted in a timely manner in the form of a summary letter report that shall briefly describe procedures used, field observations, and sample results.  Interpretations, conclusions and recommendations based on observations and/or results will not be included in the submitted report.  Please see the attached solicitation for a full statement of work.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-30.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334310 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  However, this is a full and open competition, and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Photron Ultima APX-RS M2 GB  High Speed Video System.
 
Brand Name Only Justification:   The Surface and Microanalysis Science Division of NISTs Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory has a requirement for a Photron Ultima APX-RS high speed digital camera.  This camera is to be used in conjunction with NISTs existing Ultima APX-RS high speed digital camera to produce stereo high speed videography.

The required high speed camera must be capable of 250,000 frames per second, with 1024 x 1024 pixel resolution at up to 3,000 frames per second and 512 x 512 pixel resolution at 10,000 frames per second.  The required camera must communicate with the existing camera and existing software to maintain essential research capabilities.  Photron USA has confirmed that the required camera software and communications applications are proprietary and thus cannot be provided by any other manufacturer.

Purchasing a new high speed digital camera from another manufacturer would necessitate replacing the existing high speed digital camera, an unnecessary duplication of costs.

NIST cites authority of FAR subpart 13.106 b (1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as primary rationale for Brand Name Only Determination.
 
***Line item 0001 is a BRAND NAME ONLY requirement.***

***All interested Contractors shall provide a quote for the following:

 Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Photron Ultima APX-RS M2 GB High Speed Video System.

The Photron Ultima APX-RS M2 GB High Speed Video System shall consist of the following components:

1.	Ultima APX-RS FM (Monochrome)  Photron part 1417-0001
2.	Memory (8 BGyte optional module)  Photron part 1410-8000
3.	Gigabit Ethernet  Photron part 1410-1000

Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640. 

Award shall be made to the firm that provides the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote.  Technical acceptability means that the quote meets all of the stated minimum specifications. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement," 2) Past Performance and 3) Price.    

Technical Capability:

Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. Quoters shall include the manufacturer or brand name, make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which addresses all salient characteristics, and clearly documents that the offered product meets salient characteristics stated above and meets the needs of the Government in essentially the same manner as the brand name.

Past Performance:

Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product & service provided and the Contractors history of meeting delivery schedules for prior deliverables. Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided and/or the quoters recent and relevant procurement history with NIST or its affiliates.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division is looking to procure 8 each of an ILARTS Camera Assembly in accordance with Drawing #627740-1.  Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This requirement is 100% Set Aside for Small Business. Delivery is required ninety(90) days or less after Receipt of Award. The Government is requesting Destination pricing for this requirement.
Television cameras utilized by aircraft carrier Landing Signal Officers (LSO) need to provide good imagery, day and night, under conditions where the aircraft is illuminated by ambient light but the aircraft's bright landing lights are on, resulting in intra-scene dynamic range of -10E6. These TV cameras provide the LSO with glide-slope and lineup information, and also view deck operations, approaches, and launches. This application, vital to aircraft carrier operations, needs a television image sensor and camera system to replace the Image Isocon based cameras which are no longer manufactured. The television image sensor affording the necessary dynamic range is the Charge Coupled Device (CCD). Their high quantum efficiency and low readout noise make CCDs competitive at low illumination levels with intensified image sensors and provide superior performance at moderate and high light levels. The conclusion of this Phase I study is that a camera based on back illuminated CCD technology can match and in some cases exceed the benchmark Image Isocon camera performance in the demanding ILARTS application. Specifications are on Drawing 627740-1.
The drawings involved are Export Controlled.  All requests for copies of these drawings must contain a certified copy of DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement.  To obtain certification, contact Defense Logistics Information Service at (800)352-3572 or www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/documents.him.  The certified DD2345 shall be sent to Debbie Dewyea at fax 732-323-7192 or email to deborah.dewyea@navy.mil to obtain all the applicable specifications.  Also, all vendors must be registered in the Central Contract Registration (CCR) Database.  The internet website is http://www.ccr.dlsc.dla.mil/ccringq or www.ccr.gov.  It is mandatory to register with the CCR as your Duns Number(Data Universal Numbering System) and your CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code will be required to conduct business with the Department of Defense. In addition, all invoices will be electronically submitted in the Wide Area Work Flow(WAWF); information available in FAR Clause 5252.232-9513.  All requests will be made to Debbie Dewyea at fax 732-323-7192 or email: deborah.dewyea@navy.mil.  All responsible sources may submit  a quotation which, if received in a timely manner, shall be considered by the agency.  Closing date is 18 March 2009.

Submit quotations to the office specified in this solicitation on or before the date specified in this solicitation. Quotations may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation.

Vendors that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.<br />(c) Period for validity of quotations. The vendor agrees to establish a firm timeframe in which the proposed price is good for.<br />(d) Reserved<br />(e) Multiple quotations. Vendors are encouraged to submit multiple quotations presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each quotation submitted will be evaluated separately.<br />(f) Reserved<br />(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate quotations as described in FAR 13.106-2. Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government may accept other than the lowest quote; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotes received. <br />(h) Reserved<br />(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all quotations exceeding $3,000, and quotations of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The vendor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its quotation, the annotation ``DUNS'' or ``DUNS +4'' followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the vendor's name and address. The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the vendor to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. A vendor within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. A vendor located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The vendor should indicate that it is a vendor for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.<br />(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of a quotation, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the vendor does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered vendor. Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.<br />(l) Reserved<br />(End of Provision)<br />In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security

<p>Section C Description</p>
<p>CLIN's 0001 through 0006 and 1001 through 1006<br />The contractor shall provide rectangular metal frames to fit openings in existing structures. Each frame will be made from a &lsquo;C' formed channel of 3/8" thick hot rolled mild steel (ASTM A-36) in the following dimensions: 3" side by 8.25" base by 3" opposite side. Each corner will be welded on both the inside and out for the entire length of seam. Each corner will incorporate a 1" pipe (schedule 40) welded in such a way that each of the two end openings is exposed and centered on the 3" side walls; the pipe acts as a thru and thru tube passage for the mounting bolts (drawings will be provided before the site visit). All pipes must be uniformly placed to facilitate a variety of openings. The pipe will be designated as the &lsquo;mounting hole. Each frame must be capable of being filled and transported with CMU concrete blocks or other masonry materials while safely stored in the racks. On the top, inside of each frame will be two forklift points made of &lsquo;C' channel steel welded approximately 4' apart to accommodate movement by large forklifts (Zoom Boom model ZB20044 or equivalent). All frames and hardware will be treated with a rust preventive black or gray paint. Sizes are approximate, the offeror will be required to make a site visit to re-take and confirm all measurements. Government furnished drawings will be provided to the parties requesting attendance to the site visit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />CLIN 0007 and 1007<br />The contractor shall provide and install &frac12;" thick mount plates with a 5/8" threaded hole, the holes are required to be centered on the mounting hole when the frame is installed. The plates shall include all hardware required to mount the frames into the walls IAW NSWDG provided drawing. The contractor shall be required to provide washers and bolts (approximately 5/8" x 10"). All hardware will be treated with a rust preventive black or gray paint. Sizes are approximate; the vendor will be required to make a site visit to re-take and confirm all measurements and to ensure the proper fit of the frames and mounting plates to the wall. At the time of the site visit the contractor will be furnished drawings by the government.</p>
<p>CLIN 0008 and 1008<br />The contractor shall provide frame storage. The purpose of each rack is to safely store and transport the frames described within this solicitation. The rack shall consist of two parts: a seven storage carriage that holds the frames in an up-right position and the base frame which hold the carriages. Each storage carriage shall be made of &frac14;' framed channel and the base frame will be made of W6 x 25# I-beam. Each carriage shall be capable of holding the frame on two sides and is separated from other carriage (on the base frame) by approximately 10". Each base frame will have forklift points at each end. The approximate rack dimensions required are 3'x 8'x 8'. While the frames are on rack, the mounting hole shall be used to secure the frames to rack via an 8.5' keeper rod. The rod is required to have a locking system and storage area. The constructed racks will be routinely used to transport frames on a flatbed truck. All racks and hardware are required to be treated with a rust preventive black or gray paint.

<DESC><p>a) The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Strategic Planning Directorate (XR) plans to award a sole source contract to the Utah State University Research Foundation Space Dynamics Laboratory (USURF/SDL), a non-profit University Affiliated Research Center (UARC), for the research and development of Infrared (IR) payloads, test and evaluation, software development, and data processing, from 10 April 2009 to 10 April 2014 (five years). The estimated approximate value is $48 million.</p>
<p>b) The intent is to award a contract to maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational institution, USURF/SDL. USURF/SDL's core competencies include (but are not limited to) sensor systems research and development (including calibration and testing), data exploitation (including algorithm development), sensor modeling and simulation and prototyping of space systems (including microsat sensor systems and components).</p>
<p>c) As a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC), USURF/SDL shall initially assist SMC/XR (and STRATCOM, AFSPC, and similar agencies) by testing and calibrating the Commercially Hosted Infra-Red Payload (CHIRP) sensor and continuing its support of the Algorithm Development Laboratory at SMC which supports the 3GIRS program. It is also contemplated that USURF/SDL could support the cubesat program, either by testing or developing prototypes, and also other programs in SMC and XR due to the omnibus nature of the contract.</p>
<p>d) This contract is necessary to meet the following requirements: <br />&bull; Continue developing and advancing the Technology Readiness Level of full-earth Wide Field-of-View (WFOV) IR systems, related components, and supporting architecture through test and evaluation, software development, and data processing;<br />&bull; Allow us to have this expertise under one SMC contract vehicle.</p>
<p>e) Functions to be performed by USU/SDL include: <br />&bull; Designing and developing; fabricating, assembling, handling, and integrating; and analyzing, testing, and evaluating sensor systems and components (including cubesats), as well as, designing, manufacturing, testing, and modeling cryogenic systems and thermal design;<br />&bull; Electronics assembly, including: cable and harness assembly, box and electronics assembly, integration, and inspection;<br />&bull; Investigating vibration isolation and jitter control methods;<br />&bull; Calibrating, characterizing, testing, and evaluating sensors, including environmental testing (a facility using thermal-vac, vibration, and EMI/EMC tests) and sensor calibration (specifically the ability to perform relative spectral responsivitiy using Fourier transform spectrometry and cryogenic IR sensor calibration equipment);<br />&bull; Data compression/decompression, data visualization, data exploitation, data fusion, data processing, handling, and analysis; and<br />&bull; Modeling and simulation of optics, structures, thermal characteristics, controls systems, pointing, contamination, orbit propagation, image processing and scene generation.</p>
<p>f) Potential Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) are mitigated in the following manner: <br />(1) Preventing unfair competitive advantage - To prevent SDL from gaining an unfair competitive advantage, XR will include in the OCI clause a provision that SDL may not compete at either the prime or the subcontractor level against industry in response to competitive RFPs for development and production involving engineering expertise specifically developed or maintained through this sole source UARC contract (issued under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3)(B)). This makes USU/SDL a neutral member of the government team and thereby eliminates this OCI issue. <br />(2) Preventing the existence of conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment - Because the knowledge SDL will gain from testing and evaluating sensors from various contractors will not be used by SDL to develop and build competitive options for an objective system, any bias or perception of bias in SDL's test and evaluation of the various sensors will be minimal to nonexistent.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>Synopsis for New Orleans East Back Levee, Reach LPV 111<BR>(Preconstruction Services and Construction Options)<BR><BR>The NAICS code for this requirement is 237990.  This is an UNRESTRICTED procurement. The estimated magnitude of construction cost is between $250,000,000 and $500,000,000.  <BR><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Hurricane Protection Office intends to issue a solicitation for preconstruction services and construction option(s) for Levee Improvements to the New Orleans East Back Levee, Reach LPV 111 in Orleans Parish, LA.   The solicitation will be a Request for Proposal for a Firm Fixed-Price Base  with a Fixed Price Incentive Option requirement in accordance with FAR SubPart 16.403 utilizing Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) also known as Construction Manager at Risk.  The project is critical to the Hurricane Storm Damage Risk Reduction System and must be completed by June 1, 2011.  <BR><BR>This requirement is an essential component of the New Orleans Hurricane Protection System in Orleans Parish.  Reach LPV 111 is an earthen levee which is adjacent to the north side of the GIWW starting at the eastern terminus of the concrete I-Wall just east of Michoud Canal at approximate Sta. 1342+74 running east to Sta. 1105+50. From there, the levee section turns north and terminates at Sta. 1061+13 at the south wall of the CSX Railroad Gate, a total length of approximately 28,161 feet or 5.3 miles. Included therein is a T-Wall from approximate Sta. 1242+04 to Sta. 1235+51 with three 72 inch discharge pipes from Pump Station No. 15 that pass through the stem of this structure. New T-Walls were recently constructed at each end of the pump station.   Also included  is the construction of a new concrete T-wall near the west end of LPV 111.01, as well as the construction of the tie in structure that will provide permanent protection at the tie-in point of the IHNC surge wall.  This option includes approximately 1000 of new T-wall bringing the new protection elevation to EL 32.0.  The approximate stations of the new T-wall are from Sta. 1342+74 to sta. 1352+74, with the tie-in structure extending approximately 100 feet past to sta. 1353+74.<BR><BR>The existing earthen levee sections are at El. 19.5 and were restored to this elevation following extensive degradation from Hurricane Katrina. This project involves raising the existing earthen levee to elevation varying from El. 28.0 to El. 31.5, as well as constructing new T-wall to a new protection elevation of EL 32.0.  In order to accomplish the embankment construction while keeping the footprint of the levee within the existing right of way, the foundation will have to be strengthened by a Deep Soil Mixing (DSM) method. The Contractor will need to closely coordinate with the AE designer of both the levee section and the T-Wall section. The Contractor will also need to coordinate with the design and construction of improvements to the CSX Railroad gate on the Northeast end of the project and to any improvements that may be in progress at the west end of the project. LPV 111.02, and the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal floodwall.<BR><BR>Evaluation will be based on the Tradeoff Process (Best Value Continuum) in accordance with FAR SubPart 15.101-1 and Source Selection SubPart 15.3.  The evaluation criteria consists of four (4) Technical (non-cost) factors, each of which has additional sub-factors for evaluation and Price.  The Technical (non-cost) factors, listed in descending order of importance, are:  (1) Technical Experience; (2) Past Performance; (3) Preconstruction Services Plan; and (4) Construction Approach.  Technical (non-cost) factors when combined are significantly more important than Price.  The basis of award will be made to the Offeror who provides the best value to the Government. The resulting award will be a Firm Fixed Price base portion for the preconstruction services and Fixed Price Incentive Option the construction phase.<BR><BR>Extent of participation of small businesses (SB), small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), women-owned small businesses (WOSB), veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and minority institutions on the proposed contract are measured as a percentage of the total planned subcontracting dollars. The selected firm, if a large business firm, must comply with FAR Subpart 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for submitting and negotiating a subcontracting plan. The  District Small Business participation goals are: (1) at least 70.00% of the subcontract amount be placed with SBs, which include SDBs and WOSBs; (2) at least 6.2% of the subcontract amount be placed with SDBs; (3) at least 7.0% of the subcontract amount be placed with WOSBs; (4) at least 9.8% for HUBzone SB; (5) 3.0% for VOSB; and (6) at least 0.9% for SDVO SB. <BR><BR>Solicitation is anticipated to be issued on or about March 06, 2009.<BR><BR>Point of contact for this notice is Ms. Missee Koehn at (504) 862-2134 or e-mail: melissa.k.koehn@usace.army.mil.

<DESC><p>Design and install a Klaxon type alerting system in various facilities throughout Shaw AFB. This system will be an audible/visual system designed to alert National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) aircrew members to respond to their aircraft (E4B) for immediate launch. Operational control of this aircraft falls under the Joint Chiefs of Staff and is in direct support of the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense.
<p>The Klaxon system must be wireless to include receivers, transmitters, antennas, horns and lights and all necessary installation hardware. Horns must be loud enough to wake an average person from deep sleep and lights must be amber rotating beacons or strobes. Primary system activation will come from the E4B aircraft with backup activation capability from both primary and alternate 20 FW Command Posts. When the system is activated, the horns and lights located in all 15 designate locations must operate. The system must be &lsquo;stand-alone' and totally independent from any other alert notification system on the base. Due to frequency management time constraints however, the system must utilize the same radio frequencies as the current base Giant Voice (GV) system. This installation contractor must also use equipment compatible with the current GV equipment.</p>

Effective competition for the first time since 1997 resulted from an UNRESTRICTED pre-solicitation synopsis advertising this annual requirement of the centralized agency Radiation Safety Officer of the Air Force (RSO) on FBO.&nbsp; Effective competition resulted in four technically capable companies&nbsp;providing responsive offers&nbsp;to the Contracting Officer.&nbsp; The Contracting Officer received responsive offers from two large&nbsp;sized companies and responsive offers from&nbsp;two&nbsp;small 8(a) companies. Budgetary estimated unit prices from both technically capable large companies exceeded the lowest unit price offer.</p>
<p>3. The Contracting Officer received to acceptable offers from two different small disadvantaged 8(a) businesses and&nbsp;had a reasonable expectation of effective price competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sole source 100% 8 (a) set aside negotiations were restricted to the incumbent contractor that submitted the&nbsp;lowest price technically acceptable offer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. This acquisition like prior annual awards for these same services since 1997 remains a sole source 8(a) award because total&nbsp;award value (price)&nbsp;remains far less than the&nbsp;SBA minium dollar threshold&nbsp;of $3.5 Million typicially required for&nbsp;competitive 8(a) awards.</p>

<DESC><p>The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) proposes to award to The University of Rhode Island (URI) on a sole source basis to assist in the evaluation, review, updating, revision and promotion of the Food Safe Schools Action Guide Kit (Action Guide). As a part of the developmental process, the state of Rhode Island was funded to implement the draft Action Guide in order to test it out and provide feedback for the final version. The final version of the Action Guide was released in 2004 and due to funding issues the Action Guide had a limited distribution. Staff from URI, who were funded under the original grant and were involved in the development and implementation of the original Action Guide; are uniquely qualified to conduct a comprehensive evaluation, review, revision and implementation of the resource. URI was part of the development of the Action Guide so they know the content well. The resource is multi-component; it would take a new vendor a considerable amount of time to become familiar with the document and the interaction of the components. URI was funded to implement the Action Guide in schools, so they are practiced in using the components of the Action Guide, especially the needs assessment document. Given these first hand experiences they are uniquely qualified to assess the content and design for revisions. This procurement will be awarded using other than full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302. This is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to meet these requirements. Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement and will be at the sole discretion of the Contracting officer. If no written responses are received at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this synopsis, the contract will be awarded without further notice.</p>
