<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a contract extension to Imperial College London for wrap-up activities under CDC contract 200-2005-13328.

Reports of potentially raised rates of disease around environmental sources or in specific areas can cause great public anxiety and need to be handled efficiently and effectively by the authorities concerned. A common part of the response to such reports is to use routinely collected statistics to establish whether rates of the disease are higher than would be expected based on the population at risk and on a reference set of rates. The UK Rapid Inquiry Facility (RIF) was developed by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) of Imperial College London in order to speed up this resource intensive part of the investigation process.  The RIF is able to rapidly generate rates and relative risks for any given health outcome, for specified age and year ranges, for any given geographical area.  During the first two years of work under contract 200-2005-13328, the RIF was successfully transformed to US conditions, and several enhancements were been made according to the agreed Project objectives and Scope of work. Thus, in order to increase the functionality and versatility of the RIF, it has been redesigned and reprogrammed to be more flexible. The RIF is now database independent and allows input of exposure modeling data. The RIF also exports output data for further analysis in other (statistical) software packages (e.g. WinBUGS, SATScan) and is now fully integrated with SaTScan. A RIF manual including training material has been prepared and has been successfully used at training courses in Atlanta (2006) and Seattle (2007). 

The primary objective of this contract extension is to obtain the Contractor?s assistance in completing additional enhancements and trainings necessary to successfully implement and disseminate the work conducted during the first two years of this contract.  Overall project objectives as stipulated in original contract remain the same. Specifically for the performance period August 1, 2007 until July 31, 2008, we propose that Imperial College will further: 
	1. Implement the RIF in additional CDC-EPHTN states/organizations. 
	2. Further enhance the RIF. 
	3. Conduct additional training activities to meet demand from funded states. 

It is imperative to use Imperial London College for this contract extension.  The RIF system, created by the Imperial College of London, offers unique features that other contractors cannot provide and make it uses a novel approach to generating expanded credible scientific data linking environmental and health effects using limited or sparse data.  While others are also exploring ways of linking this type of data, the results provided by this proprietary system are unique to the Imperial College of London?s RIF.  Access is restricted to the Imperial College.  

The North American Industry Classification Code is 611310.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but all replies received within 15 days of publication will be considered.  A determination not to compete based on responses received and to proceed with a noncompetitive award is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a contract to Fundaci?n Dominicana de Infectolog?a.

This contract will fund recruitment, vaccination, data and specimen collection, and associated administrative and regulatory activities for 402 remaining participants in an ongoing clinical trial of influenza vaccination, formally entitled ?Clinical Trial of Safety (Reactogenicity) and Immunogenicity of Needle free Jet Injection of Reduced-dose, Intradermal Influenza Vaccine (INF) administered to ?d6 -to- <24 Month-old Infants and Toddlers in the Dominican Republic?.  Scientific details are online at: http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00386542.  

The subjects to be studied under this contract are designated numbers 049 through 450.  Subjects 001 through 048 have already been fully studied under previous contract 200-2002-00617 with the Fundaci?n Dominicana de Infectolog?a (FDI), on behalf of its affiliated Department of Infectious Diseases of the Hospital Infantil Dr. Robert Reid Cabral (HIRRC).  This institution is the national children?s hospital of the Dominican Republic Secretar?a de Estado de Salud P?blica y Asistencia Social (SESPAS, ministry of health).  

It is imperative to utilize Fundaci?n Dominicana de Infectolog?a for this contract.  FDI?s performance of the preceding phase of this trial was justified under FAR part 6.302.1 on the grounds that it was the only known source with the knowledge, capability, authority, and documented, published experience to conduct clinical vaccine trials among children in the Dominican Republic, according to international standards and within the proposed time frame.  This was verified by a Sources Sought notice (solicitation number 2002-N-00357) which was posted online by the U.S. Government on February 01, 2002.

There remains no other potential contractor who could perform phase II, given the unique skills required in performing this work, and given the constraints to complete the trial in a timely fashion.  Preparation for this trial required several years of preparation, training of staff, and time-consuming permissions solicited from the national regulatory authority for medicines and drugs and hospital and Dominican national and hospital ethical review committees.  

Trial preparation by another vendor, of which there are none known to be qualified, would be cost prohibitive and would likely require two years of delay in changing approved protocols, obtaining permissions from four ethical review committees (CDC, WHO, and two in the Dominican Republic), and training new physicians, nurses, and laboratory staff.  In addition, switching vendors at this time may jeopardize the validity and continuity of this study.

The North American Industry Classification Code is 541710.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but all replies received within 15 days of publication will be considered.  A determination not to compete based on responses received and to proceed with a noncompetitive award is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This procurement action covers a requirement by the CDC/Division Molecular Virology and Vaccines Branch for a DECYDER version 6.5 software package with two licenses from GE Healthcare in order to properly analyze protein expression data generated from fluorescent scanning of 2-D DIGE (Difference Gel Electrophoresis) gels. The currently used software is outdated and unable to analyze statistically relevant differences in protein expression profiles. This software will greatly enhance our proteomic laboratory's ability to use 2-D gel electrophoresis to measure the protein expression profiles of a variety of biologically significant systems including the in vitro and in vivo consequences of influenza virus infection. Thus, award of a Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13 is contemplated.  CDC will consider all responsible sources responding to the RFQ. All questions/concerns about the RFQ shall be submitted via e-mail to Bbiltz@cdc.gov. The RFQ document will be available and posted at this site for downloading. No telephone requests of the solicitation will be accepted. No hard copy of the RFQ will be mailed. It is your responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding the RFP on the Fedbizopps website.

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) intends to negotiate a sole-source contract with the Shannon & Wilson, Inc.  The purpose of this effort is for controlling erosion on steep slopes using a design produced by Shannon & Wilson. While the project was monitored for two years after construction was completed, that period was unusually dry, and thus did not serve well to test the technique's erosion control capability.  Since that time, periods of unusually heavy rains have occurred, providing an opportunity to test this design's performance.  An evaluation of the demonstration can now be made that should be more revealing than what could be observed during the original project monitoring period, and a final report on the project can now be produced.  A seven-month period of performance is contemplated for the contractual effort.  This is not a competitive requirement and no competitive solicitation is available.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Blue Horizon Development Software, 1247 North Church Street, Moorestown NJ 08057-1153 for the purchase of the following item: 

Gedae Target Development Software License with 1 year of Software Maintenance. This software will be used with the Cell Broadband Engine. It provides the capability to map and optimize flow graphs for the multi-core hardware.

Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, information received by the response date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS code is 511210.

Sole Source Justification:
 
The Gedae Target Development Software provides users the ability to export an application to be run on a target system. The application can then be run either attached to the development environment or in a stand-alone mode. The Gedae software license enables embedded software development for the CELL processor and includes all required libraries and software. The Gedae software and runtime licenses are required for the AFRL/IFEC developed systems which are used by customers for research and development under the Network-Centric Exploitation and Tracking and Speech Processing for Audio Exploitation programs. Blue Horizon Development Software is the only known source that distributes Gedae software, which is the only software that can meet the government's requirements for these research applications.

Contracting Office Address:

Department of the Air Force, Air Force Space Command, Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), ISSW/PKS, 483 N. Aviation Boulevard, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659

The Space Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS) Program Office intends to issue a contract for the production of one (1) additional SBIRS Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite (GEO 3) and two (2) additional Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) payloads (HEO 3&4).  An option will be included for an additional Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite (GEO 4). GEO 3 (and GEO 4 if exercised) and HEO 3&4 are anticipated to be derivatives of the existing designs developed under the SBIRS Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract with minimal modifications.  GEO 3 (and GEO 4 if exercised) is intended to continue deployment of the full SBIRS High constellation.  HEO 3&4 are planned as replenishments for the first two HEO payloads. The new GEO satellite and HEO payloads must integrate with the existing ground operations and maintenance support infrastructure with minimal changes. 

The SBIRS program office anticipates releasing the sole source RFP in July 2007 with a contract award in January 2008 (See numbered note 22).  It has been determined that Lockheed Martin is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy our requirements.  The contract type will be cost-plus award fee and cost plus incentive fee.  The intended contractor is Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC), 1111 Lockheed Martin Way, Sunnyvale, CA 94089-1212. 

The SBIRS Program Office has contracted with LMSSC over the last 11 years and they possess the required data and prototypes necessary to produce the items described above. LMSSC has the capability to fulfill this contract without the SBIRS Program Office having to expend significant funds on another contractor to reach the equivalent capability. Contractors interested in subcontracting opportunities should contract LMSSC directly.  The NAICS code is 336414 (size standard: 1,000 employees).

Each Prime contractor will be authorized 6-8 personnel at the forth coming Industry Day.  One of the attendees must be a security person. One-on-one sessions will take place on the 24th immediately after the Industry Day presentation and if needed the 25th & 26th.   Each one-on-one session will be 45 minutes unless there is a need to shorten the sessions to 30 min due to the number of interested contractors.

On 26 January, 2007, the initial Industry Day for SYSW Sustainment Support was conducted.  Since then the government has revised its strategy and acquisition approach. The original approach was to award multiple contracts through an IDIQ contract and is now revised to award a single contract. This industry day, the Government team will brief attending contractors on the updated goals, requirements and strategy for acquiring sustainment support services for the various SMC/SYSW ground-based deployable systems.  The programs supported by this contract include: the Counter Communication System (CCS) Family of Systems, the Space Test and Training Range (STTR) Family of Systems, the Rapid Attack Identification Detection and Reporting System (RAIDRS) Family of Systems and Rapid Reaction Capabilities (RRCs), along with any future deployable SYSW system whose sustainment requirements are in-line with the scope of the SCDS contract.  The SCDS contract will be managed by SYSW/OS. Detailed system descriptions for SCDS programs will be presented at the Industry Day.

The sustainment requirements of the SCDS contract are broken into five functional areas: 1) Depot Support, 2) Studies & Analysis, 3) System Upgrades and Modifications, 4) Rapid Reaction Capability Transition to Operational Systems, and 5) Organizational Level Maintenance.  Depot support consists of the following: depot and sustainment engineering (D&SE), repairable and disposable item management, stock, storage and issuance of spares, hardware and software maintenance and repairs, sparing level analysis, etc.  Studies and analysis projects in support of the basic program mission includes, but is not limited to: analyses to reduce life cycle costs, improving availability and maintainability, the replacement of obsolete or /unsupportable equipment, the evaluation of future capability enhancements, preplanned product improvement (P3I), etc.  System upgrades and modifications may include the development, test, production and installation of system upgrades.  The transition of RRCs to operational systems includes activities such as developing technical orders (TOs), drawing packages, performing provisioning analysis and procuring spares and support equipment, and configuration management and standardization of hardware and software. Organization Level Maintenance is defined as on-site maintenance support at operational units.  

All attending contractors shall submit a Statement of Capabilities describing their qualifications to be the Prime contractor for the SCDS effort which includes information regarding experience with establishing public/private partnerships for depot support, contractor experience with transportable/deployable ground systems and information demonstrating compliance with the aforementioned security requirements. Each potential Prime must submit a Statement of Capability to Mr. Dwight Taeza at Dwight.taeza@losangeles.af.mil no later than the close of business on 6 July 2007.  

Responses from small and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions.

To attend the Industry Day each potential Prime shall submit a SF86 for each attendee. All attendees must have a current TS/SSBI and be briefed SI/TK. In addition all attendees must meet Tier 1 Special Access Programs adjudication standards. In those instances where an attendee is currently accessed to Air Force Special Access Programs sponsored by SAF/AAZ or SMC/SY, contractors shall submit only a Personnel Access Request (PAR) provided the individual has a current TS/SSBI. The justification will state "Access is requested to attend Sustainment Industry Day on 24 July." Block 1 of the PAR will be left blank. SF86's and PARs must be received NLT 11 July 2007. Any submissions which do not meet Tier 1 adjudication standards will be processed last and probably will not be completed in time to facilitate attendance. If there are any questions contact Mr. Gerald Crafton at (310) 416-1591 or gerald.crafton@losangeles.af.mil. 

All approved attendees will be indoctrinated at the Industry Day and details of the RFP and acquisition strategy will be disclosed at that time. Those potential Primes that wish to bid will be required to establish a SCIF IAW DCID 6/9 and the SCIF approved by SYSW security, in order to receive the RFP. Contractors may submit their Fix Facility Checklist (FFC) at the same time the personnel security paperwork is submitted. Additionally, contractors will be required to submit a CONOPS identifying how information systems will be configured within the proposal area and information restricted to only those participating in the proposal effort. A full fledge DCID 6/3 ISSP will not be required for the RFP; only the CONOPS is required. If a contractor has a SCIF that is vacant and it is currently accredited by another agency, that SCIF can be used for the proposal effort. Contact Mr. Crafton regarding information/paperwork that will be required. SYSW will attempt to leverage the other agency?s accreditation documentation instead of requiring the submission of a completed FFC.  While possessing an accredited SCIF is not a requirement to participate in the 24 July 07 Industry Day, no potential offeror will be given access to the classified SCDS RFP without having a secure SCIF to store the information in. 

Each potential Prime team will be authorized a total of 40 quotas for the RFP effort.  SYSW Security will not process any more than 6-8 access requests until an approved facility is established and the 24 July 07 Industry Day has been completed. If you submit more than 8 access packages prior to industry day, identify the eight that will be attending the industry day as they will be processed first.

BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call Mr. James H. Gill SMC/PK.  You can reach him at James.Gill@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-1789.

DECLARATION:  This publication is for information only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Government sponsorship of contractor charges against any Government contract for attendance or proposal efforts, or a Government promise to pay for any information received in response to this announcement.

Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.   Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, management and key personnel qualifications, technical and organizational approach, and on their price proposals.

The acquisition shall consist of four (4) phases:  Phase 1 ? Receipt and evaluation of technical offers and of initial price proposals.  Phase 2 ? Develop an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms.  In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not it will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors on the basis of GSA's opinion.  GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3.  Phase 3 ? A determination of the competitive range shall be developed by the Contracting Officer.  Phase 4 ? Completion of negotiations with firms in the competitive range, if necessary.  Receipt and evaluation of final proposal revisions.  

Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are more important than cost or price.  The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 3, without negotiations.  The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance:  1. Past Performance, 2. Management and Key Personnel Qualifications, and 3. Technical and Organizational Approach.  The NAICS code applicable to this project is 236220.  This unrestricted procurement is being conducted under full and open competitive provisions in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.

<DESC>Description:  The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), located at Scott Air Force Base, IL intends to award a sole-source contract to AT&T Corp. for MObile Ground Entry Point Service (MOGEPS).  MOGEPS is a specialized telecommunications service needed to continue similar service previously delivered by AT&T Corp. under contract DCA200-95-C-0080.  The purpose of MOGEPS is to provide air-to-ground communications capability to certain suitably equipped aircraft performing special missions anywhere in the world.  Examples of aircraft supported are E-4B National Airborne Operations Center aircraft, E-6B Airborne National Command Post Aircraft, Air Force One, and other Air Force and Navy aircraft operating in support of the National Command Authority and National Military Command System.  MOGEPS will extend the reach of the U.S. Air Force Northstar Network to these aircraft as they occasionally operate in areas not served by Northstar.  To provide this service the contractor shall maintain two teams of personnel and portable equipment ready at all times to travel to required service locations on a minimum of twenty four hours notice.  The contractor shall provide full duplex, 15 channel, voice and data communications service over a T-1 circuit path.  The MOGEPS equipment shall link with an airborne aircraft via Ultra High Frequency radio utilizing military frequencies, or via physical connection when an aircraft is on the ground.  Within the Continental U.S., MOGEPS shall normally link to Northstar via use of a terrestrial circuit, which will be provided by the Government.  Outside the Continental U.S., the link to Northstar will normally be via a contractor arranged Ku, C, or X band satellite link back to the U.S.  MOGEPS equipment must be compatible with the legacy terminal equipment aboard the aircraft served, as the Government is not in a position to replace existing aircraft terminals to be compatible with new design MOGEPS equipment using different technology.  The aircraft terminals currently in use are based upon customized military equipment no longer manufactured, combined  in unique equipment configurations, using custom telecommunications software, and producing signals with unique technical  parameters.  There are no acceptable commercial substitutes for the equipment and software in use.  Performance of this contract requires access to classified telecommunications information.  MOGEPS team members must as a minimum have a secret security clearance.  No subcontracting opportunities are expected for this contract.  All inquiries regarding the procurement solicitation should be submitted electronically to Mr. Stan Schellenbach, Contract Specialist, e-mail stan.schellenbach@disa.mil, or Ms Lisa A. Boeckmann, Contracting Officer, e-mail lisa.boeckmann@disa.mil, no later than 14 May 2007.  NAICS Code 517110 is applicable to this acquisition.

<CONTACT>Helen Xiong 760-939-5124 John Watkins, 760-939-8158
<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, intends to procure a Linux Cluster Computer on a full and open unrestricted basis.  The cluster computer will be an architecture tailored for supporting scientific computing applications.  Typically, cluster computers consist of a single management node and any number of compute nodes assembled into one or more rack units.  There are requirements for a LINUX based operating system with cluster management software, high speed node interconnect network, memory, disk storage, power supply and system data backup capabilities.  Other than the necessary operating system software there is no application software being purchased.   The system as delivered must be a fully functional LINUX-based cluster computer requiring site-provided standard external power and normal air conditioning for cooling.  The following are minimum requirements.  Alteration of these requirements is acceptable if the functionality of the given !    requirement is met with other offered hardware or software.  CLUSTER HARDWARE:  1. One cluster management node:  a) 4 Gb memory  b) 250 Gb disk  2.  Compute nodes:  a) Minimum of 32 compute nodes b) Single dual-core processor or two single-core CPU's per compute node c) 2 Gb memory per compute node d) Vendor should provide pricing information that can be used to determine complete system cost for initial purchase of up to 64 compute nodes.  3.  Gigabit Ethernet internal cluster network.  4.  Ethernet external network capable.  5.  1 Tb usable RAID disk storage.  6.  Redundant power supplies on management and compute nodes  7.  Crash kit:  a)  Provides for immediate hardware replacement in case of specific system failures.  This should include a management node mother board, cooling fans, a disk for compute nodes and a RAID disk.  System architectures that provide redundant capabilities will not need to provide crash kit hardware for those specific hardware items.  8.   Ra!  ck mounted system monitor and keyboard.  9.  Rack mounted CD-ROM, CD-R , DVD-ROM, DVD-R (single drive meeting all requirements will suffice).  10. Uninteruptable Power Supply (UPS) capable of sustaining system operation for 10 minutes after external power outage.  Cluster system should be configurable to provide for automatic system shutdown at some predetermined time after external power outage.  System does not need to be able to automatically restart after a power outage.  CLUSTER SOFTWARE:  1. LINUX-based Operating System (OS).  2. Cluster Management Software.  3. System Management Software capable of managing user accounts, external network connectivity, system security, etc.  4. Health monitoring software capable of providing system performance data and diagnosing system failures.  5. There is no requirement for user job queuing software.  Standard system job scheduling is sufficient.  MISCELLANEOUS HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:  1.  Tape back-up system capable of      performing (1) full back-up of the RAID array and daily partial back-ups for !  two weeks (10 partial back-ups) assuming that no more than 20% of the RAID storage is required to be saved in any single partial back-up.  Magnetic tape is specified as the "minimum".  Other options may be acceptable.  2.  Vendor must provide facility requirements including: a)  Total power including number and type of power connections.  b)  Total system cooling requirements, preferably in Btu/hr.  c)  System floor space requirements.  INSTALLATION AND WARRANTY: 1. Vendor must provide complete maintenance coverage for hardware and system software for a period of three years.  2. Vendor must provide the cost for optional hardware and system software maintenance for two additional years.   SYSTEM PERFORMANCE:  1. Vendor must provide system performance data for a benchmark case provided by the Navy.  The application software can be obtained (free of charge) from the POC provided below.  There are  a number of options for compiling, linking, and target processor.  The applicat!  ion uses standard MPI libraries.  The specific application is OVERFLOW  2.1a.  The specific benchmark case may have been executed prior to responding to this acquisition on a representative system (same CPU, internal network, memory and disk architecture).  If this is the case, the vendor may provide the benchmark data for that system and note any differences between that system and the quoted system which could affect the benchmark results as well as how the benchmark would be affected.  2. The system must be capable of running both 32-bit and 64-bit applications.  3.  The system should allow for portability of software vendor applications.  At a minimum, it should be expected that a vendor's application that has been compiled on a similar architecture should run on the quoted system without being compiled on the quoted system.  Stated differently, there should be no system or vendor specific restrictions on porting applications.  For instance, it should not be required, on the quoted system, to use unique vendor supplied libraries (MPI, etc.)!   in order to run an application code.  It may be that performance optimization could be enhanced by recompiling and linking on the quoted system, but it should not be required, in general. Complete details will be provided in the solicitation or Request for Quote (RFQ).  The proposed LINUX Cluster Computer must meet or exceed performance specifications as listed in the solicitation.  The solicitation will be posted in the Navy Electronic Commerce Online website at http://www.neco.navy.mil and the FEDBIZOPPS website at http://vsearch2.eps.gov/servlet/SearchServlet on or about 28 June 2007.  All responsible sources must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at the following website: https://www.ccr.dlis.dla.mil/ccr/scripts/index.html.  Responses must include all information requested in the   written RFQ.  All responsible offers will be considered for award.  This evaluation will be in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.

The Signal Generator is used to perform ground testing of critical navigation equipment for the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), International Space Station and Space Shuttle programs in the Guidance Navigation and Control (GN&C) Integrated Test Facility, Orion Avionics Test Facility (Kedalion) and the Navigation Systems and Technology Laboratory. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Spirent Federal Systems.  The GPS Signal Generators were originally built by Global Simulation Systems, Inc.  Portions of Global Simulation Systems business, including manufacturing and maintenance of GPS Signal Generators, was purchased by Spirent Federal Systems.  Due to the proprietary nature of the GPS Signal Generators design, Spirent Federal Systems is the only vendor authorized to perform hardware and software maintenance and upgrades to the STR4760, GSS6560 and GSS7700 systems. The existing STR2760 units and controlling computer are tightly integrated within the Guidance, Navigation and Control (GN&C) Integrated Test Facility (GITF). The existing system has four RF outputs. International Space Station (ISS) simulations require the four RF outputs to enable accurate modeling of the ISS vehicles GPS equipment.  Upgrading the existing STR2760 to the GSS7700 will not impact existing simulation environment (ie simulation or software modifications). The GSS7700 utilizes the same interfacing software program (SimGEN) and hardware, which is utilized in the GITF. The GSS7700 is compatible with the ISRS Inertial Nav System Test Units and are used for testing GPS/INS units flying on ISS.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 06, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>CONTACT TIM CARSON AT timothy.h.carson@nasa.gov ONLY FOR TECHNICAL ISSUES REGARDING THIS NOTICE, AS WELL AS FOR QUOTES. CONTACT INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND IN THE BODY OF THIS NOTICE************** NASA/MSFC has a requirement for: 1. Training 1 Job 2. Ultrasonic Camera 1 EA 3. 1 Mhz 1 Job 4. 2.25 Mhz 1 Job 5. Aluminum Plate with holes 1 EA NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Impeerium, Inc. for the following reasons: 1. NASA has a requirement to inspect complex composite structures on the Ares I launch vehicle both during and after assembly and testing.   Inspection locations include areas with severe access limitations where a lightweight, handheld tool is necessary to allow the inspection to be performed.  Imperium Inc. is the sole known provider of a commercially available, handheld ultrasonic camera designed for nondestructive evaluation applications.  2. Conventional ultrasonic C-scans rely on bulky, complex robotic tooling to move the transducer over the part methodically to provide complete inspection coverage.	Such tooling will be impossible to set up in some locations of the Ares I.  Imperiums ultrasonic camera provides the only practical method of performing an ultrasonic inspection in some locations of the vehicle. 3. The US patents were searched on-line along with all pertinent vendors with similar ultrasonic marketing that could supply an ultrasonic camera capable of single sided inspection of aerospace structures.  The only vendor that we could find who markets such a product in this category is Imperium Incorporated. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 25, 2007.

The MCA Threshold Program is implemented under a Strategic Objective Agreement with the Government of Tanzania (GOT). Its goal is to strengthen the institutional capacity of the GOT to build and promote stronger partnerships among the government, the private sector and civil society to combat corruption.

In the Threshold Program, the GOT's principal objective is to reduce corruption in half of the country's local districts and
in central government agencies. The Threshold program contains the following strategic objectives over the two-year period of the program:

1) An increase in the number of local government authorities participating in public expenditure tracking.
2) An increase in the number of investigations by the Prevention of Corruption Bureau that result in an anticorruption case being presented in court.
3) An increase in the media exposure of anti-corruption cases brought to trial.
4) The establishment and operationalization of a Financial Intelligence Unit to investigate or report and bring to the attention of proper authorities and the public, cases of suspicious or unusual financial transactions.
5) The execution of a program of audits of selected central government ministries/departments/agencies and local government authorities over the 2-year period of the Threshold Program reported by the media.

To meet these objectives, the MCA Threshold Program is commencing activities in four areas:
a) civil society and media strengthening;
b) rule-of-law initiatives including support for a Legal Aid Network and training for investigators, prosecutors and magistrates;
c) support for establishing a Financial Intelligence Unit; and
d) a public procurement reform initiative which will involve the execution of local and national government audits as well as the training of investigators on corruption in procurement.

<DESC>SUBJECT: NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR the required components and precise installation of said components for a SYSTEM UPGRADE TO THE MR200 FOURIER TRANSFORM INFARED (FTIR) SPECTROMETER for the Air Force Research Laboratory, California. The Intent of Award is to LR Tech Inc., 42 Chemin du Boise, Lac Beauport, Quebec, Quebec, Canada G3B 2A5.


Description of Action: 

AFRL/PRSA requires an upgrade for the MR200 FTIR Spectrometer control and data acquisition components.  More specifically, the electronics would be replaced and a new software package to run the instrument would also be delivered.  The new software can be run on approved Air Force computers with modern operating systems.  These components are used to operate the spectrometer and record the data it produces.  This upgrade is necessary for AFRL to continue to meet in-house research program requirements and Missile Defense Agency support tasks.  

1.	Current Equipment Requirements;

a.	In general the system spectral resolution, frame rate, and spectral radiance sensitivity requirements have not changed.  The upgraded system must at least maintain the original system general requirements;
    
b.	Those requirements include:

i.	InSb detector Noise Equivalent Spectral Radiance (NESR) of 5X10-10 W/sr-cm2-cm-1 at 16 cm-1 spectral resolution;;

ii.	MCT detector NESR of 5X10-9 W/sr-cm2-cm-1 at 16 cm-1 spectral resolution;

iii.	1 - 128 cm-1 wavenumber resolution measurement capability with factor of two increments;

iv.	Frame rate capability from 10 to 82 Hz depending on spectral resolution;

v.	Two detector simultaneous measurement capability;

vi.	Scan speed up to 375 kHz;

vii.	Field of view uniformity: Maximum of +/- 10% over 70% of the measured FOV;

viii.	Gain control from 1 to 64 in factor of two increments;

ix.	Both forward and reverse scanning (double sided) capability;

x.	Oversampling by a factor of 2;

xi.	16 bit analog to digital converters (ADC) for the detector output;

xii.	Software for real time interferogram and raw spectrum display;

xiii.	Software for basic data operations such as interferogram conversion to raw spectra, radiometric calibration, arithmetic functions, integration, display control, data file manipulation, and export to ascii;

xiv.	Data file format compatible with current AFRL data processing software;

2.	Additional Requirements for the Upgraded System;

a.	AFRL/PRSA requires additional functionality for current and future anticipated measurements.  This includes studies of much longer time events (several minutes), capture of millisecond scale temporal events, and accurate time stamping to correlate temporal events;

b.	More specifically these upgrade requirements include:

i.	Real time write to a hard drive for a minimum of 10 minutes;

ii.	System control and data acquisition software must be compatible with Windows XP and Linux operating system environments;

iii.	System data acquisition and control with a laptop computer to save weight and reduce system transportation costs;

iv.	IRIG B time stamp capability with an accuracy less than 1 millisecond;

v.	Improved measurement functionality to include partial, step, and static scan modes;

vi.	Both a 1 GB and 10/100 GB BaseT ethernet interfaces for fast data transfer;

vii.	One year warranty on parts and labor from date of system delivery. 

Place of delivery and acceptance is Edwards AFB CA 93524;

LR Tech Inc., 42 Chemin du Boise, Lac Beauport, Quebec, Quebec, Canada G3B 2A5 is the only known source that can satisfy the requirements of the Government at this time.

Please note that this is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the items listed above. 
Responses may be sent via e-mail to Mark.Carey@edwards.af.mil or mailed to AFFTC/PKTB, 5 South Wolfe Ave, Edwards AFB, CA 93524-1185, Attention: Mark Carey.  

Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Air Force not to open the requirement to open competition, based on response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Air Force.  If the office has not received any affirmative written responses by Close of Business (COB), 26 June 2007 a Sole Source purchase order will be pursued with to  LR Tech Inc., 42 Chemin du Boise, Lac Beauport, Quebec, Quebec, Canada G3B 2A5.

<DESC>The Mine Safety and Health Administration is issuing this pre-solicitation notice in anticipation of releasing a request for proposals (RFP) for architectural and engineering services and the subsequent construction of a data center at the National Mine Health and Safety Academy (NMHSA) located in Beaver, WV.  The NMSHA contracted for a preliminary site survey that determined the best location for the data center as an existing classroom in one wing of the Academy where classrooms are located
The National Mine Health and Safety Academy (NMHSA) was constructed in the 1970?s with the intent to provide a self-contained training facility for the Agency and the mining industry, including classrooms, dormitories, auditoriums, office space and meeting rooms.  Additionally, the NMHSA supports the DOL and MSHA Continuity of Operations Plans and, upon completion, the data center will be the backup network operations center for the Agency. The data center will house up to 30 equipment racks filled with computer file servers and telecommunications equipment such as routers and switches that will connect the data center to the DOL wide area network and the NMHSA local area network.  The data center will support all of the NMHSA computer needs, approximately one-half of the Agency?s computer and telecommunications needs, support the MSHA continuity of operations plan, and augment the department?s IT needs in the event of a national emergency. 

The room that will be used for the data center is a classroom that is approximately 750 sq. ft. sitting at the end of one wing of the main NMHSA facility. . A draft layout plan of this classroom will be provided to all attendees at the site visit to be conducted on July 18.  The preliminary site survey indicates that this is a feasible location for the data center.  The successful offeror will be required to provide a full set of architectural and engineering drawings with complete specifications for room construction, electrical, and data center environmental controls to satisfy, at a minimum, requirements that are industry standards for data centers.  The estimated cost of this project is between one million and five million dollars ($1,000,000 - $5,000,000)

The RFP requires all offerors to attend the mandatory site visit at the NMHSA on July 17-18 prior to participating in the competitive process.  Vendors who do not attend the site visit will not be considered for award. 

Due to security constraints, MSHA will provide existing facilities blueprints; previous site survey drawings; Academy schedules; and a list of other construction constraints only to those vendors that provide a statement of intent to submit a proposal on the project after attendance at a site visit to be conducted on July 17-18, 2007 at the Academy in Beaver, WV.  Vendors who receive blueprints or other documents will be required to sign non-disclosure agreements with MSHA regarding these documents.

Offerors are required to respond to this pre-solicitation notice by  4pm July 2, 2007 via e-mail to register for attendance at the site visit. Offerors will not be reimbursed for any travel or lodging expenses related to the site visit. The following information must be provided for registration:

-Company name; address; telephone numbers; web site; and any information on established contracts with Federal agencies.
-The names of persons attending the site visit with titles and telephone numbers.
- A brief summary of corporate capabilities regarding data center design and construction. (MS Word format or PDF preferred)

Directions to the Academy and an Agenda will be provided to firms who register for the site visit.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 USC 253 (c)(1), on behalf of the NIST/Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), with Hytec, Inc. of Los Alamos, New Mexico, for a PAXSCAN 2520 High Energy Detector, manufactured by Varian and distributed by Hytec, Inc.  
  
The Neutron Imaging Facility within the NIST/NCNR is a national resource which provides users from Industry, National Laboratories, and Academia the most advanced neutron radiography capabilities in the world.  In addition, the facility 
provides testing capabilities to users to test hydrogen fuel cells in situ with the neutron radiography capability.

The high energy detector functions within the Neutron Imaging Facility to capture neutron images to dynamically image water formed inside of a fuel cell at a rate of 30 images per second.  It is the heart of the Neutron Imaging Facility for fuel cell research.  

The Neutron Imaging Facility currently utilizes a PAXSCAN 2520 High Energy Detector.  The existing PAXSCAN 2520 was purchased in 2004, via full and open competition, under Request for Quotation Number SB1341-04-Q-0314.  The PAXSCAN 2520 being purchased is an identical replacement of the existing system.  In the event  of a failure of the existing system, NIST would immediately utilize this system in its place while the damaged system is repaired or replaced.  Without this equipment the facility does not operate.  

No other system would be an identical replacement of the existing system.  A different system could cause considerable hardship and an extended delay in re-engineering the facility.  The Neutron Imaging Facility going down would not only cause a financial burden to the Government, but would also risk damage to the reputation of NIST due to the national visibility of this program. 

This detector is a proprietary design built by Varian.  Hytec is the only vendor licensed to sell Varian equipment.  Therefore, Hytec, Inc. is the sole source for this equipment.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by July 6, 2007, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  	Molecular Devices SpectraMax M5 Multi-Detection Microplate Reader

Purpose/Brief History:

The research mission of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (PET) section of the Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB), NCI is to improve the efficacy and safety of therapy for childhood cancers through the clinical development of new drugs and studying the clinical pharmacology of anticancer drugs in children. The PET section has a comprehensive and integrated preclinical and clinical pediatric drug development and clinical pharmacology program. 

The PET section has extensive experience in designing, conducting and analyzing phase I and II clinical trials in children with recurrent or refractory cancers. Trials incorporate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic correlative endpoints in selecting the optimum dose, assessing the activity of the drug and comparing the clinical pharmacology of the agent to adults. These studies are dependent on the ability of the lab to accurately and sensitively quantify the concentration of the drugs and their metabolites in biologic matrices including plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. 

PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1)  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 
(2)  For sole source acquisitions of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.

Justification:


The technology for sensitively and accurately quantifying drug concentrations has advanced dramatically over the past 2 decades. The sensitivity of the microplate readers has improved greatly in the past 10 years. SpectraMax M5 is the only plate reader that is a spectrophotometer, absorbance and fluorescence detector which does the work of 3 detectors. It eliminates the purchase of costly filters with its dual monochromators to determine optimal excitation and emission settings. This plate reader can be used for 96 well and 384 plates simultaneously to determine the end point, kinetic, and spectra. In addition this instrument?s software is compatible with the existing Mac computers. This instrument is needed for the continuation of the ongoing and recently opened clinical trials of the POB, PET section (more than 25 trials) as well as the Neuro Oncology Branch (NOB).

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  Photokinesis accessory for ERS6 spinning disk confocal microscope

Purpose/Brief History:

The Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology (LCMB) investigates normal cellular signal transduction and aberrations in signaling pathways that are associated with neoplasias in humans and model systems.  The LCMB studies the role of oncogenes, growth factors immunoreceptors, and downstream effector molecules in neoplastic and normal cellular activation and proliferation. The goal of these studies is to decline cellular activation pathways, to identify mechanisms that induce cancer, and to provide possible diagnostic and preventative measures to utilize at the clinical level.

Particular emphasis has been placed on understanding signal transduction pathways mediated by activation of growth factor, cytokine, and T-cell receptors. Studies include the understanding of paracrine, autocrine, and juxtacrine activation of growth factor receptors, activation of T-cell receptors, chemotaxis, and the identification and analysis of effector and adaptor molecules that control proliferation, differentiation, and motility through these different pathways.

The photokinesis accessory for the UltraView ERS confocal microscope will enable more efficient performance of the LCMB?s work that is dependent on observation of dynamic microscopic structures in live cells.  The LCMB needs to analyze the dynamic behavior of intracellular organelles and proteins labeled with fluorescent probes including genetic tags like the green fluorescent protein (GFP).  To follow particular cohorts of dynamic structures we need to either photobleach or photoactivate arbitrary areas (any shape) in living cells while observing them with the UltraView ERS confocal microscope.  During studies photobleaching needs to be performed rapidly at any time during an imaging experiment.  Addition of photobleaching capabilities to the system is crucial for several scientific projects currently under investigation by the group including following the fate of T cell receptor subunits in T cell-B cell conjugates, monitoring the moving of vesicles in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and photoconversion of clustered molecules in activated Jurkat T cells.  

PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

The LCMB requires a photoactivation and photobleaching accessory that is compatible with its Government owned PerkinElmer UltraVIEW ERS 6FO-US spinning disk confocal microscope system.  The photoactivation and photobleaching shall have the following salient characteristics:  1) Photobleaching accessory must fit onto and work through the UltraView ERS 6FO spinning disk confocal;  2)  Photobleaching accessory must be controlled by the UltraView software including defining areas, selecting lasers and analyzing bleach patterns;  3)  Photobleaching must be available as both defined spots and arbitrary Regions of Interest (ROIs);  4)  Bleaching must be available ?on-the fly? during imaging and can occur anytime during imaging;  5) All lasers lines must be available for bleaching independently of imaging dichroics and 6)  The light path for bleaching must be separate from the imaging path used by the spinning disk confocal.

Perkin Elmer Life Sciences is the only vendor that can provide the equipment required and meets the NCI?s Researchers needs as detailed above.

This item is being procured as a commercial item in accordance with the procedures in FAR Pt. 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Pt.13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The requested items will be used for research at the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI), Bethesda, MD, and at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS). The use of other instruments may result in the loss of data when it is transferred from one machine of one make to one made by a different company. It is essential to buy the LAS3000 camera system to continue research productively if not, when transferring the data between both agencies the low intensity signals will fade away, and this will result in not detecting low-abundance molecules that are vital for research.

Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The US General Services Administration, Northeast & Caribbean Region intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a two-phase award of multiple firm-fixed price contracts to successful offerors to provide for an upgraded Smart Card Reader, to ultimately replace the existing Smart Card Reader to an existing Physical Access Control System (PACS).

The functional interface capabilities of the reader must include Contact and Contact less, PIN/Keypad, and Biometric (fingerprint).  The smart card reader must be able to read multiple card formats, including legacy smart cards (based on GSC-IS v2.0) currently in use.  The smart card reader must be compliant with HSPD-12 and FIPS 201 and associated special publications (like NIST Special Publication 800-76 Biometric Data Specification for Personal Identity Verification).  Upon Government acceptance of an offeror(s?) fully operational smart card reader that is in full compliance with all specifications listed, for the second phase, the offeror(s) will then be issued an RFP for the replacements, additional spares, and maintenance requirement to replace the existing Smart Card Reader to the existing PACS, fully and wholly integrated with the PACS software as a fully operational and functional system. The GSA intends to award up to three contracts. The contractor(s) shall perform all work necessary to ensure complete day-to-day performance operational capabilities of the new smart card readers, to be incorporated into existing ACS Optical Portals.  The spares award will provide for future quantity acquisition of spare parts and additional readers as needed by the GSA and other Government agencies.  The accepted smart card reader product solution resulting from Phase One award must be listed on the GSA Approved Products List (APL) at the time of Implementation/full deployment and Cutover Process to be eligible for award in Phase Two.  This procurement is being solicited as an UNRESTRICTED requirement.    The applicable NAICS Code is 334119 with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. This requirement shall be procured under Best value continuum, employing the source selection process, trade-off methodology IAW FAR Subpart 15.101-1.  The evaluation factors for this requirement will include the following:  Technical approach and capabilities, Management Approach, Past Performance, and Price.  The Government reserves the right not to convene discussions with successful offerors.  All offerors, whose proposals have been evaluated to be the highest rated in technical, and whose proposed prices were determined to be fair and reasonable for award, may be subject to a background check prior to receiving an award.  The solicitation will be issued on or about 22 June 2007.  The duration of initial phase of the requirement is approximately 60 calendar days after the issuance of the Notice to Proceed.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE ADDS OO-ALC ITEMS TO THE COMPETITION LIST.  SEE NEW UPLOADED LIST.




The Aircraft Structures Commodity Council at Robins AFB, GA is pleased to announce a strategic enterprise-wide long term strategy for Bonded Aircraft Structures in Federal Stock Class  (FSC) 1560.   Our intent is to consolidate individual competitive tactical buys into multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) firm fixed price contracts for a 10 year period.  IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY FURNISHED A BONDED PART IN THE 1560 FSC TO THE GOVERNMENT, YOU WILL NEED TO READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY TO DETERMINE IF YOUR ITEMS ARE INCLUDED.

This strategy is divided into items for a small business set aside and items for a full and open competition.  THIS NOTICE IS FOR THE FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION RFP.  Items applicable to this action are listed on the attachment.  The government reserves the right to add items to this list at a later date, however, those items will be published as an addendum to this synopsis in FedBizOpps. The estimated value of this contract action is $40 million with a three year basic ordering period with 2 three-year options and 1 one-year option.  FAR 15 procedures apply.     

The purpose of this strategy is to include all bonded structures stock numbers so that administrative lead time may be minimized.  All stock numbers that apply to this strategy are listed on the attachment.  Delivery will be established for each line item on applicable delivery orders when competition is conducted.    

A draft RFP will be issued prior to the final RFP and a pre-proposal conference will be held after the draft RFP is issued.  Date and location will be specified at a later date through synopsis in FedBizOpps or you may contact the buyer by e-mail (Denise.Pollard@robins.af.mil) or phone (478-327-3633) to be put on a mailing list for updates.

<DESC>The Global Systems Positioning Wing will post the final Request for Proposal number FA8807-06-R-0001 for the GPS IIIA Space Vehicle to the GPS Bidders Library ON OR BEFORE 29 JUNE 2007.  The Navstar GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS IIIA will maintain constellation sustainment, provide existing capabilities, plus introduction of a new L1C civil signal, increased earth coverage M-code power for authorized military users, a graceful growth path to achieve full CDD threshold requirements, and continuing support for the NDS mission, to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users.  GPS IIIA is an Acquisition Category 1D program.  The GPS must comply with 10 United States Code (USC) 2281 that requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 42 USC ? 14712 and comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.  This acquisition effort executes these statutory mandates.

BIDDERS LIBRARY:  
The RFP and attachments can be found under Bidders-Block III at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/.  

The DoD recently mandated the Public Key infrastructure (PKI) requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to verify users via digital identification certificates, rather than via a username and password, before granting access. 

In order to access the Bidder's Library and view the GPS IIIA RFP or any of the afore mentioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components: 

(a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or 
(b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html). 

This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee. 
OMBUDSMAN:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels.  The Ombudsmans role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror?s concern on a non-attribution basis.  The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror.  The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition.  The Ombudsman is Mr. John Wagner, and he can be reached at john.wagner@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-2138.

<DESC>The U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) is requesting Industry Day participation relating to the Space Control Depot Support (SCDS) Sustainment Contract.  This event is scheduled for 24 July 2007 from 0800 - 1200 PST at the A-8 Auditorium of The Aerospace Corporation, 2350 E. El Segundo Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245.  Following the presentation and general Q&A session, the Space Superiority Operations Support and Sustainment Division (SYSW/OS) will conduct one-on-one discussions with all interested Industry Day attendees.  Each Prime contractor will be authorized 6-8 personnel at the forth coming Industry Day.  One of the attendees must be a security person. One-on-one sessions will take place on the 24th immediately after the Industry Day presentation and if needed the 25th & 26th.   Each one-on-one session will be 45 minutes unless there is a need to shorten the sessions to 30 min due to the number of interested contractors.

On 26 January, 2007, the initial Industry Day for SYSW Sustainment Support was conducted.  Since then the government has revised its strategy and acquisition approach. The original approach was to award multiple contracts through an IDIQ contract and is now revised to award a single contract. This industry day, the Government team will brief attending contractors on the updated goals, requirements and strategy for acquiring sustainment support services for the various SMC/SYSW ground-based deployable systems.  The programs supported by this contract include: the Counter Communication System (CCS) Family of Systems, the Space Test and Training Range (STTR) Family of Systems, the Rapid Attack Identification Detection and Reporting System (RAIDRS) Family of Systems and Rapid Reaction Capabilities (RRCs), along with any future deployable SYSW system whose sustainment requirements are in-line with the scope of the SCDS contract.  The SCDS contract will be managed by SYSW/OS. Detailed system descriptions for SCDS programs will be presented at the Industry Day.

The sustainment requirements of the SCDS contract are broken into five functional areas: 1) Depot Support, 2) Studies & Analysis, 3) System Upgrades and Modifications, 4) Rapid Reaction Capability Transition to Operational Systems, and 5) Organizational Level Maintenance.  Depot support consists of the following: depot and sustainment engineering (D&SE), repairable and disposable item management, stock, storage and issuance of spares, hardware and software maintenance and repairs, sparing level analysis, etc.  Studies and analysis projects in support of the basic program mission includes, but is not limited to: analyses to reduce life cycle costs, improving availability and maintainability, the replacement of obsolete or /unsupportable equipment, the evaluation of future capability enhancements, preplanned product improvement (P3I), etc.  System upgrades and modifications may include the development, test, production and installation of system upgrades.  The transition of RRCs to operational systems includes activities such as developing technical orders (TOs), drawing packages, performing provisioning analysis and procuring spares and support equipment, and configuration management and standardization of hardware and software. Organization Level Maintenance is defined as on-site maintenance support at operational units.  

All attending contractors shall submit a Statement of Capabilities describing their qualifications to be the Prime contractor for the SCDS effort which includes information regarding experience with establishing public/private partnerships for depot support, contractor experience with transportable/deployable ground systems and information demonstrating compliance with the aforementioned security requirements. Each potential Prime must submit a Statement of Capability to Mr. Dwight Taeza at Dwight.taeza@losangeles.af.mil no later than the close of business on 6 July 2007. P

Responses from small and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions.

To attend the Industry Day each potential Prime shall submit a SF86 for each attendee. All attendees must have a current TS/SSBI and be briefed SI/TK. In addition all attendees must meet Tier 1 Special Access Programs adjudication standards. In those instances where an attendee is currently accessed to Air Force Special Access Programs sponsored by SAF/AAZ or SMC/SY, contractors shall submit only a Personnel Access Request (PAR) provided the individual has a current TS/SSBI. The justification will state "Access is requested to attend Sustainment Industry Day on 24 July." Block 1 of the PAR will be left blank. SF86's and PARs must be received NLT 11 July 2007. Any submissions which do not meet Tier 1 adjudication standards will be processed last and probably will not be completed in time to facilitate attendance. If there are any questions contact Mr. Gerald Crafton at (310) 416-1591 or gerald.crafton@losangeles.af.mil. 

All approved attendees will be indoctrinated at the Industry Day and details of the RFP and acquisition strategy will be disclosed at that time. Those potential Primes that wish to bid will be required to establish a SCIF IAW DCID 6/9 and the SCIF approved by SYSW security, in order to receive the RFP. Contractors may submit their Fix Facility Checklist (FFC) at the same time the personnel security paperwork is submitted. Additionally, contractors will be required to submit a CONOPS identifying how information systems will be configured within the proposal area and information restricted to only those participating in the proposal effort. A full fledge DCID 6/3 ISSP will not be required for the RFP; only the CONOPS is required. If a contractor has a SCIF that is vacant and it is currently accredited by another agency, that SCIF can be used for the proposal effort. Contact Mr. Crafton regarding information/paperwork that will be required. SYSW will attempt to leverage the other agency?s accreditation documentation instead of requiring the submission of a completed FFC.  While possessing an accredited SCIF is not a requirement to participate in the 24 July 07 Industry Day, no potential offeror will be given access to the classified SCDS RFP without having a secure SCIF to store the information in. 

Each potential Prime team will be authorized a total of 40 quotas for the RFP effort.  SYSW Security will not process any more than 6-8 access requests until an approved facility is established and the 24 July 07 Industry Day has been completed. If you submit more than 8 access packages prior to industry day, identify the eight that will be attending the industry day as they will be processed first.

BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call Mr. James H. Gill SMC/PK.  You can reach him at James.Gill@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-1789.

DECLARATION:  This publication is for information only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Government sponsorship of contractor charges against any Government contract for attendance or proposal efforts, or a Government promise to pay for any information received in response to this announcement.

<DESC>NOTE:  The Pre-Solicitation Notice dated Jun 8, 2007 is changed as follows:

1.  Delete paragraph 2A.
2.  Add the following:  2A.  Experience in Providing Design & Construction Services on Comparable Projects.  As a minimum, provide documentation evidencing offeror?s past experience on at least five (5) projects completed or in progress within the last ten (10) years that collectively best describe members of proposed D/B team experience providing design and construction services on projects with characteristics as comparable as possible to subject project (i.e., ?Bridging? project delivery; design/build delivery; adaptive re-use of existing building; historic rehabilitation; tight, urban sites; costs in excess of $20 million; LEED certified, BIM, etc.) 

Below is the minutes from the Pre-Solicitation Meeting held June 20, 2007.

On June 20, 2007 the General Services Administration conducted a Pre-Solicitation Notice Pre-Proposal Meeting for firms interested in responding to the pre-solicitation notice.  An overview of the information presented at this meeting is:

?	Bill Clark with Stevens & Wilkinson Stang & Newdow, the Bridging Architect, presented the general concept design of the project outlining the project scope and the design principles utilized in the development of the Bridging Contract Documents.
?	Buddy Hill, the General Services Administration Project Manager, reviewed the use of BIM (Building Information Modelling) to-date on the project, emphasized that GSA is a leader in the advancement of BIM and encouraged all proposers to utilize BIM to the extent technically and economically appropriate in the eventual development of the construction documents.  The selected design-builder will be provided with the Bridging Contract Documents in their native electronic form (either Revit or AutoCAD 2-D) for validation by the selected design-builder and the selected design-builder may elect to accept the work as their own or to develop their own electronic files.
?	Buddy Hill highlighted that the project will be registered with the U.S. Green Building Council and that it is a project goal to minimally-achieve a ?Silver? certification by USGBC.  The Bridging Contract Documents have been developed to allow the selected design-builder with flexibility in the way in which Silver certification points are accumulated, but it will be the responsibility of the design-builder to ensure that the project is executed and documented in a manner which will enable Silver certification.  Brookwood Program Management will administer the LEED submission process.
?	Buddy Hill provided an overview of the scope of the separate demolition and abatement contract which will be awarded during the month of June, 2007.  The design-build contract scope of work will be based upon a structural shell.
?	Glenda Burns, the General Services Administration Contracting Officer, reviewed the Advisory Multi-Step procurement process and offered the following clarifications to the Pre-Solicitation Notice:
1.	Section 2.A. of the ?Experience? section of the Technical Qualifications to be submitted by proposers will be changed.  (see above)
2.	The Technical Evaluation factors for the Phase II evaluation will include: 1) the Project Management Approach, 2) Qualifications and experience of Key Personnel, 3) Experience and 4) Past Performance.  The Price submitted as a part of the response to the Request for Proposal will be more important than the technical qualifications.
3.	In order to submit a response to the Request for Proposal, firms are REQUIRED to submit a response to the Pre-Solicitation Notification.

The following questions were addressed at the Pre-Proposal Meeting:
Q1. Has a construction start date been established for the project?
A1.	As a part of the Management Plan to be prepared in response to the Request for Proposal, proposers will provide a schedule for design and construction of the project.  GSA anticipates that an award of the design-build contract will be made in early November, 2007.  There will be no ?fast-tracking? of the project (i.e. no limited release on construction procurement or work prior to GSA?s acceptance of the completed construction documents from the design-builder.  GSA currently anticipates a start of construction in Q1 or Q2 2008.  GSA has flexibility in both the start and completion dates of construction.

Q2.	Can any of the structural work be performed prior to the design being complete?
A2.	No.  The Bridging Contract Documents will provide that the design-builder submit the construction documents in three phases for the purpose of GSA satisfying themselves that the construction documents are being developed in accordance with the requirements of the Bridging Contract Documents.  Upon completion of the final construction documents review, GSA will either exercise its contract option for the design-builder to proceed with construction or GSA may elect to pay the design-builder for the services rendered, take ownership of the construction documents, and procure the construction through other means.

    Q3.	Is a schedule to be provided as a part of the response to the RFP?
A3.	Yes ? See Answer 1.  GSA will provide proposers with the anticipated durations for construction document review to be incorporated into the project schedule within the Request for Proposal.

    Q4.	When will the Bridging Contract Documents be available?
A4.	The Bridging Contract Documents will be provided to all proposers following GSA?s receipt of an agreement from each proposer to secure all documents as ?Sensitive But Unclassified Documents.? GSA currently anticipates that the Request for Proposal (and the Bridging Contract Documents) will be issued in early August, 2007.

    Q5.	How much information is available about the existing building?
A5.	S&WS&N completed an as-built evaluation of the existing buildings, including an evaluation of the structural capacity of the load-bearing masonry/heavy timber construction, and this evaluation material will be provided ?for reference? with the Request for Proposal.  GSA will also provide survey information, geotechnical reports and other evaluative materials as reference documents.

Q6.	At the Industry Forum, a separate ?BA-54 Project? was discussed.  What is the status of that project?
A6.	The BA-54 project is renovation work required to the basement of the Elbert P. Tuttle Building to permit the relocation of mechanical equipment for the Tuttle Annex and to allow connection of the tunnel to be constructed under the Annex (BA-55) project with the Tuttle Building elevator and stairs.  Renovation work is funded separately from Major Capital work and, due to the separate funding sources, separate contracts are required.  However, the BA-54 work and BA-55 work will be awarded to the same design-builder.  The Requests for Proposal will include separate Bridging Contract Documents for each project.

Q7.	 Can the 90% complete Bridging Contract Documents be made available for review at a time and place different from the Pre-Solicitation Pre-Proposal Meeting?
A7.	The 90% Bridging Contract Documents can be reviewed at the offices of Stevens & Wilkinson Stang & Newdow at a mutually convenient time during the month of June to be arranged by contacting Bill Clark at bclark@sw-sn.com or 404.521.6202.

    Q8.	Can the buildings be photographed?
A8.	The exteriors of the Annex buildings can be photographed.  Federal security maintains a presence on Fairlie Street and you are advised to notify the officers on-site as to why you are photographing the buildings.  Since it is an operating federal courthouse, you are discouraged from photographing the Tuttle Building.

Q9.	Will the attendance sheet from the Pre-Solicitation Pre-Proposal Meeting be distributed?
	A9.	Yes.  It is attached to this Amendment.

    Q10.Are there any restrictions on the architectural and engineering firms who can be engaged as a part of the design-builder?s proposed team?
A10.	Stevens & Wilkinson Stang & Newdow and their consultants may not be a part of a design-builder?s team.  In addition to S&WS&N, those firms are:
IdeaSpan, Herrington Associates, Newcomb & Boyd (for security and data/voice engineering only), Hinman Associates, Costing Services Group, Elevator Advisors, Inc., B&E Jackson, BVM Engineering, L.F. Saussy and Environmental Graphics
Additionally, the following consulting engineering firms have been retained by Brookwood Program Management and are ineligible to participate as a part of a design-build team:
EDT, Inc., CFP Group, National Building Contractors, Commissioning and Green Building Solutions (CxGBS), and Diversified Environmental Management.

<DESC>Description:  Note as of 3 May 2007 the name associated with this acquisition has been modified from "Mobile Ground Entry Point Service (MOGEPS)" to "Transportable Communications (T-Comm) Service."  This modification is necessary to alleviate confusion with a similar name for another acquisition, and to meet other customer needs.  The service requirement itself is not changed in any respect.

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), located at Scott Air Force Base, IL intends to award a sole-source contract to AT&T Corp. for MObile Ground Entry Point Service (MOGEPS).  MOGEPS is a specialized telecommunications service needed to continue similar service previously delivered by AT&T Corp. under contract DCA200-95-C-0080.  The purpose of MOGEPS is to provide air-to-ground communications capability to certain suitably equipped aircraft performing special missions anywhere in the world.  Examples of aircraft supported are E-4B National Airborne Operations Center aircraft, E-6B Airborne National Command Post Aircraft, Air Force One, and other Air Force and Navy aircraft operating in support of the National Command Authority and National Military Command System.  MOGEPS will extend the reach of the U.S. Air Force Northstar Network to these aircraft as they occasionally operate in areas not served by Northstar.  To provide this service the contractor shall maintain two teams of personnel and portable equipment ready at all times to travel to required service locations on a minimum of twenty four hours notice.  The contractor shall provide full duplex, 15 channel, voice and data communications service over a T-1 circuit path.  The MOGEPS equipment shall link with an airborne aircraft via Ultra High Frequency radio utilizing military frequencies, or via physical connection when an aircraft is on the ground.  Within the Continental U.S., MOGEPS shall normally link to Northstar via use of a terrestrial circuit, which will be provided by the Government.  Outside the Continental U.S., the link to Northstar will normally be via a contractor arranged Ku, C, or X band satellite link back to the U.S.  MOGEPS equipment must be compatible with the legacy terminal equipment aboard the aircraft served, as the Government is not in a position to replace existing aircraft terminals to be compatible with new design MOGEPS equipment using different technology.  The aircraft terminals currently in use are based upon customized military equipment no longer manufactured, combined  in unique equipment configurations, using custom telecommunications software, and producing signals with unique technical  parameters.  There are no acceptable commercial substitutes for the equipment and software in use.  Performance of this contract requires access to classified telecommunications information.  MOGEPS team members must as a minimum have a secret security clearance.  No subcontracting opportunities are expected for this contract.  All inquiries regarding the procurement solicitation should be submitted electronically to Mr. Stan Schellenbach, Contract Specialist, e-mail stan.schellenbach@disa.mil, or Ms Lisa A. Boeckmann, Contracting Officer, e-mail lisa.boeckmann@disa.mil, no later than 14 May 2007.  NAICS Code 517110 is applicable to this acquisition.

<DESC>NOTE:  THIS  MODIFICATION IS TO CORRECT THE NAICS FROM 336612 TO 336611.



The United States Coast Guard Headquarters Acquisition Directorate intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the design, construction and delivery of a Fast Response Cutter B Class (FRC-B), with options for the construction and delivery of up to 57 more. The RFP is expected to be released on or about 22 June 2007 via the Federal Business Opportunity (FEDBIZOPPS) web page at www.fbo.gov.  Hard copies of the solicitation and specification will not be issued. It is incumbent upon offerors to monitor the FEDBIZOPPS web page for RFP release and all subsequent amendments. The standard industrial classification code is 3732 and the NAICS is 336611. The Coast Guard intends to conduct a full and open competition, with award being made on a best value basis.  Please direct all inquiries to the Contracting Officer via e-mail at Henrietta.K.Brisbon@uscg.mil.  For the information of Industry, the following preliminary details are provided:  


Mission Sets.  The following are mission sets that the FRC-B will be required to accomplish: Search and Rescue, General Law Enforcement, Drug Interdiction, Alien Migrant Interdiction Operations, Living Marine Resource Enforcement, Maritime Homeland Security/Defense, Defense Readiness Operations, Port Operations Security and Defense.  

In-Service Parent Craft Requirement.  The FRC-B design shall be based on an in-service parent craft meeting the following definition:

In-Service: The Parent Craft shall have been previously designed, built, and operated as a patrol craft in unrestricted service.  Craft originally designed and built for other service, which have been successfully modified for patrol service, and have operated successfully in patrol service, are acceptable.  Craft designed and built for other than patrol service, but as yet unproven in patrol service are not acceptable.  Patrol service shall mean (1) the craft incorporates accommodations, armament, electronics, and communications equipment similar to existing Coast Guard patrol cutters and/or the FRC-B COR; and (2) that the craft has operated in search and rescue, enforcement of laws and treaties, and/or military service.  A minimum of two such craft shall have been designed and built and one of these craft shall be designated the Parent Craft.  The Parent Craft shall have operated in offshore patrol service for a minimum of two years.  As an alternative, if only a single such craft proposed as a Parent Craft exists, it shall have operated in offshore patrol service for a minimum of six years.

The following shall be identical to the Parent Craft: a) Hull form and dimensions (defined as the underwater body and hull up to the sheer line of the Parent Craft); b) Underwater appendages type and configuration (i.e. Rudder position, shaft line, etc.); c) Type of propulsion (i.e. Diesel driven, Fixed pitch propeller, Controllable pitch propeller, Marine Water Jet, etc.); and d) Arrangement and configuration of the propulsion system (i.e., two engine, three engine, shaft angle, etc.).

Structural changes that do not vary the hull form will be allowed in order to meet the requirements for vessel classification, substitutions in the propulsion system, and the cutter boat launch and recovery system.  Examples of these changes include moving watertight bulkheads or providing an equivalent or higher strength hull material. 

The FRC-B full load displacement shall not vary by more than 10% from the Parent Craft full load displacement.  The FRC-B longitudinal center of gravity (LCG) at full load displacement shall not vary by more than 1% of the length on the waterline from the Parent Craft LCG at full load.

Principle Operating/Design Characteristics.  The principle characteristics of the FRC-B are: 120 ft - 160 ft overall length, 10 ft maximum draft, 28 knot minimum flank speed, independent operations for 5 days, crew size of 22, and the ability to safely launch and recover the cutter boat through sea state 4.  The RFP includes providing electronic navigation, communications, and surveillance systems.  The delivery schedule requires the lead cutter to be delivered 730 days after contract award.

Vessel Classification.  The American Bureau of Shipping, Guide for Building and Classing High Speed Naval Craft, 2007 (ABS HSNC Guide) shall be used in the design, construction, and classing of the vessel.  The FRC-B shall be classed as (Maltese Cross) A1, Circle E, HSC Naval Craft, (Maltese Cross) AMS, (Maltese Cross) ABCU SFA(35).

<DESC>Description
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (Committee), the Federal agency that oversees the AbiliytOne formerly Javits-Wagner-.O?Day (JWOD) Program, is seeking a U.S. commercial food manufacturers of a frozen biscuit and dough product line to partner with a selected nonprofit agency to furnish such products to the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (JWOD) Program. The products described must meet and/or exceed the FAR and other published Federal standards, including Executive Orders and applicable agency-unique requirements. To be considered for this commercial partner opportunity, the following criteria, at a minimum, must also be met: 

1) Possession of a nationally known brand name that can be demonstrated to have significant appeal through evidence of substantial sales.

2) Willingness to enter into a multi-year agreement, which includes technical assistance, with a nonprofit agency that meets the criteria of the AbilityOne Program to manufacture (in whole or in part), package, and distribute the products in question thereby creating employment for people who are blind or severely disabled. 

3) Commitment to working with the AbilityOne team to market the products to Government customers under the AbilityOne Program. 

4) Willingness to work with the nonprofit agency, NISH and the Committee to ensure that the products' price to end-users is a fair and reasonable price. 

Additionally, the partnership shall meet the following project specific criteria (appear in order of importance; proposals should address each criteria):

1) Willingness to establish a collaborative manufacturing process which allows for ?value added? tasks to be performed by individuals with severe disabilities through the AbilityOne Program.  Possibilities might include a) providing blended, dry bakery mix to nonprofit agency for dough mixing, extruding, cutting, freezing, and packaging; b) providing raw material ingredients to nonprofit agency for dry mix blending; c) providing dough to nonprofit agency for cutting, freezing, and packaging.  Respondents are encouraged to submit other collaborative manufacturing process scenarios, which allow for ?value added? tasks to be performed by individuals with severe disabilities.  Proposals can include multiple collaborative manufacturing scenarios.  Proposals that maximize employment for individuals with severe disabilities will be given preference.  Manufacturers' submissions shall indicate what functions the nonprofit agency's employees would perform.  

2) Performance history during the past 24 months (commercial and Government).  Past performance is defined as the manufacturer?s record of conforming to standards of good workmanship; adherence to delivery schedules; reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior; commitment to customer satisfaction; and an overall business-like concern for the interests of the customer.  Past performance will be used to determine whether the manufacturer has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and to timely delivery of quality goods at fair and reasonable prices.

3) Past experience with a same or similar co-branding partnership.  Proposals should include description of partnership; timeframe; partner diversity (small business, minority owned business, etc.); and results.

4) Past experience in Government sales of the frozen biscuit and dough product line.

5) Willingness to consider the potential for a ?Cooperative Arrangement with Industry (CAI)?, which would allow a nonprofit agency to lease the co-brand partner?s excess capacity (space and equipment) to be used and managed solely by the nonprofit agency to fulfill its role in the manufacturing of the frozen biscuit and dough product line.  Resulting agreement will comply with the Committee?s Operations Memorandum No. 21 (?Guidance on Nonprofit Agency Establishment of Subcontract Relationships for Current or Potential Procurement List Projects?).

6) Geographical location(s).

7) Manufacturer?s submission shall include their additional requirements for the nonprofit agency such as quality systems/certifications, proprietary information/non-disclosure agreements; defect liability; product recall; etc.

The deadline for response is [July 1, 2007].

NOTE: Proposals from current manufacturers of the frozen biscuit and product line are being sought. Submissions from retailers, resellers, or other entities of this type will not be accepted.  Proposals must satisfy all listed criteria in order to be considered for selection.  Manufacturers that cannot satisfy all listed criteria will not be eligible for selection.

The Government intends to negotiate this spares procurement under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c ) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The Government does not own data, drawings, or other specifications to permit full and open competition. Lockheed Martin STS is the designer, developer, and Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the OTPSs and is the only known source to have sufficient technical data, drawings, software, repair parts, and trained technical staff to maintain the OTPS. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Navy anticipates the award to be a firm fixed price contract. No solicitation will be available for this procurement.

<DESC>VERY LIGHT JET (VLJ) CAPABILITY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (CRFI) Phase II (21 June 2007 Update)

1.The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) Capabilities Integration Directorate, ASC/XR, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is submitting an updated Capability Request for Information (CRFI), originally issued 30 Jan 06.  In the initial notice, the Air Force requested information to help examine potential capabilities and military uses of the emerging aircraft class called Very Light Jet (VLJ).  This class is generally defined by a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) no greater than 10,000 lb, powered by one or two gas turbine engines, and a commercial list price less than $5M per aircraft.
Responses to the original notification were received and assessed during March 2006, including the potential to conduct flight evaluations of offered aircraft.  The result of this assessment was that, while these aircraft offer some potential military capabilities at an attractive cost, none of them had been FAA certified at the time.  Therefore, the Air Force elected to suspend further investigations until the FAA certified more than one aircraft.  As indicated in de-briefing sessions with the original CRFI responders, the Air Force has monitored the certification progress of these aircraft and now understands more than one has been certified by the FAA.  Consequently, the Air Force is hereby re-opening discussions with industry to examine potential VLJ capabilities and military uses.  Additionally, as contemplated in the original CRFI, the Air Force is seeking to conduct flight evaluations of FAA certified aircraft in order to better understand their capabilities. 
This is a two part CRFI:  Part A requests information on how emerging commercial opportunities in the VLJ class might have military applications for new mission areas or replace existing mission capabilities, such as sensor platforms, communications relays, network gateways, unmanned platforms, etc. and how these aircraft might be adapted to fulfill those roles.  Part B requests updated capability information on FAA certified VLJ aircraft and their availability for qualitative flight evaluations by Air Force test pilots.
The submitted documentation becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.  No solicitation documents exist at this time.  This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this advertisement.  This is a request for information/market research announcement for planning purposes.  The Government will not reimburse costs associated with the documentation submitted under this request except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subpart 31.205-18, Independent Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Although the word ?proposed? may be used in this inquiry, your response will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.
Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry.  This announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation.  It does not commit the government to reply to information received, or to later publish a solicitation, or to award a contract based on this information.

2. This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the ?art of the possible? from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities.  The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future strategies for the possible uses of the VLJ aircraft class within the military.  Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such.  Any company proprietary information contained in the response should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, such that ?publicly-releasable? and ?proprietary? information are clearly distinguished.  Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure.  The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.

3. Part A: The Air Force is requesting information from appropriate companies or parties interested in providing novel uses of VLJ aircraft and approaches for adapting them to unique military missions.  We recognize that the VLJ business segment is for the most part commercially driven; thus, in addition to information from VLJ Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), the Air Force is also seeking innovative modification and/or partnering approaches from traditionally defense-focused companies.  We are interested in innovative uses of VLJs where this class aircraft could provide either unique capabilities or an attractive performance/cost benefit to the Air Force.  The following are examples of missions which the VLJ class may be suited to perform: passenger/cargo transport, training, Homeland Defense, signals intelligence (SIGINT), surveillance, reconnaissance, communications relay, airborne communications gateway, and electronic combat.  Industry responses should rank order the missions their proposed VLJ variant may be best suited to perform, with strengths and weaknesses of each mission discussed in three pages or less per mission.  As this is not an exhaustive list, the Air Force requests identification of any additional missions or innovative or novel uses that industry believes this class of aircraft could perform.  The Air Force also requests information on potential technical and business approaches for modifying/adapting VLJ aircraft (e.g., modifications to add sensors, add additional fuel capacity, provide remote piloting, etc.) to perform these unique or beneficial missions.
Part A should include: (1) a cover page containing identification of the company CAGE code, street address, and business size for NACICS code 336411 (aircraft manufacturing) and the names and telephone numbers of the technical point of contact (POC) and the overall company POC in paragraph 4 above (in the case of a partnership, please provide appropriate CAGE codes and POC information for the lead company), (2) a summary statement indicating the company?s (or team?s) ability and willingness to make its VLJ available for a qualitative flight evaluation whether at Edwards AFB, CA or an alternate location of a company's choice; (3) a thorough aircraft description, including technical and general data summarized in the table titled Technical & General Vehicle Parameters Summary and descriptive text to provide additional detail; and,(4) a four page (max) description for each viable mission to include modifications needed to adapt the aircraft to the specific mission or use, and Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimates of the costs, schedules, and risks to perform these modifications.  Part A responses are limited to 45 pages inclusive of the four page mission description(s) (modifications, costs, schedule, and risks)..
Part B: In this part, the Air Force requests current information on the availability of proposed VLJ aircraft for qualitative evaluations (qual evals) and the responder?s approach to supporting limited qualitative evaluations (qual evals) of that aircraft.  The qual evals will be conducted by fully qualified Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) test pilots and are intended to assist the Air Force in examining potential military missions that this class of aircraft may be suited to perform.  The Air Force desires to perform these qual evals at either Edwards AFB, CA or at a location of the interested party?s selection.  The qual evals are being used to investigate aircraft characteristics and will not require any permanent modification or change to the aircraft.
If you respond to Part B, your responses should include (in addition to your Part A response): (1) identification of cost, personnel, and risk of loss considerations associated with qual eval flights that need to be addressed by the parties prior to conducting qual eval flights; and, (2) the respondents? preferred business approach and methodology for conducting qual evals. Part B responses are limited to 25 pages.

4.  Broad industry participation in this VLJ Phase II CRFI is encouraged and information on VLJ aircraft that have not yet achieved FAA certification is acceptable.  Companies/teams planning to provide a capability response should identify, to the Air Force point of contact (POC) named below, the name of their company, address, telephone number, and name and position of the individual to contact for future dialogue.

5.  Technical parameters, likely concepts-of-operation, mission performance assessment results, and price will all be considered during this AF VLJ capability assessment.  Upon the conclusion of our effort, participants will be provided a summary of the Air Force assessment of their respective aircraft/approach.

6.  Companies are not limited to a single aircraft configuration for this RFI; however, each VLJ aircraft configuration must be clearly identified in a separate Part A response.  Submissions are requested within 45 days of this announcement and may be made by e-mail or mailing your response on a compact disk to: Mr. Terry Hudson, (937) 255-5763, Contract Negotiator Terry.Hudson@wpafb.af.mil, ASC/577AESG/PK (Bldg 28, Rm. 219, 2145 Monahan Way) Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7017 with a notice of delivery to: Mrs. Pat Krabacher,(937) 904-4501, Contracting Officer patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil, ASC/XRS (Capability Planning Div, 2275 D St., Bldg 16, RM 0053) Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7217.  Personnel hand-carrying responses should contact the Contract Negotiator to arrange a mutually acceptable arrival time.

7.  U.S. and non-U.S. firms are permitted to respond to this VLJ capability RFI.  Responses to questions from interested parties will be promptly answered and posted on PIXS/FBO, unless some release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a question peculiar to a Company or that Company?s response.  Post submittal one-on-one information sessions with respondents are not contemplated.  They may be offered to responders to clarify understanding of their submittal, the capability ramifications, or to discuss their business approach to the qual evals.  Information feedback sessions may be offered to respondents after the CRFI assessments are completed.

8.  Further AF interest in VLJ will be dependent on the results of this VLJ Phase II CRFI capability assessment (including mission performance assessments) and Air Force operational requirements analyses and determinations.  Future purchasing or leasing agreements may be sought to obtain aircraft in order to temporarily or permanently modify them with mission and/or instrumentation equipment for more extensive evaluation.  These additional comprehensive evaluations would be contingent on the Air Force determining there are viable operational missions for the VLJ.  This effort would entail initiating an acquisition program to acquire that new capability via a separate announcement on FBO.

9.  Technical point of contact is Mr. Patrick Fillingim, ASC/XRS Bldg 16, (937) 904-4417, or Mr. Eric Crawford, ASC/XRC Bldg 28, (937) 255-2649.  This notice may be updated as additional information becomes available.  Please check the FBO site for updates to this Phase II announcement under Very Light Jets (VLJ) Capability Request for Information (CRFI) and register to receive e-mail notices of any updates to the FBO announcement.  For more information on "VERY LIGHT JET (VLJ) CAPABILITY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)", please contact the AF POCs using e-mail to all four POCs listed below.

<CONTACT>TANGEE BROOKIE PURCHASING AGENT  3032369322     ;
<DESC>The U. S. Geological Survey, Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team is conducting research on genetic evidence of connectivity between grizzly bear population inhabiting the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) and the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE) population.  Results will be used to fulfill genetic monitoring requirements for the distinct population segment (DPS) of grizzly bears occupying the GYE as specified in the Final Rule (FR) removing the Yellowstone DPS of grizzly bears from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife.  The primary task for genetic monitoring specified in FR is to document natural connectivity, or lack thereof, between the GYE-DPS and the NCDE grizzly population using genetic samples from all captured or dead bears.  Gene flow between these two populations will be detected by using an "assignment test" which identifies the ecosystem from which individuals are most likely to have originated based on their unique genetic signature.  This technique also has the ability to identify bears that may be the product of reproduction between GYE and NCDE bears.  The assignment tests require that the same 16 microsatellite markers used to genotype NCDE bears also be used in the GYE-DPS.  Analyses of grizzly bear hair, tissue and/or blood samples from the GYE using the following 16 microsatellite markers:  G1D, G10B, G10P, G10J, G10M, G1A, G10H, MU59, MU50, G10C, MU23, G10L, CXX20, CX110, G10U, and G10X.  Contractor shall conduct assignment test to determine if genetic evidence indicates any GYE sampled individuals (or their parents) originated in the NCDE population.  The assignment test requires comparisons between GYE and results completed by Wildlife Genetics International for the NCDE population.  It is critical that the results of these analyses have an error rate of less than one percent.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the services specified as a sole source from Wildlife Genetics International, 610 Railway Street, Nelson, BC V1L 5P9 Canada, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials, which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such document without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice to the procurement.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services and supplies described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 15 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey, National Geomagnetism Program, has a requirement for services to provide web-based graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to facilitate the in-house monitoring of its data acquisition systems. These GUIs must utilize existing Earthworm protocols developed by the USGS Seismology Program, and must interface onto existing Seismology and Geomagnetism Program database systems.  Specialized experience is needed in order to ensure a tidy interface and standardization with the existing software infrastructure.  Extensive knowledge of and experience with developing real-time software for geomagnetic data display is required; in particular, previous experience working with SCNL coding, Earthworm protocols, and Earthworm waveservers is imperative in order to achieve standardization in database development between the Seismology and Geomagnetism Programs.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the services and supplies specified as a sole source from Instrumental Software Technologies, Inc., 70 Cereus Way, New Paltz, New York, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services and supplies are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This is NOT a Request for Quote (RFQ); the Government does not anticipate issuing a written solicitation.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management, SAS, plans to award a simplified acquisition on a sole-source basis to CHD Research Associates, Inc., on behalf of the Agency for Health Research and Quality (AHRQ), Center for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety.  The purpose is to analyze trends in national and state measures of hospitalization among home health and nursing home patients.  Many home health and nursing home patients are hospitalized and in many cases, rehospitalized, after start of care, with resulting high costs.  There is interest in examining these national and state hospitalization rates as measures of quality and disparity, especially the extent of state and agency/facility variation, and how these rates have changed over time.  The overall hospitalizations rates will be further refined by potentially preventable indicators for use in the 2008 National Healthcare Quality and National Healthcare Disparities (NHQR/DR) Reports to Congress.   

Using existing (and updating files through latest available calendar year) home health and nursing home patient level files containing either Minimum Data Set (MDS) or Outcomes and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) assessment data merged with Medicare claims data, the following rates will be calculated:  (a) Overall national and state rates hospitalization rates occurring within specified time periods after start of care for: i.  Medicare Home health patients  (calendar years 2000-2005); ii.  Medicare Skilled nursing facility (SNF) patients (calendar years 1999-2005); iii.  All nursing home residents with MDS assessment (regardless of being in Medicare SNF episode for 1999-2005).  (b)  National and state potentially preventable hospitalization rates (using the AHRQ Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs) methodology and any additional ICD codes specified by the Government) to determine how many of the hospitalizations of home health and nursing home  patients occurring within specified time periods after start of care are potentially preventable.  These rates would be calculated for the 3 groups for the same time periods stated above.  (c)  Estimate actual PQI rates for home health and nursing home users and for important subgroups of users--for example, patients with a history of each PQI condition, a history of recent hospitalization, and users living in different geographic regions or being served by different types of agencies/facilities.  The contractor may apply previous work (to be supplied by the Government) on risk adjustment for home health/nursing home-related hospitalization rates, in order to improve the validity of comparisons.  (d)  National and state potentially preventable hospitalization rates for the racial/ethnic groups used in the NHQR/DR (sample size permitting); (e)  Overall agency- and facility-specific hospitalization and PQI hospitalizations rates for the specific time periods (for those providers with minimum sample size per year) for use in percentile rankings (e.g., top and bottom 10% or 25% for NHQR).  

CHD Research Associates, Inc. is uniquely capable of satisfying this requirement within the required time frame for the following reasons:  1.  CHD Research Associates, Inc. is the key processor of this data for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and is considered to be the expert on these files.  They created these unique linked files (e.g., Datalink and DataPRO) and they have run analyses of the merged data sets previously and know the idiosyncrasies of this data;  2.  They have continued to update these files, accounting for changes in Outcomes and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) and Minimum Data Set (MDS) so trends over time can be analyzed; 3.  They have existing access to the CMS main frame to run these massive 100% datasets which cannot be run on PCs.  The Agency for Health Research and Quality plans to use the nursing home and home health patient hospitalization measures for the 2008 National Healthcare Quality and National Healthcare Disparities Reports to Congress so these measures are needed by Spring 2008.

This simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source.  Interested concerns may identify their interest in and capability to satisfy the requirement within 15 days after the date of publication of this notice.  Capability statements may be submitted to Anthony Webb in Room 5-101, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857 or via email at awebb@psc.gov.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.  A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive acquisition is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Public Address (PA) Emergency Broadcast Systems (EBS) Computer Network Alerting System Upgrade 

The Air Force ISR Agency is currently seeking sources for a potential requirement for the enhancement of the Public Address, Emergency Broadcasting System,  and the Computer Network Alerting system throughout the Agency?s primary facility.
This is a Sources Sought Synopsis only. This is not a solicitation announcement. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the AF ISR agency to an ultimate acquisition approach.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement and requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement.  Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the AF ISR Agency to determine potential sources capable of fulfilling all requirements associated with supporting the installation or upgrade and maintenance of the Public Address, Emergency Broadcast System, and Computer Network Alerting System.
Responses must be submitted electronically to Gary Whitney, Contracting Specialist at gary.whitney@lackland.af.mil by 4:00PM Central Daylight Time on 02 Jul  2007. In the event that electronic submission is not possible, responses can be forwarded in hard copy to the following address: AF ISR Agency/A7KA, Attn: Gary Whitney, 102 Hall Blvd, Suite 258, San Antonio, TX. 78243.  If responses are mailed, they must be received by 02 Jul, 07.  No phone calls will be accepted.
Background: The existing Public Address system and Emergency Broadcast system needs to be upgraded to provide 100% coverage of offices, hallways, and common areas for immediate notification of high priority information, alerts, and guidance.  The system must provide a venue to supply cover music in the common areas and offices to provide a source of masking sound attenuation. The volume controls that are located in the office and common areas should have the ability to be energized for emergency broadcast regardless of switch position. The system should be able to alert personnel with a preparatory warning signal prior to the actual announcement. Equipment needs to be located conveniently for maintenance, but should be housed to prevent tampering. The system needs to provide an integration capability to provide computer alert notification to the PA system to supply one stop notification process. The system needs to have a backup power system in the event of a power failure.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Automated Appointment Reminder System Equipment and Services
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-SSA-RFI-LH001
<RESPDATE>070907
<ARCHDATE>07242007
<CONTACT>Leslie Hyman, Contract Specialist, Phone 4109659476, Fax 4109659560, Email leslie.hyman@ssa.gov - Michele Tubman, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-966-3297, Fax 410-966-9310, Email michele.tubman@ssa.gov
<DESC>SSA is seeking contractors who can utilize the existing Government owned Automated Appointment Reminder System (AARS) equipment to make telephone calls to the public to remind them of upcoming appointments.  For the past three years the equipment has been installed at the current contractor?s site in Richardson, TX.    New offerors proposing to use the existing solution will have to move the existing equipment to their own site.  SSA will bear no responsibility for the condition of the present equipment (hardware and software) after it is shipped to the new location.  Service days are Monday through Friday.  There must be no interruption in service. Shipment must be done during weekend hours with a return to service Monday morning.  The present contract will be expiring on February 29, 2008 and SSA intends on continuing the service for one base year and four (4) one-year options.

SSA will also consider offers for new solutions.  Any solution proposed must ensure that there is no interruption of the existing AARS service.

Whether offerors intend to use the existing equipment or propose a new solution, they will be totally responsible for the service, maintenance and support for the duration of the contract

The AARS will make at least 550,000 appointment reminder telephone calls per month for 2 SSA components.  These two components are the Office of Automation Support (OAS) and the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR).  OAS is located in Baltimore, MD and ODAR is located in Falls Church, VA.   This Automated Appointment Reminder System shall be capable of making calls within the United States and Puerto Rico, via Government provided Primary Rate Interface (PRI) service.

OAS will only require that messages be delivered and Management Information (MI) be provided to SSA. ODAR will require an interactive system that will allow the called parties to confirm they received the message and leave messages if they desire.  The system should retry calls after encountering a busy signal or ring no answer, and leave a message if encountering voice mail or an answering machine.

The vendor will download all appointment information and office address information from one of the two SSA computers.  The following describes the downloading requirements for OAS and ODAR.

OAS
The contractor shall provide the capability to interface with SSA?s national FTMS for electronic transmission of designated files from SSA to the contractor?s facility(ies).  The contractor must provide, at its expense, the equipment and operating software platform, and the file transfer software required at its location(s).
 
The contractor assumes all responsibility for configuration, maintenance, and troubleshooting of its equipment and software.  SSA utilizes, and the contractor must provide compatibility with, Connect:Direct software with SECURE PLUS using IP protocol product from Sterling Commerce, Inc.  The Contractor may implement this Connect:Direct with SECURE PLUS using IP, or personal computers/servers capable of running Connect:Direct with SECURE PLUS using IP protocol on NT or UNIX (i.e., IBM?s AIX, SUN or HP) platforms.

The contractor site is responsible for its Internet connectivity and Internet Service Provider.  SSA will not permit any private class A, B or C IP addresses, i.e., 10.xxx.xxx.xxx type IP addresses from external users on it on its network.  Prior to file transmission, the Contractor will be provided a suitable IP address for access to SSA?s network via a firewall.  SSA will provide the necessary subnet(s) for connection at the remote site.  The contractor shall be responsible for its own name/address translation to fulfill the intended purpose of data transfers.  SSA will provide Connect:Direct node information to the Contractor as required to accomplish file transfers.

ODAR

The Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR) has a separate process for providing their data to the contractor, building on the information described above.  The primary difference in the process is the manner in which the data is provided to the contractor.  

Through a process developed in ODAR, a file in .txt format is created Monday through Friday containing the records for the calls that are made on the day following the creation of the file.  The file name contains the creation date.  (The file created Monday night is used to make calls on Tuesday, etc.  The file created on Friday contains the data for calls made on Monday.)  Calls are not made on weekends.  The output from the process is sent via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to the vendor's server.  To avoid possible network traffic delays, this process occurs at 11:00 p.m., Eastern Time.  The file size is less than 1 MB in size.  Therefore, the download time is very short.  Data encryption is not an issue since ODAR does not send a complete SSN.  

The system should also provide Management Information (MI) regarding the number of calls made, the completion rate, the busy rate, etc.  The vendor will be required to provide all hardware, software, design, project management, implementation, and maintenance of this system.  
This not a request for proposal, therefore SSA will not honor or respond to written and/or verbal requests for copies of a solicitation or other information related to this announcement.  SSA will use this information in their assessment of capable sources.

Interested sources that believe they have the ability to perform the services required should submit a detailed statement of their capabilities in writing to Leslie Hyman, Contract Specialist, via email at Leslie.Hyman@ssa.gov. Please reference SSA-RFI-LH001 in the e-mail subject line.  Responses must be received by 3:00 p.m. EST on July 9, 2007.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO TAX AND TRADE BUREAU
TOBACCO MAINSTREAM SMOKE pH TESTING

MARKET RESEARCH


The Administrative Resource Center (ARC), an office within the Department of Treasury?s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) Scientific Services Division (SSD), is requesting information on the testing of tobacco mainstream smoke pH.  The Scientific Services Division of TTB would like to procure the services of a commercial laboratory to determine mainstream smoke pH of  tobacco products measured under the standard U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) smoking protocol.  

MISSION:
TTB?s mission is to collect alcohol and tobacco excise taxes; to ensure that these products are labeled, advertised, and marketed in accordance with the law; and to administer the laws and regulations in a manner that protects the consumer and the revenue, and promotes voluntary compliance.

BACKGROUND:
TTB is the newest bureau under the Department of the Treasury.  The main responsibilities of TTB include protecting the public and collecting revenue.  These responsibilities are carried out by developing regulations, conducting product analyses, and ensuring tax and trade compliance with the Federal Alcohol Administration Act and the Internal Revenue Code.

INFORMATION DESIRED FROM VENDORS:
TTB requires a mainstream smoke pH test of tobacco products to be performed by an independent ISO accredited contract laboratory, utilizing the following methods:
 
Gas-phase method:  The pH of mainstream smoke from cigarettes smoked under FTC conditions is to be collected on a puff-by-puff basis and measured using a pH meter.  This method shall measure pH of each puff (the gas-phase of smoke) and accurately record changes in pH during the smoking process.  In addition to obtaining the pH values for each puff, an average pH of the smoke is determined by averaging the median pH of the individual puffs.

Solution-phase method:  The pH of mainstream smoke from cigarettes smoked under FTC conditions is collected using two glass impingers placed directly behind the cigarette mouthpiece.  The impingers shall use 0.1M KCl solution to trap cigarette smoke. The trapping and measurement of pH with the impinger method shall strictly adhere to a fully validated method.

This RFI is being posted in order for BPD to assess the market in regard to the contractors that are available to provide these testing services. Please provide information in response to the following questions:

1.	Do you offer either or both of the listed test methods for tobacco products?  If so, please provide additional information in response to the following questions:

1.	What agencies/bureaus have you serviced?  Please provide point of contact information        
      and period of performance.
2.   Do you provide these tests and the corresponding reports as the Prime or as a      
      subcontractor?    Provide details.
3.   Do you subcontract any portions of the work, and if so, to whom and what portions?
4.	If you are an 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, did you perform at least 50% of the work provided?
5.	Please provide a point of contact within your organization who is most knowledgeable regarding this information.





PLEASE NOTE:
The information being requested is for planning purposes. The government does not intend to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information requested.  TTB will assess the ability of the market to meet the needs as stated above, based on the information received. The vendor must identify their business size classification (i.e. 8(a), SDVOSB, HUBZone), DUNS number, as well as provide any available contract vehicles, such as GSA Schedule.  Dependent upon the results of this market survey, TTB may subsequently issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) to acquire Mainstream Smoke pH Testing. Information sent in hard copy form, in response to this request, shall be addressed to Mindy Wargowsky, Bureau of the Public Debt, Division of Procurement, 200 Third Street-Avery 5F, Parkersburg, WV  26106.  Electronic submissions shall be sent to psb3@bpd.treas.gov, referencing ?RFI for Smoke Testing? in the subject line.  Either the hard copy or electronic submission must be received no later than 8:00 AM EST, on Tuesday, June 26, 2007.

<SUBJECT>37 -- Solicitation of interest involving testing of technologies for reducing the spray drift of pesticides
<DESC>EPA is seeking vendors of technology for reducing pesticide spray drift (drift reduction technology or DRT) to participate in a pilot project to validate a protocol for testing the effectiveness of DRT.  Specifically EPA is seeking drift-reduction application equipment or drift-reduction adjuvant chemicals that can be used with ground-boom or aerial equipment for spraying pesticides onto row or field crops and that can be tested in a low- or high-speed wind tunnel.   After the test protocols have been validated, manufacturers of DRT will have the opportunity to participate in an industry-funded Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) program conducted in partnership with EPA.  The purpose of this program is to verify the risk-reduction potential of the tested technologies.  EPA included DRT in the ETV program because DRT has the potential to reduce pesticide risks to humans and the environment by reducing pesticide exposure to non-target organisms.  A description of this program is available on EPA's website at http://www.epa.gov/etv/este/600etv06036.pdf.  

EPA drafted a test protocol for evaluating DRT and, consistent with ETV policy, shared it with a stakeholder technical panel (STP) for review and comment.  The protocol is available from Mike Koksusko (see contact information below.  

EPA will select 2-3 ground application technologies for validating the protocol for the low-speed wind tunnel test and 2-3 aerial application technologies for validating the protocol for the high speed wind tunnel test.  If more than 4 candidate technologies are offered for testing, EPA will select test candidates on the basis of the following criteria:
1)	Expectation of effectiveness, as shown by data or scientific principles;
2)	Likelihood of consumer acceptance based on ease of use or cost;
3)	Likely magnitude of use based on its possible use on major crops or possible market penetration.  
Although these numbers are small, they are sufficient to validate the protocol.   

EPA will select vendors within 30 days of the response date for this notice.  EPA will notify any vendors not selected for this pilot project of opportunities to verify their DRT in the ETV program.  

EPA expects to conduct protocol validation for about one month, beginning in the early fall and will release the final protocol in early 2008.  When EPA issues its report of this pilot project, it will identify the technologies used to validate the test protocol.

<OFFADD>Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Mountain Region Acquisition Division, 325 Broadway - MC3, Boulder, CO, 80305-3328, UNITED STATES
<SUBJECT>C -- Architectural and Engineering Services
<DESC>It is the intent of the U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA Acquisition & Grants Office, to negotiate on a sole source basis with Henningson, Durham and Richardson (HDR), 8404 Indian Hills Drive, Omaha, Nebraska, for award of a contract to provide Architect and Engineering Services.  The contract will consist of a 24-month base period, 24-month Option Period I, and 12-month Option Period II.  The contract will primarily provide for modification and update of the original A-E design accomplished by HDR for construction of a highly sophisticated research facility comprised of clean rooms and instrument laboratories and related infrastructure on the NIST Boulder Site in Boulder, CO.  The NAICS code applicable to this project is 541310, Architectural Services.  

The project schedule is extremely compressed due to the scheduled appropriation of funds by Congress to NIST for this effort.  Funds for the design modifications have been released and must be expended in FY07.  The specifications for the laboratory must be finalized in sufficient time to enable completion of a formal source selection and award of the first phase of the construction contract in FY08.  Any failure to accomplish these actions will seriously jeopardize continuation of this project of high importance to NIST research programs.

The Contractor will provide professional services to perform the full range of A/E design and post-award tasks that may include any of the following:  (A) Project Planning and Compliance Services:  (1) Research and (2) Inventory; (B) Pre-Design Services:  (1) Programming, (2) Site Analysis, and (3) Supplementary Services; (C) Design Services:  (1) Schematic Design, (2) Value Analysis Job Plan, (3) Design Development, (4) Construction Documents, (5) Construction Support, and (6) and Post Construction Award Services.   Types of tasks required may include new facility assessment studies; commercial and R&D building design and additions updates; utilities; civil and site development projects; and commercial R&D renovations.  The required disciplines for projects may include but are not limited to, the following: 

?	Architectural Planning and Design
?	Mechanical Electrical Plumbing Engineering
?	Structural Engineering
?	Civil Engineering, Survey, Land Planning and Landscape Architecture, Environmental Engineering/Sciences, Hydrology, Cultural Resources, GIS, Hazardous Materials Abatement
?	Landscape Architecture, Historic Landscape Architecture, Landscape History
?	Architectural Conservation, Archaeology, Anthropology and History
?	Geotechnical Engineering
?	Cost Estimating
?	Sustainable Technologies

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to negotiate and award with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302- 1.  This is a logical follow-on to the contract for the A-E design of the facility, since HDR is the Architect of Record for the original design.  Additional Post-Contract Award Services (PCAS) associated with construction of the laboratory are also required to be provided throughout the construction period.  These include responding to RFIs, reviewing submittals, reviewing substitution requests, redesign due to unforeseen conditions or funding limitations, claims processing, preparing specification changes for change orders, etc.     
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, firms that believe they can provide these services, without any detrimental impact to the program schedules or the clear legal rights of the Government related to design deficiencies, may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<SUBJECT>D -- Monk and McBend Software License and Support Agreement
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC ) intends to negotiate a sole-source contract with NuVision Engineering, Inc. (formerly AEA Technology Engineering Services, Inc.), herein referred to as NuVision, for a procurement entitled ?MONK AND MCBEND SOFTWARE LICENSE AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT.?  The proposed effort will require the contractor to provide the NRC with continued software support and license agreement for MONK and MCBEND codes.  The MONK criticality code and MCBEND shielding code (MONK and MCBEND) uniquely meet the NRC?s near-term needs for independent analysis tools in that they differ significantly from comparable U.S. codes and utilize nuclear data libraries derived from different evaluated data files and are processed by different codes.  Both of these proprietary codes are well documented, tested, and supported.  They also have user interfaces that allow rapid development and checking of input models.  The codes also provide unique output features that facilitate comparison of the computed neutronics and radiation physics characteristics of the systems in question to those of the experimental benchmarks used in validating the codes, modeling methods, and data libraries.  These and other code features, such as quasi-pointwise representation of the resolved energy domain and a profitability table treatment of important unresolved resonances, meet NRC staff requirements for performing fully independent and credible safety analyses with a reasonable allotment of time and resources.  There are presently no other known sources of codes that fully meet the NRC staff near-term needs for performing independent criticality and shielding calculations.  The authority for negotiating on a sole-source basis with NuVision is found under 41 U.S.C 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, which provides for limiting competition in those situations where the services are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy NRC?s requirement.  The proposed period of performance is one (1) year from the date of award, with the option to extend the period of performance for four (4) additional one (1) year periods.  The NAICS code is 511210.  The size standard for this requirement is $23 million.  This notice is not a request for proposal.  A determination not to compete this requirement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any response must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  In doing so, interested parties must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRC?s needs to Jaye Seay, Contract Specialist, Mail Stop T-7-I-2, or email JXS7@NRC.GOV no later than July 9, 2007.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

<SUBJECT>D -- U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to issue a Synopsis of Planned Contract Action and Request for Information (RFI)
<DESC>The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will proceed with its plans to replace the agency's accounting systems and procurement system with a single integrated solution by issuing a synopsis of OPM's planned contract action and Request for Information (RFI) in July 2007 and by conducting a public/private competition in the September-November 2007 timeframe.  OPM anticipates completing vendor evaluations and selection by summer of 2008 and initial implementation by October 2009. 

Pursuant to the May 22, 2006 Memorandum from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) entitled, 'Competition Framework for Financial Management Lines of Business Migration' and applicable provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), OPM intends to award the resultant contract/Interagency Agreement based on a competition amongst otherwise eligible public and/or private entities offering products and services on the GSA Schedule 70.  

The competition will result in the selection of a private vendor or public sector Shared Service Provider (SSP) with demonstrated experience to leverage Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) certified commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technology, expertise, and other resources to achieve the best value for OPM and the taxpayer.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Air Cargo - Certified Shipper 3rd Party Validation
<DESC>CERTIFIED SHIPPER PROGRAM

Responses due:  July 05, 2007 no later then 4:00pm US Eastern Time
1.0	REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
1.1	RFI Objectives

The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to assist the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in gathering information from Industry regarding resource capabilities and methodologies that exist for performing on site air cargo supply chain security certifications, validations, inspections, and/or audit services.  This RFI is issued solely for market research, planning and information purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited hereunder.
1.2	Information Being Requested
The government is contemplating the use of third party organizations to perform on site validations of shipper facilities to validate compliance with TSA security standards for facilities, procedures and personnel.  TSA is requesting that organizations that are potential third party validators or have knowledge of related business practices respond to this RFI.
1.3	Executive Summary 
TSA, in support of the Department of Homeland Security Strategic Plan, continues to implement a layered approach to cargo security throughout the air cargo supply chain.  To achieve this layered approach without disrupting the flow of commerce, TSA considers it critical for trusted industry partners throughout the air cargo supply chain to share security responsibility for cargo transported by commercial air carriers.  To strengthen this layered approach to air cargo security, TSA is considering a new initiative within the TSA's air cargo program.  
This initiative utilizes a facility-based validation process to confirm the shipper's facility adheres to published security standards developed by the TSA.  Successful validation qualifies the shipper facility to be designated TSA certified.  This TSA certification, a Certified Shipper, extends and enhances air cargo security by initiating security processes and procedures at the point of cargo origin. 
To perform the shipper validations contemplated in this initiative, TSA would accredit and utilize third party validators that would conduct onsite validations of a shipper and its facilities.  These third party validators would have to be competent in validating at least, but not limited to, the following areas:
1.	Physical Access Control
2.	Personnel Security
3.	Procedural Security
4.	Security Training and Threat Awareness
5.	Physical Security
6.	Storage and Inventory 
7.	Information Security
The third party validators would provide an objective and comprehensive validation of each shipper and its facility.  These third party validators would document this validation process and report the results of each validation to TSA.  This validation documentation would be critical information used by TSA to then determine whether or not a shipper's personnel, process, and technologies at a given facility meet TSA standards.  The validation process would result in TSA either certifying or rejecting the company as a certified shipper.  The decision to certify a shipper as part of the TSA air cargo shipper program would remain solely within the discretion of TSA.  
1.4	Detail of this RFI
Information requested:  
(1)  Describe the capabilities that the organization possesses in conducting a range of inspection, validation, and/or audit services for security standards in the cargo supply chain in today's market.  
(2)  Describe the skills, competencies, industry accreditation(s) and training of the organization's workforce employees to perform these services.
(3)  Describe the expertise or knowledge the organization possesses in standard security practices within the air cargo supply training.
(4)  State the geographic location(s) of the organization.  Describe the locations or regions within the United States and location outside the United States that the organization currently deploys staff, and locations that the organization could deploy, for this type of service.  
(5)  Describe the type of inspection, validation, and/or audit reporting system or mechanism that the organization supports.  
(6)  Describe the organization's business practices that would ensure standardization and consistency in performing inspections, certifications, validations and/or audits.  
(7)  Provide examples of the organization's current or proposed fee structure and the fee range(s) associated with performing inspection, validation, and/or audit services of the nature described in this RFI and/or for work currently being conducted.
(8) Describe the type of background check and security clearance required of the organization's workforce.

<SUBJECT>--NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE ARMY FACILITIES COMPONENT SYSTEMS (AFCS)DESIGN & MAINTENANCE SUPPORT SERVICES
<DESC>Authority Cited:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. The Army Corp of Engineers Huntsville Support Center (HNC) intends to make a sole source award to a small business, Casa Designs LLC, 461 Capshaw Road Suite D, Madison, AL 35757 Description of Supplies/Services: The objective of this contract is to procure follow-on non commercial highly specialized services from one source utilizing other than full and open competition to provide continued technical, maintenance and design suppor t of the AFCS database in accordance with Army Regulation 415-16 and related guidance.  The AFCS Branch must perform studies and develop austere contingency designs and support data.  AFCS designs are reviewed and updated to utilize unique state-of-the-art technology in contingency construction designs, materials, and techniques within Army t ransformation to conserve resources. The AFCS database enables users to adapt required building materials to local climates.  The AFCS design library contains simple and standard temporary facility designs that require minimum engineer support to be assemb led. These designs allow non-engineer troops or indigenous laborers to perform the majority of the work which enables the engineer to oversee multiple projects simultaneously.   The unique and highly specialized services provide support to the global war on terrorism (GWOT), disaster relief, and contingency theater operations.  Services to be provided include: (1) The development, conversion, and revision of drawings, bill of mate rials (BOM), Labor and Equipment Estimates (LEE), construction schedules and construction process management estimates for a variety of facilities and installations in Army contingency operations; (2) Incorporation of drawings, bill of materials (BOM), Lab or and Equipment Estimates (LEE) and construction process management estimates into the AFCS database; (3) Revision and maintenance of AFCS standards technical manual; (4)  Analysis of Theater of Operations (TO) Army Construction and facility requirements and preparation of criteria and plans for updating AFCS, AFCS designs and TOGS to satisfy those requirements and (5) Preparation of AFCS and AFCS drawings using Computer-Aided Design techniques and provision of digitized drawing in AFCS input format and re lated tasks to support the AFCS maintenance and design mission.  These services are critical to the GWOT and contingency mission.  As such, the contractor must have the ability to perform the required services at the time of award.  AFCS is a contingency p rogram.  Therefore, any delay or lapse of such services will have grave results on the warfighter and prove detrimental to the overall mission of the Army. The Contracting Officer anticipates the award of a small business set-aside, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) utilizing firm fixed price (FFP) and labor hours (LH) contract types.  Services for this award are applicable under NAICS code 54151 2. The period of performance for the requirement is one base year and (4) four one year option periods. The estimated value of the anticipated IDIQ is $9.8 million.   Respondents shall submit information to the Contracting Officer on official company letterhead detailing clear and convincing evidence of their technical expertise and how an award to any other source would meet the highly unique and specialized requiremen ts of the HNC AFCS contingency mission.  Submissions shall include affirmation of an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR), Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number or cage code and business size. The Contracting Officer will consider all correspo ndence received in response to this notice. Not withstanding the reference in numbered note 22, to a 45 day response.  The intent is to issue a sole source solicitation within (15) fifteen days of the publication of thi s notice, unless a basis for competition exists.   *Reference Numbered Note 22 Any responses to this notice shall be furnished electronically by 4:00 P.M.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  No additional notification will be issued by the FCC.  ALL COMMUNICATIONS IN REFERENCE TO THESE OPPORTUNITIES SHALL BE THROUGH USAC'S Contracting Office.  The RFP describes the services requested and provides instructions on how to respond. --- BACKGROUND: USAC is a not-for-profit Delaware corporation.

The purpose of this RFP is to invite the submission of offers from independent accounting firms to perform an external peer review of USAC's Internal Audit Division in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is W912HQ-07-T-0003, which is a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation inicorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Ci rcular 05-16. NAICS Code 541690. The period of performance is six(6) months from date of award. The following FAR provisions apply FAR 52.212-1, 52.212-4, 52-212-5, 52.222-26, 52.232-33, and 252.243-7001.  Purchase\Acquisition of Professional Consultant Se rvices to Provide Training & Technical Support for the REMI (Regional Economic Models, Inc.) System for Evaluation of Economic Impacts Attributable to Storm-Induced Catastrophic Circumstance (as required for specifications of the Louisiana Coastal Restorat ion and Protection Study [LACPR]) Scope of Work or Service(s) & Requirement(s) Introduction\Background During the course of calendar year 2006, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) was directed to participate in a multi-agency effort (the Interagency Performance Evaluation Task Force or IPET) to investigate and analyze the catastrophic impacts of Hurric ane Katrina on the New Orleans metropolitan area.  Part of this effort involved the evaluation of direct, indirect, and induced economic impacts.  A review of available economic impact models was conducted and it was determined that due to the severity and  significance of impacts induced by Katrina, one readily-available model was best suited to evaluations needed for studies.  The economic impact model selected and applied for IPET studies was the modeling system developed by Regional Economic Models, Inco rporated (REMI).  The REMI system was licensed for IPET studies for a period of six (6) months, a sufficient period of time to complete studies for IPET and to evaluate whether the model was\is analytically sound and appropriate for further studies of cata strophic conditions.  Post review of the REMI system indicates that it remains the only readily-available impact model reasonably applicable to catastrophic impacts sufficiently severe to result in significant restructuring of a regional economy. Due to the nature and scope of catastrophic impact evaluations for LACPR studies, it has been determined that the REMI model system should be purchased or licensed via sole source for application to LACPR studies.  Additional justification for sole-source acquisition of the REMI system is based on the critical need to build on lessons learned and findings and methods developed during the course of IPET studies, and for efforts to maintain continuity, comparability and consistency of analytical technique and  procedures to analytical approach applied to LACPR studies. Due to foreseeable ongoing or future need to apply the REMI system for a variety of scenarios with an extended study horizon under LACPR studies, the most practical course for studies is to orient and train in-house staff of the Corps and New Orleans Distr ict to apply the modeling system.  As with requirements for IPET, the application of the REMI system will require thorough and comprehensive knowledge of the modeling system and its use including experience with parameters for compiling and massaging input  data, understanding of the underlying assumptions and computational algorithms, and experience in the interpretation of output.  The most practical and cost-effective way to bring staff to proficiency in use of the system is secure professional services a lready skilled in its use to provide professional training and technical oversight of modeling system operation until District or Corps staff assigned to LACPR studies are sufficiently knowledgeable and proficient to independently apply the REM I system to studies needed for LACPR efforts.  Because LACPR studies largely represent an extension or continuation of impact studies and evaluations initiated under IPET and the studies conducted for IPET were\are considered unique in nature of application for the REMI system, it is recommended that t raining and support services be conducted by an individual or individuals familiar with impact studies as conducted for IPET.  Inquiry as to the disposition or availability of within-government or in-house labor considered proficient in the application of the REMI system indicates that due to schedules and demands on time associated with other work efforts, professional services and support will need to be obtained via private-sector contract from outside the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).   Deliverables and Period of Performance (for the Vendor): The deliverables required for training and support under the contract shall include the following items with the overall objective to train District personnel to independently operate and support use of the REMI modeling system for LACPR studies: 1.) Development and submission of a written outline for training and instruction concerning: a. The critical methods, algorithms, and assumptions of the REMI modeling system (including a general orientation of how the REMI system compares to other common readily-available or off-the-shelf economic impact models such as RIMS II or IMPLAN) b. Adapatation or calibration of the model to catastrophic circumstance c. The evaluation and adjustment or calibration of needed data d. Operation\execution of the model e. Interpretation of findings or output f.	Execution of applicable basic test\example for operation of the model       2.)  Personal administration of one initial on-site training session in New Orleans covering content described or as required for the written outline above (duration of  approximately four (4) full man-days including allowances for travel).        3.)   Personal administration of a second on-site training session in New Orleans to discuss and review input data issues or resolve technical problems and conduct review of output; make recommendations concerning secondary model calibration or adjus tment or use of additional data. (duration of  approximately four (4) full man-days including allowances for travel).       4.)  Option for a a third on-site training session or meeting to bring closure to technical issues, discussion of advanced model adaptation and review\interpretation of output for studies as generated by District staff  (duration of  up to approximat ely four (4) full man-days including allowances for travel).   At the end of each meeting the contractor will submit a summary written memorandum for record as to objectives accomplished and issues resolved or pending resolution.  Given the description of requirements, the total calendar time period of performance for  technical work and model support of training and technical support for REMI relative to LACPR studies is estimated at no more than six (6) months from date of award.  Contact information for will be given at time of award.
