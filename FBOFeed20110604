Length of service<br>includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br>successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br>performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)<br><br>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br>King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br>Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A<br>contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br>accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)<br><br><br><br>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:<br><br>1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br>not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br>administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because<br>most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br>not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br>week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br>400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br>within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not<br>list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br>data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br>$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For<br>example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br>within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br>occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br>then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br>conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br>determination.<br><br>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br>industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br>professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br>who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br>    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br>consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br>specifications;<br>    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br>modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br>related to user or system design specifications;<br>    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br>programs related to machine operating systems; or<br>    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br>requires the same level of skills.

The Kennedy, (ex VELMA LYKES) currently employs a General Regulator N-51 parallel positioning Combustion Control system for its two propulsion boilers. This system is inherently inefficient in that the fuel oil always leads the air. In addition, the system is a 1951 design requiring parts which are no longer supportable. It is our desire to replace the N-51 with an automated&nbsp;system of proven reliability and supportability which will result in maximum combustion efficiency. It is the purpose of this RFP to identify the company, system and equipment that can best accomplish this work in a cost effective and beneficial manner.<br /><br />The complete solicitation package,&nbsp;DTMA-92-P-2011-0004, will be available at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about 05/23/2011.&nbsp; This requirement is Total Set-Aside for Small Businesses under the NAICS Code 336611.&nbsp; A firm fixed price contract is contemplated.&nbsp; Please note that all firms conducting business with MARAD must be registered with the Government Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of any contract.&nbsp; You can register at www site <a href="http://www.ccr.gov">http://www.ccr.gov</a>.<br /><br />The successful offeror shall be responsible for designing, obtaining regulatory approval, installing and testing as part of a sea trial the new system. The new system must provide, at all boiler loads, fully automated control (to include a means of manual backup control) of fuel, air, feed water and burner management to the boilers. It shall be designed as a fully metered system ensuring that air/fuel ratios remain in their optimum and safe ranges. The new system shall be of cross limited control ensuring that air leads fuel with increasing steam demand and lags with decreasing demand. In addition, the new system shall employ oxygen trim ensuring proper air/fuel ratios with varying fuel qualities and air flow conditions. The new system shall employ fully automatic, 3 element feed water control.<br />All offerors proposals shall include a detailed description on how they will manage/control the below functions, these items will be evaluated as individual items and as part of a complete boiler automation system.<br />
<ul class="unIndentedList">
<li>COMBUSTION CONTROL AND FEEDWATER CONTROL</li>
<li>FEED PUMP CONTROL</li>
<li>F.O. TEMPERATURE CONTROL</li>

<li>MAIN CONDENSER HOTWELL LEVEL CONTROL</li>

<li>BURNER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</li>
</ul>
It is currently planned to award a firm fixed-price contract to the "best value" offeror by early July 2011 so that design and approval of the proposed system can be obtained prior to installation aboard the TS KENNEDY beginning on or after September 6, 2011.&nbsp; Installation work, to be completed by November 1, 2011, will be followed by a sea trial to test the new system in early November.<br /><br />ATTENTION: Minority, Women-owned, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs)!
