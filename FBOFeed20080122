<DESC>CDC, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has a requirement for The Development of Sustainable Human Performance. 

Background and Need
In 2006, disasters at the Sago, Darby, and Alma Mines made the year the deadliest for mine workers in recent memory.  In response to these and other accidents, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (the MINER Act).  This Act requires the National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH) to undertake new work, and it required the establishment of a permanent Office of Mine Safety and Health.  The passage of this Act is causing a major change in the organization of the Mining Program staff as well as a change in the research program being carried out.  This requires a review of the current research and an assessment of gaps in the current research program as well as current capabilities to accomplish this new mission.   In addition, the leadership of the Mining Program has undergone a change with the appointment of a permanent Director at the Spokane Research Laboratory (SRL).  

The new demands of the MINER Act have required a level of performance that is not sustainable for the long term.  Assistance is required for the Mining Program to develop a program for sustainable performance.  Assistance is also required for the new SRL Director.  The new Director needs to become integrated into the existing management team, and at the same time, develop a plan to transform the SRL to be responsive to the new requirements of the MINER Act and to be flexible in response if the ?MINER Act II? that is currently proposed in Congress is passed.  The contractor providing assistance must have experience and a clear understanding of the mining industry and the unique challenges that it presents for research and development.  The contractor must also have experience in developing and implementing leadership programs in government R&D organizations.

Project Objectives
The contractor will work with the leadership of the NIOSH Office of Mine Safety & Health to develop a program for long-term sustainable performance.  This will enable the Office of Mine Safety & Health to be more effective in response to the MINER Act, and ultimately, to provide the research and prevention efforts to help eliminate fatalities, injuries, and illnesses for America?s mine workers.

Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities are encouraged to submit their inquiries to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice.  Please forward information to Margaret L. Mooney, reference number 2008-Q-10283, CDC, NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA  15236, mmooney@cdc.gov.  All vendors must be registered at www.ccr.gov.

Requests for quotations (RFQ) 2008-Q-10283 will be issued electronically on or after February 7, 2008.  The entire scope of work and technical evaluation factors will be addressed in the solicitation when posted.  This procurement will be awarded as a fixed price purchase order; reference simplified acquisition procedures, FAR Part 13.

<SUBJECT>N -- NATO Notification of Intent to Invite Bids for International Competitive Bidding to Upgrade/Replace NATO Static Satellite Ground Terminals
<SOLNBR>IFB-CO-12343-SGS
<RESPDATE>021308
<ARCHDATE>02202008
<CONTACT>Lee Ann Carpenter, Trade and Industry Analyst, Phone 202-482-2583, Fax 202-482-5650, Email Lcarpent@bis.doc.gov - John Isbell, Program Manager-NATO, Phone 202-482-8229, Fax 202-482-5650, Email jisbell@bis.doc.gov
<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the upgrade and replacement of NATO Satellite Ground Terminals (SGTs). 

NATO has identified a requirement to upgrade its static satellite communications anchor facilities in order to better support ongoing and future missions and to significantly reduce operating costs. The overall capability sought will be achieved through consolidating anchor capacity at a small number of sites. These sites will be designed and constructed to operate efficiently across a broad range of traffic conditions and under a variety of operational environments. High levels of availability, supportability, and maintainability are required throughout the expected system life.

The project will establish two new multi-antenna Satellite Ground Stations (SGSs) on the sites of existing NATO SGTs in Belgium and Italy and upgrade two of the existing SGTs in Greece and Turkey.  A comprehensive overarching management capability will provide the means for staff in the NATO Network Control Centers to control and monitor all operationally relevant elements at the sites, thus facilitating further reductions in manning at the anchor sites. The combination of the SGSs, the upgraded SGTs and their associated management capability will be collectively referred to as the NATO SATCOM Anchor Component.

The project to be presented in the Invitation for Bids (IFB) will lead to the creation of a basic contract for immediate implementation, with options for additional procurement of more of the same type of systems and for contractor logistics support services.

NC3A is serving as the contracting agency for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. NC3A intends to use Best Value Procedure, in which both price and technical criteria are assessed in order to rank the submitted bids. The successful bid pursuant to this IFB will be that bid that provides the best value for the money applying evaluation criteria of 50% price and 50% technical.

The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-12343-SGS. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.

Bidders will be required to declare a bid validity of 12 months from the closing date for the receipt of bids, supported by a bid guarantee of Euro 100,000 ($146,000). Should the selection and award procedure extend beyond 12 months after the bid closing date, firms will be requested to extend the validity of their bids and bid guarantee accordingly.  Bidders may decline to do so, withdraw their bid and excuse themselves from the bidding process without penalty.

The IFB package, including the functional and technical performance specifications applicable to the bidding and the contractual documents, has a security classification of NATO UNCLASSIFIED, with the exception of the security-related requirements, which will be provided in annexes with a NATO RESTRICTED classification.  Bidders will be required to submit any bid response material classified higher than NATO RESTRICTED through the U.S. Mission to NATO.

The successful contractor will be required to handle and store classified information up to the level of NATO SECRET and only companies maintaining the appropriate facility clearance will be eligible to bid on this project. In addition, contractor personnel visiting or working on operational NATO sites will be required to hold individual security clearances of at least NATO SECRET. Bidders will be given the opportunity to visit all of the operations sites covered by the project and to attend a bidders conference; bidders representatives for these events will also be required to hold at minimum a NATO SECRET clearance. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the NATO contracting agency the NATO clearance certifications.

Bidders will be required to quote for the provision of the subject capability to include hardware, software, documentation, testing, on-site training and transition on-site support. Warranties will also be included for maintenance and support of the systems. Fixed price quotations will be required covering the total of the contract line items including optional contractor logistics support services. The bidders will also be required to quote for further optional elements covering supply, installation, and integration of additional quantities of the same equipment.

Bidders will be required to optimize their solutions considering efficiency, maintainability and supportability aspects in addition to performance, cost and schedule factors. The purchaser will evaluate bids received using best value procedures in which both price and technical criteria are assessed to determine the best overall solution. The price element will encompass both investment and CLS prices. The technical element will consider the quality of the engineering solution; supportability, including maintainability and efficiency aspects; overall project management, including the prospective supplier quality, experience and competence to undertake the work; and, finally, the bidders approach to managing risks within the project.

The solicitation will require the that bidders guarantee that the radio frequencies specified are compatible with the regulations and controls of the nations and that national frequency clearances will be obtained as appropriate. 

Bidders shall consider that the IFB encompasses infrastructural civil works on two of the sites, for which the contractor will need to employ civil work subcontractors familiar with civil works for large electronics installations and based in the nations where the civil works are to be performed in order to facilitate full compliance with local legislative and inspection requirements.

The solicitation will include a requirement for prospective bidders to demonstrate their ability to undertake this project and to demonstrate that they have experience with the provision of a similar type of system.

GENERAL PROJECT OVERVIEW

The extent of work required varies site by site but, broadly, the appointed contractor will be responsible for the following:

- Providing a detailed design covering all aspects of the anchor capability

- Meeting all of the regulatory, safety, environmental and any other prudent codes

- Preparing the sites including removal of any material that is not relevant to providing the required capability and restoring the land and surrounding to a suitable natural state on completion

- Building the system, providing all necessary equipment with the exception of specified items provided by the purchaser and accomplishing the work on schedule. This includes conforming to best practices of workmanship, quality, appearance and safety.

- Developing and subsequently successfully executing a test program in order to confirm the performance of each important subsystem and to demonstrate that NATO requirements are fully met

- Providing initial on-site training courses at the SGSs and developing formal training courses, including provision and installation of suitable training simulators, for subsequent delivery by the NATO CIS School in Latina, Italy

- Optionally, providing a range of contractor logistics support services for a period of up to 20 years for the SGS sites and up to 10 years for the upgraded SGT sites.

Reminder: All contractor personnel having access to NATO classified information or working at operational NATO sites will be required to hold individual security clearances of NATO SECRET.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

Modems

Electronic Protection Measures (EPM) modems, provided to the contractor as Purchaser Furnished Equipment (PFE), will be installed under separate project arrangement at two sites (F13 and F14); these are to be integrated into the contractor solution. The contractor will also be required to install and integrate further quantities of these modems at all Anchor Component sites, with the equipment necessary being similarly provided as PFE.

The contractor will be required to select, supply and install new bandwidth-efficient FDMA modems at all Anchor Component sites. The new bandwidth efficient modems will also be capable of providing communications service in modes that are compatible with legacy FDMA modems.

The contractor will be required to provide interfaces suitable for the purchaser to install and operate additional unspecified modems as required to support specific users and to develop new military SATCOM services.

Control and Monitoring

The Advanced SATCOM Network Monitoring and Control (ASNMC) will be used, initially, to effect power control of the SGTs and of NATO Transportable SGTs; future enhancement planned for ASNMC include a spectrum monitoring capability. An initial ASNMC equipment fit will be installed at two sites under separate project arrangements, expected to be F13 and F14 but subject to confirmation; these installations are to be integrated into the contractor solution in order to facilitate power control of all links serviced by the upgraded Anchor Component. The contractor will also be required to install and integrate further quantities of ASNMC equipment at all Anchor Component sites, with the equipment necessary being similarly provided as PFE. In addition, the contractor will be required to provide a centralized facility, at all anchor sites, for monitoring and, as necessary, control of all operationally relevant elements. This facility is to be extended to NATO Network Control Centers such that a similar range of elements can be monitored and a defined range of control functions can be executed.

SGS Site Infrastructure

Although the current project is essentially confined to providing X-band solutions, the establishment of NATO SGSs is seen as the first step in creating a broader NATO Teleport facility.  Thus, the contractor will be required to use the available land at the SGSs efficiently and to ensure that the facilities are designed and constructed in a way that will facilitate such future expansion and enhancements.

Antennas: The SGS sites are to be equipped with as many as 5 X-band low PIM antennas. Broadly, larger antennas will be required to provide robust services in the most demanding environments supplemented by smaller antennas for use at low-to-medium traffic levels and in unstressed environments. Antennas will be equipped with a suitable range of transmitters to variously deliver services efficiently and to accommodate stress.

Physical Security: The contractor will be required to provide and upgrade as necessary a full range of robust physical security measures at the SGS sites. This will include perimeter fences, access controls, perimeter lighting and site surveillance sytems.

Civil Works Participation: In order to facilitate full compliance with local legislative and inspection requirements for civil works in Belgium and Italy, the contractor will be required to employ an architectural and engineering subcontractor and a civil works subcontractor familiar with designing and constructing large electronics installations and respectively accredited in each country to perform the required range of work.

F1 Kester: The Kester site is situated to the west of the village of Kester, about 25 km west of the Brussels ring road. At the Belgian SGS, the contractor must furnish all that is necessary to transform the existing site by demolishing and subsequently replacing the existing terminal, site buildings and facilities, including physical security elements and contingency power facilities.

F14 Lughezzano: The Lughezzano site is about 520 meters above sea level at the end of a south-facing valley, north of Verona. For the capability required at the Italian site, the successful bidder will retain the existing antenna and the principal site structures, but must provide everything else needed. This includes limited refurbishment of the legacy antenna, radome replacement and extensive upgrades to the contingency power facilities at the site.

SGT Upgrade Work

Upgrades at the NATO SGTs will be focused on achieving operational efficiencies and life extensions. The refurbishments sought will improve reliability and compatibility with the SGSs and extend their life for another 10 years. Although there are some layout, configuration and equipment differences between the two sites, a broadly similar range of work is envisaged at both sites. The existing legacy antenna will be retained at both sites and some limited refurbishment will be required. In addition, specific items identified for upgrade include changing the transmitter for an efficient, reliable and supportable alternative, compatible with what is selected for the SGSs, replacing the existing radomes, and upgrading the site contingency power facilities.

NATO SGT F11 is situated near Atalanti in Greece on a site overlooking the Evian Gulf. Nato SGT F13 is situated in Oglananasi, nears Izmir in Turkey in the vicinity of the new Izmir civil airport. Both sites are in rural areas but are served by generally good access roads.

Warranty

It is envisaged that upgrades will be introduced and commissioned progressively leading to final acceptance based around a full system test of remote operational capabilities. Warranty support will be required at each of the sites covering the period from the provisional site acceptance to full system acceptance. A full system warranty will then be required for a period of one year from full system acceptance.

Site Visits

The purchaser will provide an opportunity for bidders to visit each of the Anchor Component sites and the NATO CIS School. These visits will be scheduled soon after the IFB package is issued. A full bidders conference will be scheduled shortly thereafter providing opportunities to clarify bidding requirements as necessary and to respond to any issues raised during site surveys. Bidders representatives for all of these events will be required to hold at least a NATO SECRET security clearance.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for this procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB). The U.S. Department of Commerce is authorized to approve for participation in NATO ICB those firms with a facility located within the United States. Once approved, the firm will be nominated to the bidders list. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to participate in NATO ICB:

<SOLNBR>N0038305G043N
<CONTACT>Kathleen Northup 215-697-1380
<DESC>Subject synopsis is to cover requirements for the H-46 Spares - Basic Ordering Agreement(BOA)thru 16 December 2008, with The Boeing Helicopter Company (77272). The subject items on the BOA require engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the items. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source require acquisition of the items from the approved source. The approved source retains data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the parts. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended appl!  ication. The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the government for these items will  be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the "https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm" Naval Inventory Control Point Philadelphia Source Approval Information Brochure. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar items, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy o!  f the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. O ffers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for an award. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVICP Commercial Item Identification Brochure is available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm".

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division, Panama City, FL (NSWC-PCD) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to the Parvus Corporation, 3222 S. Washington St., Salt Lake City, UT 84115.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC-PC) has a requirement for four (4) each DuraNET 2955 Ruggedized Cisco 2955 Catalyst Switches and two (2) each MIL-C-38999 to RJ-45 and DB-9 connectors? starter cable sets.  The equipment being procured was specifically designed for use in the Remote Mine hunting System (RMS) Multiple Vehicle Communication System (MVCS).  The items being procured are only available from Parvus for the following reasons.  Parvus has already developed and tested the commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) equivalent Cisco unit that we are currently using for testing.  Development time for another vendor to ruggedize this component would take six to nine months which would have a negative impact on the MVCS project schedule.  In addition, this wo!  uld result in increased cost for another vendor to develop an equivalent unit.  This unit was selected because it conformed to the Navy?s size/weight/heat restrictions.  Selecting Parvus? ?off the shelf? design will insure that the components arrive on time and will not delay the integration of MVCS and a program of record aboard the Littoral Combat Ship.  Altering this device selection would affect any current development, which would adversely affect ship delivery.  Drawings have already been provided to facilitate a smoother integration with the MVCS hardware.  This item represents the minimum capabilities required to meet the scope of the project and best mimics the COTS functionality.  Use of another company?s equipment may introduce new or change existing parameters that may do more harm than good to existing equipment. The Request for Quote (RFQ) number is N61331-08-T-3507.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures is the method of award for this procurement.  The NAICS code is 334419 with size standard of 500 employees.  The order shall be firm fixed priced.  The expected award date is 6 February 2008.  Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7001.  Delivery terms for this requirement are FOB Destination.  A number note of 22 applies to this requirement. In order to be eligible for award firms must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Vendors may obtain information on registration in the CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Please note that defense payment office may not make payment unless the contractor is established to receive electronic funds transfer (EFT).  EFT payments are based on the contractor?s EFT information contained in the CCR database.  The NSWCPC has implemented Electronic Commerce (EC) in the acquisition area.

Dobson, Procuring Contracting Officer, 12423 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826. <BR><BR>OBJECTIVE: The Severe Trauma Simulation Army Technology Objective (ATO) is researching capabilities to realistically simulate the look, feel, smell, and c linical accuracy of severe trauma for training medics, combat lifesavers and Soldiers.  Severe trauma simulations will be tied to training scenarios appropriate for the current Operational Tempo (OPTEMPO) in the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) and include a fter action review capabilities.  While many of the objectives of the Severe Trauma Simulation ATO are being met by existing contracts, RDECOM-STTC is still looking for research in the area of olfactory stimulation to support realistic training.  Specifica lly:<BR><BR>1.	Technology to deliver relevant odors into a training environment.  Note that training may occur both indoors and outdoors.  <BR>a.	For indoor use, delivered odors must not be persistent, i.e., once the training event is complete, the area sh ould be able to be rid of the delivered odors in a relatively short time period.<BR>b.	For outdoor use, the odors must be strong enough to pervade the training area, subject to atmospheric conditions, while not unnaturally overwhelming trainees and trainer s.<BR>2.	Chemicals used to create the odors must not damage clothing any surface they contact as they are delivered, including flesh, clothing, walls, floors (carpet/concrete), and vegetation.  Clothing subjected to the chemicals should be able to remove a ny lingering odor after a minimal number (preferably 1) of washings.  <BR>3.	Both ambient odors (e.g., diesel fuel, gunpowder, sweat, odors natural to the environment being simulated for training) and trauma-related odors (e.g., feces, urine, burnt flesh a nd hair, bowel) should be delivered.  Take into account the current operational environments todays Army faces when considering environmental odors.<BR>4.	Chemicals used to create the odors must be easy and safe to store for long periods of time, cannot d egrade over a period of 1 year (minimum) to 2 years (optimum).<BR>5.	Personnel preparing the chemicals for delivery must be able to do so with minimal contact.  There should be no measuring of proper amounts to use; optimally, the delivery method will take  a concentrate and perform any dilution required by the scenario. <BR>6.	As much as possible, body odors should come from the relevant source, i.e., patient simulators.  In addition, odors should be scenario controlled, e.g., a bowel odor should be deliver ed if and when a student cuts into a patient simulator bowel. <BR>7.	The primary goal is to introduce the physical and psychological barriers that all care givers must overcome before they can successfully treat severely injured soldiers.<BR><BR>The planne d method for accomplishing the research in this prospective area is to utilize a phased approach.   Therefore, White Papers submitted should be structured so that the technical approach/solution for the proposed research areas address a Basic Award (Phase I) and one (1) priced Option Effort (Phase II) as stated below.  The White Paper must include the anticipated period of performance, a technical description of the proposed concepts, the technical objectives and a planned approach to accomplish the stated objectives as well as a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost.  The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit/fee, if any.  <BR><BR>PHASE I.  The Phase I ef fort will research how technology can be brought to fulfill the  objectives as listed in the Objective paragraph, above.  Initial prototypes should be developed and demonstrated in relevant environments (i.e., both interior and exterior training environmen ts.)  <BR><BR>Phase I will be a 12-month effort and funding will be approximately $75,000-$100,000.<BR><BR>PHASE II. The Phase II effort will continue refining the prototype to improve realism, increase ruggedness, and to address any shortcomings identifie d in Phase I. <BR><BR>At this time, it is anticipated that Phase II will be a 12-month effort with funding of approximately $150,000-$200,000, subject to budgeting constraints.<BR><BR>Reference Documents are provided at http://www.rdecom.army.mil/STTC/baa. html<BR><BR>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION FOR THIS EFFORT.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  <BR><BR>WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION: <BR><BR>Any responsible offeror capable of satisfying the objectives identified in this annou ncement may submit a white paper. White Paper submissions are encouraged as early as possible but must be received at RDECOM STTC no later than 1600 EDT 31 March 2008. No extensions will be granted. White papers must address the objectives for both Phases and shall not exceed 10 pages in length of computerized text at 12-pitch, excluding resumes. Only unclassified white papers will be accepted.  All white papers must include Phase II as a priced option.  The white papers will be reviewed to determine that t he proposed effort is within the scope and interest of this solicitation.  A proposal will only be solicited from white papers deemed to best meet the program objectives. White papers will be evaluated by a technical review board using the following criter ia listed in descending order of importance:<BR>(1) Scientific and Technical Merit: Proposed efforts should create new, or apply existing technology in a new way, that is advantageous to the proposed research topic.  The overall scientific and technical me rit of the proposal must be clearly identifiable.  The technical concept should be clearly defined and developed.  Emphasis should be placed on the offeror's technical approach through a comprehensive, logical, orderly, concise, phased plan that indicates major milestones, critical paths, key events, capabilities that can be spun off, demonstration articles, etc.  Consideration should be given to the extent which current State-of-the-Art technology is expanded.    Offeror should discuss how their concept wi ll be documented, demonstrated, or evaluated, and this discussion should be indicative of the understanding of what is required in this program.  <BR>(2) Potential Contribution to Military Services Needs and Transition to other Programs: The offeror must a dequately address how the proposed solution will meet the goal of the research topic.  The proposal must show understanding of the potential approach and make a compelling case for the viability of the proposed effort.  The relevance is further indicated b y the offeror's understanding of the operating environment of the product or demonstration (current Military or Industrial technical problems/issues, limitations, etc.).  The relationships of the proposed effort with other ongoing or anticipated initiative s (military or civilian) that are focused on improving the Medical Modeling and Simulation should be considered.  Offeror should recognize and identify potential strategies for transitioning technology within the DoD.  Plans on how offeror intends to get d eveloped technology, and information on these developments, to the user community should be considered. <BR>(3) Personnel: The qualifications, experience, capab ilities, and demonstrated achievements of the proposed principal investigators and other key personnel for the primary and subcontractor organizations should be examined and assessed for the proposal objectives.<BR> (4) Corporate Capabilities and Facilitie s: Offerors are required to describe their relevant capabilities and accomplishments.  The offeror must have a demonstrated capability to conceptualize, develop theories, identify concept deficiencies, analyze, and develop mature concepts for rapid applica tion/ demonstration.  Consider the offerors history of related work.  Also consider any unique facilities or equipment that the offeror possesses.<BR> (5) Cost: The overall estimated cost to accomplish the effort should be considered as well as the substa ntiation of the costs for the technical complexity described.  Evaluation should consider the extent to which the proposed management plan will effectively allocate and provide accounting of funds, equipment, and personnel, select subprojects, monitor and evaluate the program to achieve the proposed objectives, and respond to contingencies created by unanticipated technical barriers or breakthroughs.<BR><BR>Cost reasonableness and realism will be assessed, but this assessment is of a lower priority than the  technical evaluation.   White Papers found to be consistent with the requirements of this announcement and deemed to best meet the program objectives may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  To be eligible for award a white paper must be s ubmitted. <BR><BR>Upon completion of white paper evaluations, Offerors will be notified whether or not their white paper was favorably received. Favorable review of a white paper does not constitute selection of the proposed effort for contract award and w ill not establish a binding commitment for the Government to fund the effort in whole or part. Upon notification, the Government will issue a request for proposal letter to the qualified offeror(s), who best meet the program objectives. If proposals are so licited, proposals are due NLT 2 June 2008.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice of intent, to procure commercial items prepared in accordance with the format of FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a Notice of Intent (NOI8198).  This solicitation and its incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC2005-23.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure maintenance services for the terrazzo marble floor in our BLDG. 40 facility, which is located on the National Institutes of Health campus.  This service will be required on a monthly basis.  This service is being procured on a sole source basis using Simplified Acquisition procedures, with the Stuart Dean Company.  Stuart Dean is an accredited founding member of the Marble Institute of America (MIA) and the International Association of Stone Restoration and Conservation (IASRAC).  Their processes and proprietary methods are accepted by the above, routinely out perform the competition and are of higher quality and achieve longer lasting results.  Stuart Dean is also a participatory member of the American Society of Testing Materials and is asked to test products and systems for the regulatory body.  Stuart Dean is a National Associate Member of BOMA (Building Owners and Managers Association) International.  They have provided maintenance in Bldg. 40 facility for the past 4 Years.  This is not a small business Set-Aside.  The requirement consists of monthly maintenance of the following: 1) 4,200 square feet of terrazzo marble in 1st floor public area: 2) elevator lobby; 3) steps leading to North rotunda entrance; 4) landing at base of stairs; 5) areas to be refinished will be completely masked and covered with protective paper and plastic to ensure integrity of delicate finishes adjacent to marble, such as bronze and wood; 6) all light to medium scratches will be removed using abrasive means including resin-bonded diamond pads and sand screens in conjunction with a weighted floor machine; 7) a powdered mixture of oxalic acid, aluminum oxide and water will be used as a polishing compound under a 19 natural fiber-polishing pad; 8) once even polished is achieved, all polishing slurry will be removed by use of a water vacuum, followed by a two-step neutralizing process achieved by flooding the polished area with ph balanced stone soap; 9) vitrification or crystallization of marble will be performed to improve the floors, slip co-efficient and enhance the hardness of shine, per manufacturers specifications utilizing specially low-rotation floor machine and #2 Texsteel steel wool pads.  The scope of the work is to restore the luster and sheen of the floor material by adherence to methodology developed by the Marble Institute of America and the International Association of Stone Restoration and Conservation.  Workers skilled in vitrification process are a mandatory requirement.  Depending on the extent of the wear, the requirements include polishing with abrasive compounds and vitrification of the surface.  It is critical that the thickness of the marble be minimized as the marble is ground during the polishing process.  The marble is only a fraction of an inch thick, and serious repercussions could arise regarding the longevity of the floor.  It is critical that only an experienced, high-quality firm perform this work.  The Period of Performance will be February 2008 through January 2009.  The North American Industry Classification System Code Number 238990 and the Small business Set-Aside is 12.0 million.  The FOB point shall be Destination.  This will be a firm-fixed price contract.  The following Federal Acquisition Regulations provisions and clauses apply to the acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; Far 52.212-3 Offeror Representation and Certifications Commercial Items; Far 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; Far 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items; and FAR 52.406-7 Central Contractor Registration (2003).  A completed copy of provisions at FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representation and Certifications Commercial Items must be included which can be found at Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) https://orca.bpn.gov.  (B) (1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement for conference support for a roundtable on Environmental Health Sciences, Research, and Medicine.  The Roundtable on Environmental Health Sciences, Research, and Medicine will provide a  convening mechanism for interested parties from the academic, industrial, consumer, and federal research perspectives to meet and discuss sensitive and difficult issues of mutual interest in a neutral setting. The purpose is to exchange scientific information  and discussion across sectors and institutions, and to illuminate issues, not resolve them. Specific agenda topics will be determined by the Roundtable membership, but will focus on areas such as: enhancing environmental health in health care; clinical and environmental health research strategies; susceptible populations; and workforce and health professional education.  The Roundtable will not provide advice or recommendations on any specific issue or policy pending before any government agency; summary reports will result from the conferences, but will not contain recommendations. The U.S. EPA intends on soliciting the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), Institute of Medicine (IOM) 500 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20001 as the sole candidate  pursuant to FAR 6.302-1"Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  The NAS IOM has been the lead in planning for the roundtable of discussions since 2000.  NAS IOM has the unique ability to convene committees of experts from academia, industrial, consumer, and federal perspectives to meet and discuss sensitive and difficult issues of mutual interest in a neutral setting.   NAICS Code 541611 applies with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFP) is available.  Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFP will be ignored.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: John Southerland Jr (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Subpart 13. It is SSA's belief that Irvine Access Floors, Inc. is the only source qualified to meet our needs because it is the only authorized distributor of Cii parts and materials for the Baltimore, MD region.   This notice is for informational purposes only and is neither a request for quotation nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Interested parties that believe they are capable of providing these services can submit a capability statement to Kimberly Huttenberger via email at Kimberly.Huttenberger@ssa.gov no later than 4:30pm, EST, January 23, 2008.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Kathleen Jones, 703-325-1723
<DESC>1.	BACKGROUND INFORMATION<BR>1.1	Purpose<BR>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to provide industry, government service providers, and other interested parties a vehicle to describe solution(s) and implementation approaches for an en terprise-wide funds distribution capability for the Department of Defense (DoD). Responses to this RFI will assist the Enterprise Funds Distribution (EFD) initiative incorporate best-practice strategies, alternatives, and experiences into an Acquisition st rategy for developing and implementing an enterprise-wide solution(s) for the Department. <BR>1.2	Description<BR>The EFD initiative was established in 2006 as a key initiative to provide full visibility of funds distributed throughout the DoD and to stream line and modernize disparate funds distribution systems.  At an enterprise level, there exist gaps and inefficiencies among the separate and distinct funds distribution practices throughout the Department.  Funds distribution by its nature should be a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems.  The concept of a fully visible enterprise-wide funds distribution capability serves as a reference within which planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place.  <BR>Specif ic objectives of the EFD initiative are to transform the Departments funds management and distribution capabilities to provide:<BR>"	Full visibility and auditability of appropriated funds as they pass through and across the enterprise;<BR>"	Streamlined fu nds distribution processes for all appropriations and standardize funds distribution data;<BR>"	Integrated funds distribution and Congressional Marks tracking processes to provide significantly enhanced funds distribution visibility.<BR>"	Flexibility of th e Business Rules associated with the funds distribution<BR>1.3	Scope<BR>EFD capabilities are primarily required by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and DoD Components from the time the Presidents Budget is submitted to Congress until appropriated fu nds are apportioned and allocated to the Components.  During that timeframe, EFD capabilities enable tracking of congressional actions, establishment of budget authority, and the distribution of funds to the Components.  <BR>Specific EFD capabilities inclu de apportionment processing, funds distribution and redistribution of appropriated funds, reprogramming of appropriated funds, and funds control for distributions, rescission management and enterprise reporting (e.g., production of the DD 1414, DD1415 and DD1416 reports).  <BR>Additionally, EFD will serve as a key enabler to the implementation of the Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS), consistently providing key funding data (e.g., Department Regular Code, Main Account Code, etc.) including the  Organization Unique Identifier (OUID ).   EFD will leverage OUIDs to establish a financial management organization structure, here within referred to as the FM OUID Alias structure.   <BR>The EFD capabilities will be used by all organizations down to leve l 3 of the Financial Management OUID Alias structure and for all levels, down to level 7 of the FM OUID Alias structure, for TI-97 appropriations.<BR>1.4	Instructions for Responding to the RFI Questionnaire (Part II)<BR>The RFI Questionnaire (Part 2) is di vided into the following sections.<BR>Section 2.1 - requests information about your organization. You MUST respond to this section.<BR>Section 2.2 - requests responses to enterprise-wide funds distribution responsibilities and reporting capabilities.  Thes e capabilities are described further in section 3 of this RFI. (10 Pages Limit)<BR>Section 2.3 - requests responses related to technical-based requirements. (10 Pages Limit)<BR>Section 2.4 - provides an opportunity to provide additional information beyond the questions found in Section 2.2 and 2.3 that you feel should be considered to meet the purpose of this RFI.  We are interested in both your actual experience  and your recommendations about what would work best to achieve the goals and objectives of an enterprise-wide funds distribution solution. <BR>The government recognizes that many potential respondents will only have information pertaining to a portion of the RFI. However, partial information may be of high quality and significant value to the EFD initiative.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT

Contracting Office Address: U.S. Census Bureau, Suitland, MD 20746
General Information: Pre-Solicitation
Solicitation Number: YA1323CLK0000
NAICS Code: 519120-Libraries and Archives

The U.S. Census Bureau intends to conduct an 8(a) Business development program contract and the requirement shall be awarded on the basis of competition limited to eligible 8(a) firms who are under the authorized NAICS Code 519120, not to exceed the limitation of $ 6.5 million for a Library Services Contract. Any company that fails to meet this requirement will not be eligible for the award. The Census Bureau Library provides the divisions with technical expertise, services and products in the areas of resource control and utilization. To provide the fastest and most comprehensive research support and product development, the Census Bureau Library maintains an extensive and unique collection of specialized data and documentation, as well as a worldwide network of outside resources as needed.

The BOC Library has approximately 200,000 volumes, with approximately half of the volumes located in the U.S. Collection on the first level, and half in the International Collection located on the second level of the BOC Library, at the Suitland Federal Center. The Census Bureau Library houses about 114,000 foreign language volumes, and a special collection containing historic U.S. censuses.

The Census Bureau Library implemented an integrated automation system using SIRSI/DYNIX Unicorn database on a Windows 2000 Server in 1999. Various library functions, including cataloging, circulation, and acquisitions are to be carried out under the SIRSI/DYNIX Unicorn library management system. The objective is to seek a contractor that will provide expert advice and assistance required by the BOC library to meet their high standard goals in these work areas:

1.	General Programs/Project Management  
2.	Circulation
3.	Intra-library Loans
4.	Reference Services
5.	Cataloging
6.	Collection Development and Acquisition
7.	SIRSI/DYNIX Support & Administration

The acquisition strategy will utilize the advisory multi-step process (hereafter called Voluntary Down Select) as described in FAR 15.202 and FAR 16.505. Phase I will be the release of a Draft RFP Section C, L, & M, and Down Select Questions which will be attached to this document. This information will contain sufficient information to permit a potential vendor to make an informed decision about whether to participate in this acquisition (i.e. they possess demonstrated past experience as a prime successfully managing programs of similar size, scope, and complexity). Any questions or comments prior to vendors response to down select questions dealing with Sections C, L, & M shall be submitted January 25, 2008 by 3:00 pm to the original point of contacts listed below. Governments responses to these questions and comments will be posted on this site (http://www.fedbizopps.com) by January 30, 2008 by 1:00 pm. 

The Down Select Questions will request information on past performance, experience, and a technical executive summary. For evaluation purposes, past performance will describe how well contractor's performed work, and experience will reflect whether contractors have performed work similar in scope and magnitude to ACSD's requirement. All interested vendors that feel they would be interested in this draft solicitation shall submit their responses to the eight (8) Down Select Questions (refer to Section L) by February 4, 2008 at 1:00 PM EST to the original point of contacts listed below. The Technical Evaluation Team (TET) will use their expertise to identify the most highly rated vendors from the Phase I submissions in relation to the requirements set forth in Section C. In doing so, the TET will identify the discriminating strengths, weaknesses, and risks for each response. Based on the evaluation and findings of the TET, the Contracting Officer will select a maximum of five (5) Best Qualified Vendors (BQV's) to participate in Phase II of the selection process. This announcement will take place February 11, 2008. The Census Bureau will advise each vendor via email whether it has been selected to participate in Phase II no later than 3:00 pm, Friday February 11, 2008. If a debriefing is desired, the vendor must request in writing a debriefing within five (5) workdays (Monday-Friday) after the non-select notice has been made. These requests shall be sent to the emails listed below.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice only, with specific interest in small business capability.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from qualified small businesses and to conduct market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 (please see attached market research questions).  No solicitation is being issued at this time.  This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.  The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB), Colorado, seeks potential sources to perform a variety of non-personal Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) and Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) services in support of Headquarters, Air Force Space Command (HQ AFSPC), PAFB, Colorado.

This requirement shall also consist of several phases of planning, programming, acquisition, and implementation cycles of various Government systems to complement the Government?s technical expertise in accomplishing its mission.  In rendering the foregoing services, outputs may take the form of information, advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, and training services.  Work under this contract will require security clearances.  For reference purposes, the solicitation, when issued, will be numbered FA2517-08-R-9000 and will be a Request for Proposal (RFP).  A best value source selection will likely be the method of contractor selection.  Work performed under the current HQ AFSPC contract will be accessible at the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS) website.  It is anticipated the contract performance period will be a base period of five years with no option periods, and the program?s ceiling value will be approximately $400 million. Most of the work is expected to be performed on PAFB.  The Government is contemplating award of a multiple award Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract with firm fixed price and cost type contract line item numbers (CLINs).  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences, with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. No decision has yet been made regarding the small business strategy for this contract.  However, in anticipation of addressing bundling issues, the Government is specifically assessing the availability and potential of small business to perform this work.  Small business is advised that FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, would apply wherein at least 50 percent of the work must be performed by the small business prime contractor alone.

<DESC>**** Description of A, and D.3 have been modified *****

TITLE:  INDOOR POOL BULK HEAD

A.       General Information

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  The purpose of this sources sought notice is to communicate with industry in advance, receive a feed back from the industry, identify interested vendors to foster competition, and use the information gained from this notice to further define the requirement of the expected solicitation in a way which benefits both the Government and the contractor.  Please contact POC below for more details.  

B.       Products & Performance Required

Overview: Design, construct and install a moveable deck level bulkhead for a six  lane 50 meter L shaped pool.  The bulkhead will be used in the 50 meter competitive/lap swimming area of the pool.  The bulkhead is used to separate the pool into two sections: a Federation Internationale de Natation (FINA) sanctioned 25 meter course; an approximately 25-26 yard (non-sanctioned) course. 

1.  The bulkhead must be movable from a 25 meter mark at pool?s midway point and transit to the pool?s deep-end wall to allow a 50 yard course.  The bulkhead WILL NOT run from the pool?s midway point to the shallow end.  The bulkhead will have variable buoyancy to lessen weight during movement for easy repositioning.

2.  The bulkhead will be supplied with rails to push the bulkhead into position for locking/resting in place.  A removable stainless steel safety railing with sleeves at  installation points will be provided along the non-competitive side of the bulkhead to protect those persons on the bulkhead from stepping off backwards.
  
3.  The bulkhead needs to submerge when a full 50 meter course in needed.  The bulkhead should be able to re-float in less than 30 minutes from full submersion in the 11 feet depth of the pool.

4. The bulkhead must be able to separate into two movable sections.  Each section, when separated) would equal three lane widths (approximately 27 feet long).  The two sections need to interlock for positive connection when the requirement demands that a bulkhead extends the full width of the pool.  When the bulkhead sections are separated a locking/anchoring mechanism will be employed to keep the free ends from moving. 

5.  The bulkhead will have a complete flow-through design for wave absorption.

6.  The bulkhead will be made of special grade 304L and 316L stainless steel and have a certified slip-resistant grating on the bulkhead?s top and side surfaces for safety.  The exterior cladding will be of an exterior grade PVC composite compound with an integrally machined surfacing that is ASTM 1028C slip resistant certified.  

7.  The bulkhead will be designed to eliminate entrapments from sides and underneath.  Between the bulkhead on pool wall, a side tolerance of not more than 5/16 of an inch are required to keep hands and feet from entrapment or pinning.  An adjustable skirt below the bulkhead is required when there is a depth of water 24 inches or less to prohibit swimming beneath the bulkhead.  

8.  The bulkhead will be designed to accommodate competitive racing lane lines for  both the 25 meter and 26 yard courses.  

9. The bulkhead will include competitive starting blocks supplied by the contractor for six lanes facing the 25 meter course.  

10.  FINA approved wall targets will be applied to the turning surfaces of both sides of the bulkhead. 

11.  The bulkhead will be designed with integral cable tray to easily accept the Natatorium?s electronic timing system touch pads and to run all necessary cabling to connect the timing system for competitive events.  

12.  The designer will furnish all material, equipment, supervision, insurance, and other items necessary to provide a complete working bulkhead system.

13.  All design drawing and specifications shall be submitted under the seal of a registered professional engineer for approval by the base civil engineer (BCE) architects.

14.  The designer will coordinate all phases of the design and installation with the BCE. 

15.  The designer provides a ten (10) year Manufactures Warranty against defects in materials or workmanship for all components of the bulkhead.  The stainless steel truss will be warranted for a period of fifteen (15) years.   

C.       Instructions to Interested Vendors

1.  By going through the Government?s requirement specified above, interested vendors may e-mail the company?s name, e-mail address and phone number, past performance information for the same or similar products and homepage address so that we can include the company in our mailing list when RFQ is issued.  

2.  The Government welcomes comments from the industry on the requirement above so that we can tailor our requirement better.  For example, a vendor may criticize the requirement from safety prospective, or suggest a trend of the industry, or suggest the alternative such as other than stainless steel.  Both positive and negative comment is welcome.  The Government is interested in receiving comment on safety prospective, e.g., accident report for the similar product and the way to prevent such accident in our procurement.

3.  The Government also welcomes any comment from the industry on the commercial practice on periodic inspection, maintenance and repair.  

4.  The Government also welcomes any comment from the industry on our planned evaluation criteria below.  Both positive and negative comment is welcome.  The Government is interested in receiving comment in a way which benefits both the Government and the contractor.  

5.  The Government plans to issue the RFQ on this after Feb 08 but not later than Sep 08.

D.       Planned Evaluation Criteria

1.  Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) with Technical Proposal.  

2.  Past performance will be approximately equal to price.  All technically acceptable offers will be treated equally except for the prices and performance records.  

3.  Technical proposal on the product itself can be just a pamphlet or any other ready available information.  However, the technical proposal shall include the information for on-site installation, inspection, maintenance and repair if there is no local agent in Japan.   

4.  The Government plans to evaluate the quotations in an efficient and minimally burdensome fashion, i.e., no formal evaluation plan or no scoring quotations.

<DESC>The Office of Contract Operations, Major Systems Acquisition Division, of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Headquarters expects to release Request for Proposal (RFP) No. HSCG23-08-R-ADA011 to procure Increment 2 Phase I of the Nationwide Automatic Identification System (NAIS).  The expected release date for the RFP is on or about December 20, 2007.  The USCG contemplates an award of one hybrid type contract.

The NAIS, which uses international standards-based Automatic Identification System (AIS) technology for ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore and shore-to-ship communication of navigation information to support Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), is being implemented by the USCG incrementally.  Increment 1, which was completed at the end of FY 2007, is operational and providing receive-only capability in 55 critical ports and 9 coastal areas across the country.  Increment 2, to be implemented over two phases, will establish coastal transmit and receive capability nationwide.  Increment 3 will provide long-range receive capability nationwide.  Phase 2 of Increment 2 and Increment 3 will be the subject of separate procurements.

Increment 2 Phase I, which is the subject of this RFP, involves the work necessary to design, develop and deliver the core NAIS capability, achieve NAIS receive and transmit coverage for three designated Coast Guard Sectors to establish Initial Operational Capability (IOC); and, to provide systems engineering, physical and logical shore stations hardware and software, initial logistics, and Sector coverage design services to support post-IOC deployment towards achieving Full Operational Capability (FOC) or complete receive and transmit coverage.

This core system shall provide all of the necessary I-2 functionality for a fully-capable system, albeit with a limited number of Physical Shore Stations (PSSs) and Logical Shore Stations (LSSs).  The core capability of the NAIS, which is a subset of the IOC, is defined as the following system elements or capabilities:

<DESC>Request for Information
Air Force Medical Service Commodity Council (AFMSCC)
Overseas Clinical and Medical Administrative Support Services
As of 22 Jan 08
 
This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the government to acquire any product or services.  It does not guarantee a subsequent solicitation will be issued.  Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary, and costs associated with any submission shall not be reimbursed by the Government.  The information requested will be used by the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) to facilitate decision making.

The Air Force Medical Service Commodity Council (AFMSCC) is seeking interested sources to provide information capabilities and capacities prividing clinical and medical administrative support services in Air Force military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in Japan, South Korea, Italy, England, Germany, Portugal and Turkey.  The presumed requirement would be to augment existing clinical and medical support services provided by Air Force military personnel, DoD civilian employees or other contract staff.

Clinical Support Services are defined for this purpose as any occupation that engages in direct patient care activities such as physicians, nurses, medical technicians, pharmacists and laboratory professionals.  Medical Administrative Support Services are defined as any occupations that support the operations of the medical facility such as appointing, coding, medical records, transcription, referral/utilization management and clerical support.  The program may also include some highly technical positions such as biomedical equipment repair technicians, industrial hygiene technicians and materials handlers.

Currently, these services are procured when needed by each MTF using a local base contracting office, other contracting offices at other bases, centralized contracts and other non-agency contracts.  The AFMSCC seeks to develop a long-term contract vehicle to satisfy demand by establishing pre-priced labor categories so MTFs may place orders as needs arise.  By leveraging resources, defining common requirements and specifications, the agency desires to simplify the acquisition process and reduce the ordering lead time for the requesting location.  There has not been any determination concerning the number, scope and geographic coverage of requirements associated with this area of interest.  

The AFMSCC seeks to learn from industry the unique aspects or procedures mandated for recruiting, placing and retaining clinical and medical administrative support personnel for overseas employment.  Preliminary research suggests that the scope of the contracts might exceed the capabilities of small business; however, the agency seeks large and small business respondents who are currently conducting business or providing health care services outside the United States or are interested in doing so.  The input will help the Air Force ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity of all potential offerors.  A review of available North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) codes finds that NAICS 621111 (Office of Physicians) and NAICS 621999 (All Other Miscellaneous Ambulatory Health Care Service) both have a size standard of $9M (3-year average of annual receipts).  Although 621111 will be the primary NAICS code for clinical requirements, work under 621330 (Offices of Mental Health Practitioners, except Physicians) may also be required.  Comments on the NAICS code selection are welcomed.  If you are an interested large or small business, please complete the attached questionnaire and provide the name, phone number, and e-mail address of a company representative the Government may contact for additional information.  E-mailed responses are required.  

Notice:  The Air Force has non-government (contractor) employees assisting with its market research.  These non-government employees, who have all signed nondisclosure agreements, will have access to industry responses.  
Information gained through this RFI will be used to further define the AFMS requirements.  Individual capability briefs will not be accepted at this time.  Interested parties are urged to monitor the official Government Point of Entry at www.fedbizopps.gov for future announcements regarding AFMS needs.  It is the responsibility of interested parties to check this site regularly for any changes or updates.  Vendors can subscribe to the FedBizOpps Vendor Notification Service to receive emails notifying them of all notices for a particular solicitation number, all notices from selected organizations and product service classifications (NAICS codes) or all procurement notices.  To register for this service, click on "Vendor Notification Service" at the FedBizOpps home page.  Then click on the subscription option desired and follow the instructions.  This service is provided for convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification. Subscribers to this list service are ultimately responsible for reviewing the Federal Business Opportunities site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions. 
Please note, the government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI.  

Send responses to the following POCs no later than 1 Feb 08.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ is seeking sources/information for :  2 each Exhaust Valve Panel Assembly, P/N 610708-2.
  The exhaust valve assembly consists mainly of a valve body (heavy weldment), a disk supported by a crankshaft, and an actuator assembly.  A limit switch, activated by a switch actuator cam, is attached to the crankshaft.  The actuator assembly is attached to the valve body and connected to the crankshaft by linkages.  The exhaust valve is opened when pressurized hydraulic fluid from the exhaust valve hydraulic lock valve is directed to port A.  This moves the actuator piston and crosshead upward causing the crankshaft and disk to rotate off the valve body seat.  Spent steam is then free to pass through the exhaust valve via the attached overboard discharge line.  The exhaust valve is closed when pressurized hydraulic fluid from the exhaust valve hydraulic lock valve is directed to port B.
  This moves the actuator piston and crosshead in an downward direction causing the crankshaft and attached disk to move to the closed position  ( disk seated ).  In the closed position , the limit switch is activated.  Switch activation is required to allow the electrical launch sequence to continue.
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  No solicitation package is available.  Respondents to this request for information are invited to submit a statement of general interest; a description of any currently available unit which meets our requirements and/or a discussion on the feasibility of the above described unit.

<SUBJECT>17 -- ARRESTING GEAR ENGINE
<SOLNBR>N68335-08-RFI-0070
<RESPDATE>022508
<ARCHDATE>03112008
<CONTACT>Deborah Dewyea, Contract Specialist, Phone 732-323-7068, Fax 732-323-7192, Email deborah.dewyea@navy.mil - Jennifer Vaccaro, Contract Specialist, Phone 732-323-5129, Fax 732-323-4822, Email vaccarojl@navair.navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ is seeking sources/information for :  2 each Arresting Gear Engine (2)-3s, (1)-4, P/N 50-61937-3/4
The arresting engine transforms the pull of the purchase cable into hydraulic resistance in order to stop an aircraft during an aircraft carrier landing.  The arresting engine consists of: an Accumulator and Air expansion Flasks, Retract Valve, Fixed Sheave Assembly, Crosshead Assembly, Fluid Cooler, Manifold, Fairlead Installation, Cylinder and RAM assembly, Constant Runout Valve (CROV) drive system and CROV.  This is an extremely complicated manufacture with heavy weldments, castings, extensive machining, plating with radiographic and other stringent inspection criteria.   There are numerous flight critical components.  
  The Accumulator is the receiving chamber for engine cylinder fluid displaced by the engine ram during and arrestment.   
  The air expansion flasks contain the pressurized air charge maintained against the piston on the air side of the accumulator piston.  The accumulator and the air expansion flasks are mounted in saddles located on the engine structure.   
     The fixed sheave assembly is a bank of sheaves secured to the engine structure and consisting of two groups of rotating sheaves.  There are nine sheaves in each group and each group is mounted on an individual shaft.  
     Crosshead Assembly is secured to the outer end of the engine ram by ring segments, which fit into grooves around the end of the ram.  The sheave arrangement for the crosshead is basically the same as in the fixed sheave assembly.  Fairlead tubing is secured to the ram end at the crosshead body to guide reeved purchase cable to the fixed sheave assembly.  Since the crosshead moves with the ram, slippers are mounted on each corner of the crosshead body and are held in place with brass retainers.  The slippers ride on tracks located on the side of the engine structure.  These slippers support the weight of the crosshead and keep the crosshead level during operations.  When the crosshead is fully extended at the end of a retraction stroke, it is in the battery position.  When an arrestment occurs, the crosshead assembly is pulled toward the fixed sheave end of the arresting engine.  
     The CROV provides stopping force for the arresting engine and aircraft during an arrestment.  It meters the flow of pressurized fluid from the main engine cylinder to the accumulator as the aircraft is pulling out the purchase cable via the Cross Deck Pendant (CDP).  Fluid is forced from the main engine cylinder through the manifold and elbow and into the control valve.  The control valve drive system, operated in conjunction with the travel of the crosshead, rotates the control valve cam progressively closing the valve.  The adjustable anchor assembly, secured to and moving with the engine crosshead, pulls the control valve cable and chain assembly to rotate the cam.  A combination ram travel and flight deck runout dial mounted in the cam housing along with a pointer mounted to the cam shaft translates cam motion into ram travel (inches) and flight deck runout (feet).  The control valve is equipped with a balancing chamber which allows pressurized fluid to balance the pressure both above and below the sleeve in the upper chamber of the valve to prevent excessive loading on the plunger and levers during an arrestment.  Pressurized fluid from the engine cylinder is channeled through the valve body and bears against the shoulder at the upper portion of the sleeve.  This downward force on the sleeve prevents the sleeve from slamming up into the lower lever as engine fluid raises the stem. The cam rotation, plunger and lever arrangement forces down on the sleeve which, in turn, causes the stem to move down to a closed position.  The valve stem movement meters fluid flow from the entire cylinder to accumulator.     The CROV drive system converts the linear movement of the engine crosshead into cam rotation.  Cam rotation controls the progressive closing of the control valve during runout.  An adjustable anchor secured to and moving with the crosshead, pulls the control valve cable and chain over pulley sprockets to rotate the control valve cam.  The ram travel and flight deck runout dial converts cam motion into ram travel (inches) and flight deck runout (feet).  As permanent cable stretch occurs, the adjustable anchor provides the means to realign the ?battery? index mark on the cam with the mark on the cam housing. 
     The cylinder and ram assembly is located within the engine structure between the elbow assembly and the crosshead.  When the engine is in battery position the cylinder is full of fluid.  When the engine is actuated through pull of the purchase cable, movement of the crosshead forces the ram into cylinder.  This action forces the fluid from the cylinder through the control valve and into the accumulator.  During retraction, accumulator air pressure forces that displaces fluid back to the  cylinder causing the ram and crosshead to return to ?battery? position.  
    The fluid cooler system is provided to cool engine fluid as it is returned from the engine accumulator to the engine cylinder.  Fluid flows through the cooler body and heat is transferred to tubes containing cool water.  
     The retracting valve assembly returns displaced engine cylinder fluid from the engine accumulator back to the engine cylinder after completion of an arrestment.  The fluid, forced by compressed air in the accumulator and air flasks, flows from the accumulator through the fluid cooler, fluid filter and back into the engine cylinder.  The fluid forces the ram and crosshead away from the engine cylinder and fixed sheave assembly, causing the purchase cable and CDP to be retracted to ?battery? position.

Respondents to this request for information are invited to submit a statement of general interest; a description of any currently available unit which meets our requirements and/or a discussion on the feasibility of the above described unit.

<DESC>Description

The Space Innovation and Development Center (SIDC) is hereby issuing this announcement for continued support to the Aerospace Fusion Center (AFC) Operations and Maintenance Support and other in-scope Research & Development efforts.  Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems (NGES), 1100 West Hollyvale Street, Azusa, California 91702, is currently performing this effort under the Rapid Prototyping, Integration, and Development (RaPID) Contract, FA2550-04-C-3008.  The current AFC contractual coverage ends on 30 Sep 2008 and is being performed on a sole-source basis.  To maintain continuity for future AFC requirements, a basic year of contract support with four one-year options for this continued support is anticipated.  The requirement consists of seamlessly extending support for AFC and its customers by supporting the center?s operational software, the Space Awareness and Global Exploitation (SAGE) system, the Static Infrared Emitter (SIRE) processor, SAGE client displays, and affiliated hardware, software, crypto, and communications lines.  This also involves using SAGE to analyze events in both real-time and playback mode; integrating and tuning of advanced Overhead Non-Imaging InfraRed (ONIR) fusion algorithms in SAGE; providing operational performance assessment; incorporating mission performance improvements on SAGE; and system administration functions.  Although the facility is staffed on a 5-day per week, 8 hour schedule, the SAGE system and SIRE processor operate on a 24/7 basis, and the capability must exist to respond within 2 hours of hardware or software failure.  In event of contingencies or schedule conflicts, the AFC can be staffed 24/7 for a limited period of time.  The AFC is a development facility located in the Missile Defense Integration and Operations Center (MDIOC) at Schriever AFB CO.  The contractor personnel who perform the operations and maintenance portion of the AFC are required to have current Top Secret/Secure Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) security clearances and must qualify for clearance to the appropriate program level.  NGES is the manufacturer of the Defense Satellite Program (DSP) sensor and developer of the AFC?s software suite which includes the SAGE system, the SIRE processor, the Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) Automatic Track Transfer processor, Missile Defense Agency?s (MDA?s) External Sensors Lab (ESL) algorithms, New Foreign Launch-Prototype algorithm, and Walker algorithms.  In addition, NGES has access to raw satellite data critical to the AFC?s functions and dedicated communication lines to deliver that data into the AFC.  The contractor must be capable of providing information to the AFC via communication lines at a minimum rate of 9 MB/sec of data transfer.  Facilities that replicate the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Mission Control Station (MCS) to include actual SBIRS hardware, software, and real-time data feeds are also required.  The contractor must also be able to seamlessly and quickly take over the troubleshooting and development of the SAGE system, the SIRE processor, the HEO Automatic Track Transfer processor, the fusion of classified ONIR data sources in real-time into SAGE, and continue development and support of the MDA?s ESL missile defense algorithms for state vector improvement.  The contractor must also possess the expertise to fuse all DoD ONIR satellites in SAGE in real-time and be able to perform the operations and maintenance of SAGE servers and client workstations running at the AFC and at the AFC?s customer locations.  The contractor is also required to have existing supplier and maintenance agreements in-place for all existing AFC hardware to include computer, networking, video and crypto equipment.  Additionally, the contractor is required to possess the capability to transmit data in real-time from non-operational DSP satellites, some of which may not be available from the SBIRS MCS.  The period of performance for this projected effort is expected to commence on 01 Oct 2008.  This contract will transition the AFC effort from the current RaPID Contract, FA2550-04-C-3008, to a contractual vehicle with an estimated annual budgeted value of $14M administered by 50 CONS in conjunction with the SIDC.  This announcement shall not be considered a request for offers.  However, interested parties are invited to submit a statement of technical capabilities not to exceed ten pages that includes the following information:  1) Company name, mailing address, points of contacts and telephone numbers; 2) Business size classification, Large, Small or Other; 3) Experience in operating and maintaining the spiral development of the SAGE and SIRE software and hardware to include all current and planned sensors over the next 5-10 years; 4) Experience in real-time exploitation of ONIR systems for Battlespace Awareness, Missile Defense, Space Situation Awareness, and Missile Warning and putting those capabilities into SAGE and SIRE; 5) facilities to work at the appropriate security levels up to and including SCI.  Statements of Capabilities are due by Close Of Business (COB) 07 Feb 08.  The Government will not pay any costs associated with preparation of Statement of Capabilities.  Due to the highly specialized nature of this requirement, the Government requests that only those firms possessing or capable of acquiring the requisite resources to perform this contract submit a Statement of Capabilities.  All written responses shall be submitted to 50 CONS/LGCZH, Attn: Robert Wind, 210 Falcon Parkway, Suite 2116, Schriever AFB, CO 80912-2116.  Direct technical questions to Mr. James Andros, (719) 721-9091 and contractual questions to Mr. Robert Wind, (719) 567-3565.

After review of the responses to this announcement, the Government intends to proceed with the acquisition and a subsequent solicitation will be published.     The Governments intent is to solicit a Firm Fixed Price, Best Value Procurement. TENTATIVE (subject to change):  Scope of Work  The War Related Illness and Injury Study Center (WRIISC) at the VA New Jersey Healthcare System in East Orange, New Jersey (EOVA) started in 2001 to address post-deployment health needs of combat veterans. The program has four areas of focus as its founding mission: research, education, risk communication and clinical services. Three years ago the management team of the WRIISC recognized the synergy and overlap of the latter three of these foci and put them administratively  under a single Associate Director of Clinical, Education and Risk Communication Services (AD-CERC). This procurement is for a contractor to provide AD-CERC services outlined within. The WRIISC is overseen by a Director and two Associate Directors (Associate Director Research and Associate Director CERC). These three individuals jointly make management decisions for the entire WRIISC and frequently cover for each other in case of absence. These individuals represent the WRIISC at such hospital-wide groups as the Executive Committee of the Medical Staff and such national groups as the Defense Health Board. The overall visibility of the WRIISC has grown substantially over the past two years, with numerous opportunities and requirements for public speaking. The Contractor will be required to speak on behalf of the WRIISC in a variety of venues. Past speaking obligations have included presentations to VA national Senior Leadership, The Presidential Commission on Veterans' Health, national, regional and local continuing education seminars and hospital senior staff meetings. Any and all of these may recur and new opportunities arise regularly, including media interviews.

<CONTACT>Gregory Harris, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3181
<DESC>The US Army Office of the Program Manager Close Combat Systems (OPMCCS), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 is conducting a Market Survey to identify  potential sources to develop and integrate technology enhancements for the XM- 7 Networked Command Munition ýýý Spider that is currently in production.  System  enhancements will be integrated into future production of Spider systems and  will address the intent of the FY07 committee language associated with the  Spider program.  It is envisioned that work associated with the system  enhancements will take place over a period of 24 months.  The Spider system  currently in production meets the Presidentýýýs Anti-Personnel Landmine (APL)  policy with regards to Non-Self Destruct/Self-Destruct APL.   Spider is a stand-alone weapon system consisting of three main hardware  components: a Remote Control Station (RCS), a Repeater for extended  communications, and a Munition Control Unit (MCU), capable of containing up to  six individual Miniature Grenade Launchers (MGLs).  Spider will be compatible  with the U.S. Army battlefield key management infrastructure and the Navy  Electronic Key Management System (EKMS).  Spider must meet the COMSEC and  Transmission Security (TRANSEC) requirements contained in the Spider Security  Policy.  Spider is currently using removable media compatible with the Force  XXI Battle Command Battalion/Brigade and Below (FBCB2), an indirect  interface.   Since the Spider systems fulfill current requirements, the contractor must be  able to meet an expedited development and integration schedule.  There is  urgency in completing the Spider production and fielding as many systems as  possible to fill the operational capability void that will exist after 31  December 2010, the date that the US will no longer utilize persistent  landmines.  In order to mitigate the capability gap that will exist after 2010  it is required to procure and field quantities using the programs developed  LRIP manufacturing line.  Technology enhancement development and integration  efforts will transition into production and continue to support providing  Spider capability to the field to address the stated capability gap.  Interested contractors must have the necessary equipment and skills to conduct  the stated technology enhancement development and integration efforts to meet  our program requirements.  The XM-7 Spider system is built to a performance  specification and the Government does not have a mature Technical Data  Package.  This market survey is for information and planning purposes only,  does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed  as a commitment by the U.S. Government.  The Government implies no intention  or opportunity to acquire funding for the stated research and development  activity or to support current or future production efforts.  If a formal  solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be  published.  No award will be made as a result of this market survey.  All  information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.   The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private  sector input as a result of this market survey.   The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this  survey.  Interested parties are requested to provide information regarding  relevant capabilities and manufacturing experience, including a brief summary  of their companyýýýs capabilities, manufacturing and testing experience.   The point of contact for this action is Mr. Greg Harris, Contract Specialist,  (973) 724-3181.  All responding sources should submit their responses no later  than February 8, 2008 to The Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle  Management Command, Close Combat Systems Contracting Group (A),  Bldg. 10,  Attn: Mr. Greg Harris, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&L LCMC) Close Combat Systems Contracting Center, Picatinny, NJ 07806-5000  is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources to fabricate,  inspect, test, and deliver XM216 Aircraft Countermeasure Flares.  The XM216 is  used to protect the US Army (and potentially other services) fixed and rotary  wing aircraft from infrared guided threats.  Initial delivery would be for  approximately 15,000 units within three to six months after award and, subject  to the availability of funds, an estimated delivery of 25,000-40,000 units per  month for a maximum contract length of five years.  The flares will need to  meet Army requirements for airworthiness, effectiveness, reliability,  interface and interoperability, environment, shelf and service life.  These  requirements are still in the developmental phase.  These flares are to  replace or supplement the current Advanced Infrared Countermeasure Munition  (AIRCMM) Solution and are essential to provide Army aircraft protection  against current and advanced surface-to-air and air-to-air infrared guided  threats. These flares are required to fulfill ongoing requirements for  Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. As such, the  contractor must be able to meet an expedited delivery schedule utilizing a Non- Developmental Item (NDI).   If available responses should include the following information: 	- Level of flare development, i.e.: lab scale, prototype, production  ready.  	- Time-intensity plots of the flare IR output (Watts/steradian) in the  mid and near     IR regions measured statically and dynamically (flight  conditions for a helicopter traveling at an airspeed of 120 knots or any other  dynamic test data). 	- Visible spectra measurement in the photopic region: Candela vs. time  when measured with a photocell with an f'1 of 3.00 or less. 	- Flare trajectory, ejection velocity and set-back force. 	- Effectiveness of the flare against infrared guided surface-to-air  missile threats. 	- Estimated cost for the flare in test quantities of 3000-5000 units  as well as unit price for production quantities. 	- Insensitive Munitions test data. Interested parties that believe they can meet the above requirements shall  provide their capabilities in R&D, manufacturing, and testing.  Responses  should include their current business structures: (a) name of Company-include  contact personýýýs name, company address, telephone numbers (voice and fax), e- mail address, (b) Company size (i.e. large, foreign, small disadvantaged,  veteran owned, woman owned, etc) Included in the submission should be current  major manufacturing processes, critical skills and equipment, and current  production capabilities, which should include the maximum production rate  attainable and minimum sustaining rate. The organizationýýýs facilities,  equipment, unique capabilities, environmental concerns, storage, shipping,  receiving and other support functions, such as testing capabilities for  conducting acceptance testing of the end product should also be identified. It  is also requested that respondents provide an estimated unit cost for 15,000  each units.  This market survey is for information and planning purposes only, does not  constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a  commitment by the U.S. Government. The Government implies no intention or  opportunity to acquire funding to support current or future production  efforts.

<SUBJECT>D -- Sole Source Extension of Existing Contract  for FFDO Dashboard System
<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) / Office of Law Enforcement-Federal Air Marshal Service's Contracts & Procurement Branch, on behalf of the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program, intends to negotiate and award on a sole source basis, a contract modification to extend Contract No. HSTS01-05-C-WPT782 with Performance Assessment Network, Inc. for a period of one year under the authority of section 3.2.2.4 of the TSA Acquisition Management System.   The purpose of this extension is to ensure the continuity of technical services to support the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) dashboard while a concurrent effort to redefine requirements, design, develop, and implement a government owned and managed technical solution for the FFDO dashboard is pursued.  Support is required for the period extending from March 1, 2008 through February 28, 2009.
Because Performance Assessment Networks was the developer of the FFDO dashboard and owns the proprietary test delivery platform upon which the dashboard is based, Performance Assessment Networks is the only responsible source capable of providing the necessary services within the specified timeframe.  The dashboard supports the assessment of FFDO applicants through the initial training, re-qualification and re-current training requirements and provides TSA with critical FFDO statistical information in real-time.  As a result, any lapse in service would be detrimental to the FFDO program requirements and to national security. 
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, as no solicitation package will be issued.   However, if a company believes it can meet the requirements within the prescribed timeframe, it may give notification via e-mail to the point of contacts listed below no later than January 28, 2008, 5:00 PM, Eastern Time.

A determination not to compete the proposed acquisition, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, TSA will proceed with a sole-source negotiation with Performance Assessment Network, Inc. Email responses may be sent to the following:  Kari Santoro, Mgt & Prgm Analyst, Phone 609.909.5736, Email kari.santoro@dhs.gov;  Nancy Ballay, Contracting Officer, Phone 609.909.5704, Email nancy.ballay@dhs.gov

<SUBJECT>B -- STATE-OF-THE-SCIENCE EVIDENCE-BASED REVIEW OF THE DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF FOOD ALLERGY
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION NOTICE. This is a Request for Information (RFI) synopsis. There is no solicitation available at this time. The Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) at the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) is requesting information to determine the availability of qualified contractors to produce an evidence-based literature report that will summarize the state of the science for definition, diagnosis, and management of food allergy.

The NIAID plans to use this evidence-based report, in conjunction with consensus expert opinion, to develop clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of food allergy. The NIAID will coordinate the process of guidelines development through a 3-step process (outlined below). This process is analogous to that used by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to develop asthma guidelines through the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program. 

Step 1: Review of the scientific and clinical literature by an independent contractor that will perform a systematic review, evaluate, and grade the data.  This contractor will produce an interim and final evidence-based report summarizing the state-of-the-science.

Step 2: The NIAID will establish an Expert Panel that includes representatives from professional organizations, patient advocacy groups, NIH Institutes, and other government agencies that have a substantial interest in the care of individuals with food allergy.  The Panel will develop a draft of Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Food Allergy.  The Panelists will use both the evidence-based literature report and consensus expert opinion as the basis for developing draft guidelines. Draft guidelines will be made available for public review and comment prior to completing the final guidelines. It is anticipated that one or more contractors who produced the evidence-based report (step 1) will serve as consultants to the Expert Panel in an ad hoc capacity.

Step 3: The Expert Panel will develop the final set of guidelines based on its review of the draft guidelines, public comment, and endorsement by the participating organizations.  The final guidelines will then be disseminated to healthcare practitioners and the public via the NIAID and the participating organizations.

This RFI is seeking capability statements in order to identify individuals and/or organizations which can produce an independent high-quality systematic review and evidence-based report on definition, diagnosis and management of food allergy. Please submit a Statement of Capabilities, not to exceed 5 pages in length, including the following:

- Provide contractor's business size and type
- Demonstrate contractor's ability to fully meet the technical and personnel requirements outlined above
- Outline the approaches to systematic review and evidence grading that would be pertinent to this work
- Demonstrate contractor's ability to perform systematic reviews of the literature and to write high quality evidence-based reports
- Describe prior work by this contractor that was part of the process of development of clinical guidelines and/or similar work, and provide the dollar value of that work
- Describe prior timelines for completion of a systematic review, interim report, and a final report summarizing the state-of-the-science.
- Describe knowledge and expertise in food allergy, allergic diseases, or other diseases associated with food allergy

NO QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. This RFI is being used as a marketing research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources.

<SUBJECT>A--DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH SPEED, VARIABLE SPEED REFUEL DROGUE
<DESC>This 18 Jan 2008 Amendment changes the anticipated RFP release date from  "to be determined" to 18 Jan 2008.  The PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE was first  posted on 20 DECEMBER 2007, and titled DEVELOPMENT OF VARIABLE SPEED,  VARIABLE DRAG REFUELING DROGUE (VSD/VDD).  The 14 January 2008 Amendment  added the following information to the VSD/VDD Demonstration: For the  purposes of the VSD/VDD Demonstration, a Safety of Flight Certificate is  defined as a signed statement from the company based on the data presented  in the safety of flight package and when operated to the defined  limitations their drogue is safe for flight. VSD/VDD DEMONSTRATION Potential offerors have the option of participating in a demonstration of  their existing Variable Speed Drogue/Variable Drag Drogue (VSD/VDD)  candidate.  A potential offeror?s participation is strictly voluntary and  a decision not to participate will not adversely affect the government?s  future evaluation of any proposal. The demonstration will be used by the  government to assist in risk assessment. A potential offeror that decides  not to participate in the flight demonstration may still participate in  the resulting acquisition. All flight demonstrations will be performed on  a legacy MC-130E/P tanker with Sargent Fletcher Incorporated (SFI) 48-000-  2/4 refueling pods. Potential offerors who are contemplating participation  in the flight demonstration are asked to provide information as presented  below.  This information is necessary to make necessary arrangements at  the Government flight test facility.  Flight demonstration is expected to  take place during the week of 25 February 2008.  However, this is a  tentative date and is subject to change. A team from the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) 413 Flight  Test Squadron (FLTS) stationed at Hurlburt Field, Florida, will conduct  the flight testing.  The 413 FLTS will conduct the flight testing at the  Eglin Air Force Base/Hurlburt Field local area testing range. The offeror does not need to be present at the flight demo to have their  candidate drogue flown.  The offeror can elect to send the drogue and the  appropriate technical data to the locations provided.  If the offeror  elects to attend the flight demo, he/she will be provided a post-flight  test briefing of the results.  Following the fight test, a video and brief  summary of the flight test results will be provided to the offeror.  If  the offeror is not present, the video and brief report will be mailed to  the offeror along with return of the hardware provided for the demo. The  offeror will only be permitted to view the demonstration of their specific  drogue and any video recording will include only their drogue  demonstration and no other. The drogue will be flown in accordance with the offeror?s safety  restrictions and envelope which has been validated by wind tunnel testing  to be within the drag limits of the Sargent Fletcher pod.  A safety of  flight package consisting of, as a minimum, airspeed versus drag data,  flight limitations, verification of structural integrity and physical  interfaces shall be provided to the government.  The offerors will be  responsible for providing the necessary modification hardware to the  existing Sargent Fletcher pod with associated technical data.  The offeror  will provide any required checklists and a complete listing of the  configuration of the flight evaluation drogue and pod modifications.  The  government reserves the right to limit pod modifications based on  complexity of the modification.  No modifications shall be allowed that  will not allow the government to return the pod to the pre-modified  condition. 2.0  Offeror Requirements for Flight Testing The offeror shall: Submit to the government (see below address) by COB 24 January 2008 the  following documents:    	(a) 	Flight safety certificates 	(b)	Flight instructions and limitations 	(c)	Pod modification or maintenance instructions 	(d)  Physical dimensions of collapsed drogue including diameter and  length 	(e)	Address: 	ASC/668 AESS 	1895 5th Street, Building 46 	WPAFB, OH 45433-7200 	Attn: Mr. John Shock Submit to the government (see below address) 7 days prior to the scheduled  ground/flight evaluation the following: 	(a)	Drogues (include spare drogue(s) if desired) 	(b)	Visit request if representative is attending in person 	(c)	Address:	413th  Flight Test Squadron 	320 Tully Street 	Bldg 90343 	Hurlburt Field, FL 	Attn: Mr. Jim O?Brien At government request be prepared to participate in the government Safety  Review Board. 3.0  Government Support of Flight Evaluation The government will provide: 	(a)	C-130 equipped with Sargent Fletcher 48000- 02/04 pods 	(b)	Test pilot and crew 	(c)	MA-2/3 refueling coupling interface 	(d)	Chase aircraft and crew 	(e)	Video and photography equipment 	(f)	Safety Review Board 	(g)	A brief test report and video of results This is a change to the reference pre-solicitation notice.

An  Ombudsman has been established for this acquisition.  The only purpose of  the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate serious concerns potential  offerors may have when an offeror prefers not to use established channels  to communicate his/her concerns during the proposal development phase of  this acquisition.  Potential offerors should use established channels to  request information, pose questions, and voice concerns before resorting  to use of the Ombudsman.  Potential offerors are invited to contact ASC?s  Ombudsman, Mr. Craig Cassino, ASC/AE, 1755 Eleventh Street, Building 570,  Room 110, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-7404, DSN telephone number  785-5995, Commercial, 937-255-5995, with serious concerns only.

The proposed  contract action is for development for which the Government intends to  solicit and negotiate full and open competition under authority of FAR  Part 15.  There were no commercial terms and conditions that will be  utilized for this contract action.  There is no market information  available to determine a commercial market price for VSD/VDD.

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as numbered):

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the 
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 
1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}  When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of 
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.  
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NASA?s safety priority is to protect: (1) the public, (2) astronauts and pilots, (3) the NASA workforce (including contractor employees working on NASA contracts), and (4) high-value equipment and property.  (b) The Contractor shall take all reasonable safety and occupational health measures in performing this contract. The Contractor shall comply with all Federal, State, and local laws applicable to safety and occupational health and with the safety and occupational health standards, specifications, reporting requirements, and any other relevant requirements of this contract.  (c) The Contractor shall take, or cause to be taken, any other safety, and occupational health measures the Contracting Officer may reasonably direct. To the extent that the Contractor may be entitled to an equitable adjustment for those measures under the terms and conditions of this contract, the equitable adjustment shall be determined pursuant to the procedures of the changes clause of this contract; provided, that no adjustment shall be made under this Safety and Health clause for any change for which an equitable adjustment is expressly provided under any other clause of the contract.  (d) The Contractor shall immediately notify and promptly report to the Contracting Officer or a designee any accident, incident, or exposure resulting in fatality, lost-time occupational injury, occupational disease, contamination of property beyond any stated acceptable limits set forth in the contract Schedule; or property loss of $25,000 or more, or Close Call (a situation or occurrence with no injury, no damage or only minor damage (less than $1,000) but possesses the potential to cause any type mishap, or any injury, damage, or negative mission impact) that may be of immediate interest to NASA, arising out of work performed under this contract. The Contractor is not required to include in any report an expression of opinion as to the fault or negligence of any employee. In addition, service contractors (excluding construction contracts) shall provide quarterly reports specifying lost-time frequency rate, number of lost-time injuries, exposure, and accident/incident dollar losses as specified in the contract Schedule.  (e) The Contractor shall investigate all work-related incidents, accidents, and Close Calls, to the extent necessary to determine their causes and furnish the Contracting Officer a report, in such form as the Contracting Officer may require, of the investigative findings and proposed or completed corrective actions.  (f)(1) The Contracting Officer may notify the Contractor in writing of any noncompliance with this clause and specify corrective actions to be taken. When the Contracting Officer becomes aware of noncompliance that may pose a serious or imminent danger to safety and health of the public, astronauts and pilots, the NASA workforce (including contractor employees working on NASA contracts), or high value mission critical equipment or property, the Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor orally, with written confirmation. The Contractor shall promptly take and report any necessary corrective action.

(g) The Contractor (or subcontractor or supplier) shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (g) and any applicable Schedule provisions and clauses, with appropriate changes of designations of the parties, in all solicitations and subcontracts of every tier, when one or more of the following conditions exist:  (1) The work will be conducted completely or partly on premises owned or controlled by the Government.  (2) The work includes construction, alteration, or repair of facilities in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold.  (3) The work, regardless of place of performance, involves hazards that could endanger the public, astronauts and pilots, the NASA workforce (including Contractor employees working on NASA contracts), or high value equipment or property, and the hazards are not adequately addressed by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations (if applicable).  (4) When the Contractor (or subcontractor or supplier) determines that the assessed risk and consequences of a failure to properly manage and control the hazard(s) warrants use of the clause.  (h) The Contractor (or subcontractor or supplier) may exclude the provisions of paragraph (g) from its solicitation(s) and subcontract(s) of every tier when it determines that the clause is not necessary because the application of the OSHA and DOT (if applicable) regulations constitute adequate safety and occupational health protection. When a determination is made to exclude the provisions of paragraph (g) from a solicitation and subcontract, the Contractor must notify and provide the basis for the determination to the Contracting Officer. In subcontracts of every tier above the micro-purchase threshold for which paragraph (g) does not apply, the Contractor (or subcontractor or supplier) shall insert the substance of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (f) of this clause).

A)  To activate the water sprayer from the truck so one does not have to get in-out to turn on the water while spraying down the roads. This is just an add on that makes it safer and easier on one person doing the dust control on roads.  2. Q) What is the purpose of the dual spray heads? A)  It can be one I guess as long as it sprays 30ft wide to cover the entire road in one pass. Most I talked to thought theirs sprayed 15 ft per head so it would take 2 heads to cover one 30ft road.  3. Q)  Are the hoses like a canon hose on a fire truck or something one person can hold and spray in terms of power? A)  The fire hose attachment was to get all the hoses listed below for self loading of the tank from a standing water supply and to wash down equipment on the yard with more.  4. Horsepower.  Using the formulas for determining horse power requirements, we calculate that a 10 horse power gas engine is required to pump 140 GPM @ 52 PSI.  Please advise what the correct specification should be. Please submit your quote based on your companies recommended formula for required horsepower for a gas engine pump based on the following specs: 140 GPM @ 52 PSI.  5.  Q) When it says ý30 foot wide spray capabilityý, does this mean 15 foot from either side of the center line of the trailer?  A)  On the 30 ft wide spray, it can be 15 ft from center line of trailer each way for a total of 30 ft of coverage.<BR><BR>Attachment with descriptions and pictures.<BR><BR>All Vendor questions must be received in writing by 400PM EST on Wednesday January 23rd 2008<BR><BR>

Responses to Space Flight Awareness (SFA) Questions: Question 1:  Has the SFA NASA procurement been awarded?  Have had a few hoteliers contact me to question if the procurement has been awarded to a third party?  We are all a little confused, as a few third parties have contacted us informing us that they are representing this program. Answer 1:  Solicitation NNJ08231499Q has not been awarded, and will not be awarded until after the bid deadline in the text of the Solicitation.  While third parties are welcome to submit an offer in response to this Solicitation, we have not awarded the contract to a third party nor are any third parties representing NASA in relation to this solicitation.  Please forward all questions related to this solicitation to the JSC procurement points of contact, Kirby Condron and Jessica Miller. Question 2:  I have a question about the Standard Form 1449.  Do we need to use this as it seems like this is the order that would come back from NASA? Answer 2:  Standard Form 1449 is found in the text of the Solicitation in the following paragraph:  Offerors are encouraged to use the Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Items form found at URL: http://server-mpo.arc.nasa.gov/Services/NEFS/NEFSHome.tml    After review of the data we are requiring with your response we have removed the requirement for submission of a SF 1449 with your offer. Question 3:  In the paragraph beginning with the NAICS Code, I am to state my "size status".  What is this? Answer 3:  The Solicitation states the following, ?The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 721110 and $6.5M, respectively. The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement.? To calculate your firm?s SBA size standard based on your annual average receipts and average employment, please refer to 13 CFR 121.104 and 121.106. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on December 21, 2007.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND A SEPARATE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 under Simplified Acquisition procedures in Subpart 13.5 as supplemental with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is RFP101188 and is being issued as a Request for Proposal.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-18.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561990. The purpose of this Contract is to engage the services of a contractor to support the Clinical Center Patient representative. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (CC) is a clinical research hospital providing all medical services for patients participating in human research protocols of the NIH. The CC provides patient facilities and services for clinical investigations by the NIH Institutes, research in related areas and supervises residency and other training programs. 

?Professional Services Contract Statement of Work?

The contractor will serve as assistant to the Clinical Center Patient Representative (PR). He/ she will be responsible for contacting patients and family members as assigned, who are seeking assistance from the PR office. He/ she will work closely with the PR to insure a seamless response to expressed concerns and a coordinated approach to hospital staff, administrators, Institute staff and others needed to resolve the problems. He/ she will investigate patient/ family complaints and develop a plan of action in concert with the PR. Effective communication with staff at all levels of the organization ? administrators, clinical research staff, and Institute staff ? as well as clinicians and many others outside the hospital will make successful resolution possible.

The contractor, working with the PR, will be involved in the continued development of systematic data management that maintains the confidentiality of patients, while meeting the needs of the organization in a more comprehensive, consistent, and apparent manner.  

The contractor will help the PR to develop a systematic pro-active approach to patients and families in the outpatient clinics. Currently, inpatients are contacted routinely and made aware of the PR program, and there are numerous professional staff available to them on the patient-care unit. The outpatients are not given this same support. Their contact with staff is considerably less and often they are faced with complex problems to handle on their own. 

The contractor will contact patients and families, assigned by the PR, in follow-up to determine the outcome of intervention by the PR office. He/ she will be responsible for helping the PR to develop a system for responding to whatever needs remain unmet and maintaining contact with the individual(s) until a more complete resolution of the problem or concern occurs. 

With the increase in requests to the PR office for consent-monitoring, the contractor will work with clinical research teams as assigned, and provide consent-monitoring when appropriate from a patient-advocacy point of view. Together, the PR and the contractor will determine the most appropriate situations for providing this service. Communication about these cases with both the Clinical Bioethics Department and the NIMH Psychiatric Consult Service will continue in an ongoing way to provide the optimal service to patients and families.

The contractor will help the PR to evaluate the PR volunteer program and to assess its changing needs and focus. He/ she will help to re-direct and re-train current volunteers as appropriate and necessary.

Working closely with the PR, the contractor will review very complex cases, will help to determine the best approach to handle them and will participate in evaluation of the outcome. 

Using professional skills and experience, the contractor will work with the PR to identify areas within the NIH clinical research program for enhancing patient advocacy. Both will work together to describe this model of patient advocacy within a clinical research setting with presentations in appropriate settings and in written materials to be submitted for publication in professional journals.
