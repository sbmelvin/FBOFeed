<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Defense Manufacturing Company, Melbourne, FL.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Redstone Technical Test Center.  The Redstone Technical Test Center has a requirement to obtain one Infrared Imaging System.  The system has an operational wavelength of 3-5 microns, spatial resolution of 320x240 imaging pixels, dual range focal length of 50mm and 250mm with Germanium optics anti-reflection coating, a dual field of view 11.0 deg x 8.2 deg and 2.2 deg x 1.65 deg, a dual control system interface electronics box and GUI via laptop computer with RS-232 interface, the length is less than 16 in and the weight is less than nine pounds.  This infrared imager will be integrated onto an existing RTTC optical tracking system and used to track hyper-velocity missile systems to provide event and angular position data during missile flight test.  The output signal of the imager will provide an input for an automatic video tracker that provides error signals to drive the tracking system.  The imager must meet size and weight specifications so mount payload limits will not be exceeded.  The imager must have sufficient spatial resolution to provide detailed imagery of missile event data.  The focal length of the imager must be such that the longer field of view provides sufficient optical magnification at long target ranges to resolve missile event data during flight.  The angular field of view in the longer focal length setting shall be no greater than 2.5 degrees horizontal x 1.75 degrees vertical.  The imager must have a dual mode focus system including a manual focus system and an automatic motorized focus system.  It must be sensitive in the 3-5 micron region of the spectrum, and weigh less than ten pounds to meet payload restrictions and be less than 20 in long.  The imager must be environmentally sealed to resist dust and moisture, have an anti-reflection coating on the front optical element.  The system must have two modes of control, one via a quick adjust interface control box to control focus and field of view settings, and the second control interface must be via a laptop computer so more specific responses of the imager can be controlled, i.e. brightness, contrast, filtering, FOV, focus and pseudo-color temperature threshold.  Extensive market research indicates that the Range Pro 50/250 is the only system that will meet interface requirements with the RTTC optical tracking equipment and is compatible with existing data processing equipment.  To use another vendor's product would require substantial modification to the existing optical tracking mount which is estimated to cost $75,000.  Defense Manufacturing Company is the only known vendor that has the knowledge and expertise to integrate the existing Octec Video Tracker with the required flir in the timeframe required to conduct scheduled test events.  Award to any other source would require an inordinate amount of time to familiarize the vendor with the existing equipment which would result in an unacceptable impact to planned test schedules.  RTTC has determined that the equipment required is available from only one responsible source and no other type of equipment will satisfy agency requirements. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST December 6, 2004 will be considered by the Government.  POC:  Will Galvin, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions must be emailed  to Will Galvin at William.galvin@mms.gov.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Precision Analog Systems, Plantation, FL.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Redstone Technical Test Center.  The Redstone Technical Test Center has a requirement to obtain four Precision Analog Input Cards, two Mdl PAS 9723 and two Mdl PAS 9716.  This semi-active laser projection system will be integrated in the Advanced Multispectral Simulation, Test and Acceptance Resource (AMSTAR).  The complete system will provide complex multi-channel semi-active laser scenes to a semi-active laser seeker in real time as a simulated missile flight is flown.  The system is a complex 3 channel dynamic precision system custom developed by Optical Science Coordination under the direction of Redstone Technical Test Center.  The first copy of this system has been built and is being installed in the first AMSTAR test facility (performance bay 1).  This order is for parts that make up the second system to be installed in the second AMSTAR test facility (production bay 1).  It is the goal of the AMSTAR development team to directly duplicate systems from the first facility into the second.  This provides reduced development time, compatibility between systems, test duplication, easier configuration control and a reduced spare requirement.  Precision Analog Systems makes these two cards in house and only direct sales from the company are possible.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of development, documentation, engineering, and spare cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Therefore, due to time, compatibility, and related cost issues, no other vendor other than Precision Analog Systems meets the requirements.  RTTC has determined that the equipment required is available from only one responsible source and no other type of equipment will satisfy agency requirements. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST December 6, 2004 will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) is seeking proposals from qualified organizations that have the ability to accrue a specified number of study subjects for Phase I clinical trials and clinical pharmacology studies.

<DESC>General Statistical Support (PR-CI-04-10848)

The U.S. EPA Office of Water is actively seeking a contractor to provide General Statistical Support Services.  This requirement was originally synopsized on FedBizOps as RFP PR-CI-03-10770, which was cancelled on June 16, 2004, due to a change in the Agency’s requirements.  A new solicitation, reflecting these changes, was issued as RFP PR-CI-04-10848, and during the review process for this procurement an administrative oversight was discovered.  The cancellation notice for PR-CI-03-10770, and the synopsis for RFP PR-CI-04-10848 were both posted to the U.S. EPA OAM Cincinnati website, but not through the Government Point of Entry (GPE) FedBizOps, as required by FAR 5.204.  The RFP for this requirement is currently posted on the U.S. EPA OAM Cincinnati website, and prospective offerors will have a total of 45 days to submit their proposals (includes a 15 day Synopsis Period, and a 30 day period to submit proposals).  RFP PR-CI-04-10848 has been updated to reflect a new required date for submissions of proposals, and new anticipated period of performance dates.  No other changes have been made to PR-CI-04-10848. Proposals are due January 14, 2005.

This requirement replaces solicitation number PR-CI-03-10770, which was cancelled on June 16, 2004.  The cancellation was posted to the U.S. EPA OAM Cincinnati website.

This procurement will be processed using full and open competition and FAR Part 15. The proposed contract will be a cost-plus-fixed-fee, level-of-effort, term type contract, with a base period of one year and four one-year option periods, totaling 60 months. The base-level-of-effort (LOE) for each of the five periods will be approximately 1,500 direct labor hours, with options for additional LOE of up to 18,500 direct labor hours in each period, for a total potential 100,000 direct productive labor hours over the five years, if all options are exercised. ALL RESPONSIBLE SOURCES MAY SUBMIT AN OFFER, WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE AGENCY.

<ARCHDATE>01142005
<CONTACT>JOSHUA M. BOWERS, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513-487-2104, E-Mail: BOWERS.JOSHUA@EPA.GOV
<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate for the National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL), located in Cincinnati, OH, on a sole source basis with the VTI Corporation, of Hialeah, FL, under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 to provide a Vapor Sorption System. This system is a device that generates a solvent vapor, accurately and precisely monitors the mass of a material as it absorbs the vapors, controls the pressure of the vapor, controls the temperature of the sample, records the data, and automatically controls operating variables via a computer data acquisition and control unit. The exact specifications of the system are as follows: 1. Balance shall be a magnetic suspension balance in order to isolate balance mechanism and electronics from vapors in sample chamber.  In addition, sample chamber shall be compatible with vapors of organic acids such as acetic acid. 2. Balance shall have a resolution of 1 microgram or better and a maximum reproducibility error of 4 micrograms. 3. Balance shall accept a sample load of at least 1 gram while delivering the resolution and reproducibility identified in specification 2. 4. Sample chamber shall be temperature controlled with a minimum upper temperature of 300 ?C.  Temperature control shall be ?0.05 ?C in the temperature range of 20 to 80 ?C. 5. Temperature control shall allow for rapid sample quenching (minimum 10 ?C/min). 6. Temperature control and pressure control shall be programmable and preprogrammed experimental sequences shall be possible.  Control of the apparatus and acquisition of data will be carried out using a computer-based hardware/software system.  Computer shall be Windows?-based with sufficient hard disk capacity, memory, and performance to operate the system software.  Computer unit shall be equipped with a read-write CD drive and a 17" LCD monitor. 7. High vacuum system is required to degas samples with an ultimate vacuum of at most 10-4 mbar (absolute pressure). 8. System shall be capable of monitoring pressure in the sample chamber over a range from 10-4 to 1000 mbar.  Accuracy shall be better than 0.2% over the range of 0.1 to 400 torr absolute pressure with a resolution of 0.01 torr over that same range. 9. Vapor shall be introduced into the evacuated sample chamber from a liquid source.  Introduction of vapor is automatically controlled by the computer-based control unit.   10. System shall be equipped with the hardware and software necessary to perform a series of experiments with preprogrammed operating parameters without operator intervention  11.  All components of the system containing vapor shall be thermostated at a temperature of at least 70 ?C to avoid vapor condensation. 12. The leak rate of room air into an evacuated system (at less than 1 torr) shall be less than 0.1 torr per day. 13. Installation and familiarization for five users in Cincinnati, OH.  This notice is not a request for quotations.  EPA source research indicates the VTI Corporation is the only known contractor capable of providing this instrument. Due to the hazardous and aggressive nature of the solvent vapors to be studied with the subject Vapor Sorption System, only certain materials of construction can be used inside the vapor sorption cell.  In addition, the government's requirements include study of sorption at high temperatures (up to 80?C) and at high vapor concentrations.  The only type of device that is capable of meeting the government's requirements is a magnetic suspension balance in which the balance mechanism is physically isolated from the sample and vapors.  The only known manufacturer of this type of balance is Rubotherm Prazisionsmesstechnik GMBH.   Several known companies are distributors of Rubotherm balances and are capable of building vapor sorption systems with the Rubotherm magnetic suspension balance.  However, only VTI Corporation manufactures commercial vapor sorption systems with Rubotherm balances which fully meet the government's requirements.  Specifically, only a sorption system from VTI Corp. is equipped with a water-cooled electric furnace as well as equipped with the hardware and software necessary to perform a series of experiments with preprogrammed operating parameters without operator intervention ("stacking" of experiments).  Rapid sample cooling and preprogrammed experimental sequences are required by the government.  The only known commercially available Vapor Sorption System which meets the government's requirements is manufactured by the VTI Corporation.   However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of completing such a project. Such documentation shall be submitted by 1:00 PM EST, Wednesday December 15, 2004. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order  based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. The applicable NAICS code is 334516. Interested parties should submit their technical documentation to Mr. Josh Bowers, using the following methods: by fax to 513.487.2109, or by email (bowers.joshua@epa.gov) referencing solicitation PR-CI-05-10164.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Ms. Livita Kretkovskiene, Chief Specialist of the Water Transport Department, Ministry of Transport and Communications, Gedimino Avenue 17, LT-2679 Vilnius, Lithuania; Phone: +370-5-393-984; Fax: +370-5-393-880; E-mail: l.kretkovskiene@transp.lt.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance on a security project at the Port of Klaipeda in Lithuania

The Port of Klaipeda consists of more than 1000 acres and 150 designated ship berths and is administered by the state-owned Klaipeda State Seaport Authority.  In 2003, the port handled more than 20 million tons of cargo, an increase of 8% over the year before and 25% over 1998.  The primary growth has been in containerized and especially roll-on roll-off (Ro-Ro) cargo.  The Port has made numerous recent improvements, particularly new breakwaters, channel dredging, and new oil-handling facilities.  The Port is planning a substantial expansion of its container-handling capacity.

As part of recent development of the Port, closed-circuit television surveillance was installed in 22 locations with a central monitoring.  However, more security improvements are needed for the Port to be in compliance with the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) International Ship and Port Facility Security Code.  The IMO governs standards for maritime shipping and ports. The Border Control Point in Malku Bay where there are two container terminals will need security equipment and to be integrated with Lithuanian Customs.  For example, new x-ray facilities are needed to scan containers.

A major portion of the security upgrade will involve expanding information technology (IT) systems related to security.  The existing Vessel Traffic System, which monitors the location and identity of ships in the Port and nearby channels, is already being updated as part of another feasibility study, but will need to be integrated into new security systems.  Also, the Port’s IT system will be upgraded to allow for the electronic transfer of cargo movement information, customs documentation, and other European Union traffic control data.  The integrity of the Port’s internal network will be improved through enhanced computer firewalls and safeguards.  

Finally, physical security at the port will be enhanced through the training of Port, Ministry and terminal security officers.  They will learn risk assessment, the essential components of facility security plans and the selection and operation of security-related equipment (e.g. x-ray equipment).  

The technical assistance will review the current security arrangement, will look at future security needs in light of the port container expansion and will help to train facility security officers and other personnel.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $415,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures a firm fixed price award to the Interindustry Economic Research Fund, Inc., P.O. Box 451, College Park, Maryland  20740 for a subscription to LIFT 2080 and a LIFT software license.  Inforum-LIFT is uniquely qualified for three reasons: (1) Through previous work under contract to CMS, the LIFT model has been modified to specifically address OACT requirements.  These modifications include those required to develop long term (75+ year) projections.  The capability to analyze detailed industry behavior over the long term is a capability unique to LIFT. (2) In addition, the LIFT framework permits the user to replace LIFT equations with user specified equations and/or override the models equations or exogenous assumptions.  CMS have already invested considerable time in learning how to use this capability.  Again, this feature (that is, the ability for the user to override the model equations in the context of a long term projection tool) is a feature that is unique to LIFT.
(3) Inforum economists have worked closely with CMS staff for several years on various long term forecasting projects.  As a result, Inforum economists have a detailed knowledge of CMS programs and projects which would be difficult if not impossible to replace.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Situational awareness is improved because ENVGs infrared sensor provides the Soldier with the capability to rapidly detect and recognize man-sized targets while maintaining  the ability to see detail with the image intensifier sensor.  The image intensifier allows ENVG to be compatible with rifle-mounted aiming lights. Request:  The U.S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center intends to issue Request for Proposal W91CRB-05-R-0006 on or about 14 December 2004 for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) ENVG assets, spare components, development of supporting logistics and techn ical documentation, performance of a Logistics Demonstration (LD) and execution of Developmental Testing (DT) and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E).

<CONTACT>Bob Prior, Contracting Officer, Phone (202)366-4247, Fax (202)366-3705, Email Bob.Prior@fhwa.dot.gov
<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration has a need to contract for legal advisory services for the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. Pursuant to the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 (TIFIA), Title I, Subtitle E, Chapter 1 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), Public Law 105-178 (23 U.S.C. 181-189), the Department of Transportation (DOT) is authorized to provide credit assistance to major surface transportation projects including secured (direct) loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit to borrowers for major surface transportation projects and for up to 33% of eligible project costs.  Projects may include highway, transit, passenger rail and intermodal facilities.  Generally, under current law, project costs must equal or exceed $100 million. 

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), on behalf of DOT, seeks to award several legal counsel advisory task order contracts to law firms with municipal bond and private lender expertise, including project finance experience, (with renewal options to be exercised at the sole discretion of the DOT) to provide advice and assistance to the TIFIA Joint Program Office (JPO) and Departmental operating agency counsel in reviewing, drafting, negotiating and modifying credit instruments including:  term sheets, as well as secured (direct) loan agreements, guaranteed loan agreements, line of credit agreements, and related documents including, lease agreements, pledge documents,  bond indentures, hedge agreements and swap termination documents as well as intercreditor agreements to be entered into between the DOT and selected TIFIA borrowers and third parties as appropriate.  Counsel may also review, draft, and modify amendments or amended and restated agreements. The contract will be for an initial two-year period with three (3) one-year renewal options.

 The firms selected will: provide advice and counsel to the DOT in analyzing the legal aspects of the financing for the project; review and modify as appropriate opinion letters of borrowers’ counsel; and ensure that credit agreement terms, conditions, covenants, and remedies provide adequate security to the DOT, are appropriate for the particular transaction, and are consistent with the statutory criteria and the regulations implementing the TIFIA program. The firm will also review all loan closing documentation and be responsible for or represent as appropriate the TIFIA JPO at financial close (generally held simultaneously with senior creditors) and may from time to time be required to furnish legal memoranda which would be incorporated into a briefing memoranda making recommendations with regard to the execution of the TIFIA credit agreement by the Department.

The firm must be able to attend working conferences and meetings at DOT headquarters in Washington, D.C. on short notice as well as participate in telephone conference calls on short notice.

It is anticipated that each law firm will be assigned one to three projects (task orders) annually, depending upon the number of TIFIA applications.  For each project/task order, the DOT will select one firm from among the multiple firms it retains to advise it on each transaction.


Extensive information on the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) can be accessed through the website http://www.tifia.fhwa.dot.gov/

The solicitation and all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site at http://www1.eps.gov/spg/DOT/FHWA/postdate_1.html which will list all the FHWA business opportunities sorted by posted date.

In addition, the document  sections, most notably, the PCO letters, are out of order due to software  glitches. //END OF UPDATE// UPDATE (11-05-04) SECTION L AND M, CLINs and SECTION H POSTED All interested parties are asked to review the Sections L, M, and H and the  CLINs and provide questions and comments to the contractual POC listed below at  your earliest convenience but NLT 3:00 pm EST on 11 Nov 2004.  If you have any  additional questions regarding the upcoming RFP release, please direct them to  the contractual POC listed below.

As  part of the internal review process for RFP+s, it has become evident that it is  in the best interest of both the Government and the offerors to change the  pricing structure of the contract to 5 years FFP and 5 years FP/EPA.  The  current constraints on NTE options would negatively impact both the flexibility  of the contract and the level of confidence in the out years.   If you have any questions or comments, please contact the contractual POC  listed below. Contractual POC: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //End of Update// UPDATE (10-14-2004) AC vs. DC Seat Actuator on T-38 ESUP The purpose of this announcement is to provide information regarding a question  about seat actuators from the recent Industry Day.  Because this information  could have a significant impact on potential solutions, it is being released  prior to the posting of the other questions and answers.   Changing from Alternating Current to Direct Current Seat Actuators for the T- 38C ESUP  This question was forwarded to OO-ALC/LCEA for their review and comment.  They  recommend we do not use DC actuators if at all possible.  The DC load is taxed  with the AUP upgrade and other changes are pending to add further loads to the  DC buss.  The change to DC would also require an aircraft rewire to add a  circuit breaker and cabling.  It would be less of an impact to use AC actuators  and a much simpler modification to the aircraft.  The present AC system has 5  amp circuit breakers.  If at one half the capacity of the 5 amp breaker (2.5  amps,) 2.5 X 115 volts=287.5 VA.  With DC of 28 volts equals 10 amps current  draw.  Conservatively, this is approximately one fifth the battery capacity.   Operation of both seats at the same time would further impact the battery  drain.  The battery is rated for 15 minutes of aircraft operation in an  emergency situation.  Taxing of the battery capability in anyway is not  desirable. If you have any questions, please contact the contractual POC below.

Please respond to these questions at your earliest convenience but NLT 3:00 pm  EST on 8 Oct 2004.  If you have any questions or concerns please contact the  contractual POC listed below.

The above items can be made available upon written request and demonstrated  interest in this program.  However, these items are available on a non- interference basis and access is by appointment only.  Please note that a visit  to Randolph AFB and Moody AFB will be required.     If your company is interested in arranging a time to visit these items and you  plan to respond to the T-38C ESUP RFP, please contact the contractual POC  listed below at your earliest convenience but no later than 12:00 pm EST on 4  Oct 2004.  Further instructions will be provided upon receipt of your request. RFP SCHEDULE UPDATE The second draft RFP will be released in sections between now and 22 Oct 2004.   As these sections are released, please review and provide comments within 3  business days.  The Final RFP is currently planned to be released on 10  November 2004.  Offeror responses to the Past Performance section will be  required approximately one month after RFP release.  Written proposals,  representative seat and associated hardware for installation and measurement in  the T-38C forebody will be required approximately two months after RFP release.

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment 01 to SN05-10 is to provide additional information and amplification regarding the functional technologies that DARPA is interested in pursuing.  This information is provided to assist potential teaming partners and interested subcontractors in evaluating those specific system technologies that may fall under those component technologies (i.e. Tool-Making-Took Kit, Software Confederation Web, and Interaction Manager) previously mentioned.  The following is applicable:

The primary functional objective of the IBC program is to provide three capabilities:

1.	A set of visualization and human-computer interaction tools that enable command center personnel to interact with existing information sources, portray and understand complex information, and interact with automated decision aids.
2.	A capability to predict and analyze political, military, economic, social, information or infrastructure (PMESII) effects that could be caused by diplomatic, military, information operation or economic (DIME) actions. 
3.	A capability to develop effects-based plans (and an Effects Tasking Order).

For the second capability (action-effect prediction and analysis), the desired approach is to exploit existing technologies to model the various PMESII systems, but add a capability for these models to interact in order to generate the distribution of actions that can cause an effect and vice versa.  We are not interested in developing new fundamental modeling technologies for PMESII systems, but rather developing the technology to cause various existing models to interact.

It is desired that the PMESII models and the planning tools be implemented so that they can be modified with new or changed substantive knowledge and behaviors by command center personnel, on-the-fly, via the visualization and computer interaction tools to be developed.

DARPA envisions that the program would be conducted by one or more teams of contractors. The lead contractor should have the capability to deliver the software tools and demonstrate their knowledge bases in a classified environment.

The program will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will result in a basal capability for action-effect prediction and analysis, and the visualization and computer-interaction tools. Phase 2 would develop effects-based planning tools and enhance the other tools developed in Phase 1.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Office of Procurement Laguna, is conducting a Sources Sought Synopsis for information purposes only. This is not a solicitation announcement and this notice does not constitute any commitment by the Government. The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources. Responses to this Sources Sought Synopsis will be used by the government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. The Office of Procurement Laguna has a future requirement to provide secure detention services to operate and manage the government owned/contractor operated Migrant Operations Center (MOC) located on the United States Naval Air Station (USNAS), Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (GTMO). The MOC is a facility at which undocumented aliens seeking to enter the United States who are interdicted at sea or otherwise encountered in the Caribbean region are provided custody, care, safety, transportation and other needs pending a determination of immigrant status and transfer. The contractor will be required to furnish all personnel, management, equipment, supplies and services necessary for performance of all aspects of the contract requirement. The MOC has permanent structures with a base operational capacity of approximately 130 migrants with additional capacity via temporary structures for approximately 400 additional migrants in the event of a sudden surge in the migrant population. The contractor will assume primary responsibility for migrant care from the time custody is transferred, after arrival, until the migrant is repatriated or resettled. The population includes single males, females, and families of various nationalities and security levels.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561612 (Size Standard: $10.5 million).

GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Redstone Technical Test Center.  The Redstone Technical Test Center has a requirement to obtain Performance Bay Wire Assemblies.  This millimeter wave (MMW) Radar projection system will be integrated in the Advanced Multispectral Simulation, Test and Acceptance Resource (AMSTAR).  The complete system will provide complex multi-channel MMW scenes to a MMW radar seeker in real time as a simulated missile flight is flown.  The first copy of this system has already been built and is being installed in the first AMSTAR test facility (performance bay 1).  This order is for parts that make up the second system to be installed in the second AMSTAR test facility (production bay 1).  It is the goal of the AMSTAR development team to directly duplicate systems from the first facility into the second.  This will provide reduced development time, compatibility between systems, test duplication, easier configuration control and a reduced spare requirement.  Insulated Wire Inc. makes these parts in house and only direct sales from the company are possible.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of development, documentation, engineering, and spare costs to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Therefore, due to time, compatibility, and related cost issues, no other vendor other than Insulated Wire Inc. meets the requirements.  RTTC has determined that the equipment required is available from only one responsible source and no other type of equipment will satisfy agency requirements.

<SUBJECT>99--"One Mid Wave and one Long Wave IMSS Lens Systems"
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Pacific Advanced Technology, Buelton, CA.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Redstone Technical Test Center.  The Redstone Technical Test Center has a requirement to obtain one Mid Wave IMSS Lens System and one Long Wave IMSS Lens System.  The Field Signature Group (FSG) currently has a Raytheon HS Midwave Infrared (MWIR) radiometric camera and a Raytheon Radiance 1 (LWIR) QWIP radiometric camera.  The Image Multi-spectral Sensing (IMSS) systems from Pacific Advance Technology (PAT) are COTS systems that can be integrated directly with the cameras depending on the wavelength.  Both systems integrate a controller, frame grabber, software and all cables for a turn key solution.  The FSG of RTTC utilizes radiometric cameras in support of missile systems for building 3D models, Delta-T measurements and airborne data collections.  To increase the Raytheon HS MWIR and Raytheon Radiance 1 LWIR capability and extend their useful life, a multi-spectral acquisition system is to be added to each camera.  This will enhance its current usefulness to include spectral characterization of smoke, missile fumes, gas clouds, target exhaust, etc.  The MWIR IMSS system has a nominal spectral resolution of 0.01µm (at 4.0µm) with over 200 spectral bins between 3-5µm.  The LWIR IMSS system also has a nominal spectral resolution of 0.01µm (at 9.0µm) between 8-11µm.  It utilizes a single optical element to handle both dispersion and diffraction.  This simplifies the system design allowing it to be compact and portable.  This aspect is imperative for field testing.  It can also dwell on a single wavelength bin to collect specific wavelengths of interest.  The required lens system must be 100 percent compatible with existing laboratory equipment.  To compete this action and award to another vendor would result in loss of compatibility.  It would also represent the loss of existing detailed measuring machine knowledge translating into a decrease in efficiency. Award to a vendor other than Pacific Advanced Technology would result in substantial duplication of cost that the Government is not expected to recover through open competition. Therefore, due to time, compatibility, and related cost issues, no other vendor other than Pacific Advanced Technology meets the requirements.  RTTC has determined that the equipment required is available from only one responsible source and no other type of equipment will satisfy agency requirements. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST December 6, 2004 will be considered by the Government.

<SUBJECT>69 --  V-22 Curriculum Development
<DESC>Naval Air Orlando Training Systems Division (NAVAIR Orlando TSD) has a requirement to provide contractor non-personal technical support services for the design and development of curricula for all USMC Type/Model/Series aviation training systems and training organizations (FRS, ATS, MAWTS-1, etc). These curricula will establish the requirements for courseware and training systems, which will be procured competitively under TSC II. This requirement is being solicited as a sole source procurement action to Aviation Training Consulting (ATC), Inc.  NAVAIR Orlando TSD anticipates awarding an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with firm-fixed price delivery orders.  The period of performance is thirty-six months.  The maximum budget for this effort is $28,000,000.

The contractor will provide the Government curricula in the format necessary to facilitate the Marine Corps goal of achieving a concurrency management process.  ATC has completed the 100 level curriculum for the USMC MV-22 Program.  The curriculum format is unique, as well as the process of using a comprehensive master task list in its development. The primary purpose for developing common curricula is to enable the use of a Training Concurrency Integration (TCI) process for the Marine Corps.  ATC is currently under contract with PMA-275 to develop the TCI process.  In order to insure that the subject curricula is properly formatted and compatible with the final TCI process, and to ensure that curricula content re-use is maximized where possible, it is in the best interest of the government to contract for all required Marine Aviation curricula with ATC until the TCI process and tools are completed by ATC and delivered to the government.

This synopsis is for information and subcontract planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing the information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.

<SUBJECT>99--DIGITAL TELEVISION TRANSITION IN SUPPORT OF NASA
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. Digital Television (SDTV) transition in support of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  Background and Purpose:  The President’s Commission on Implementation of U.S. Space Exploration Policy forwarded its report, “A Journey to Inspire, Innovate, and Discover” to the President on June 4, 2004. In that report, the Commission made a number of recommendations concerning the importance of engaging the public. The full commission report is available on the Internet at http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/60736main_M2M_report_small.pdf .  Finding 8 states: "The Commission finds that the space exploration vision offers an extraordinary opportunity to stimulate mathematics, science, and engineering excellence for America's students and teachers – and to engage the public in a journey that will shape the course of human destiny."  A powerful resource that can be used to inform, educate and possibly even inspire the American public is NASA Television.  NASA TV was created with the Space Shuttle program and was launched with STS-1 in 1981 to provide media and public access to video of mission operations. Using existing satellites that were a part of the Space Shuttle program's communication network, NASA created the television service.  Before the Space Shuttle, major television networks and news services contributed resources to provide access to video of NASA missions. This cooperative arrangement ended with the Apollo program, but the creation of NASA Television was seen as a way to both support human spaceflight activities and provide easy public access to video and other media information.  Until 1986, the satellite transponder was used solely to support human space flight operations. However, after the Challenger tragedy NASA expanded use of the satellite transponder for additional programming that included press conferences, video-on-demand feeds for electronic news organizations, education programming and internal communications between Headquarters and the agency's 10 field centers.  NASA TV is a wholesaler, providing raw material and programming to be repurposed by other retail broadcasters and learning institutions. NASA TV is currently not engineered for general public viewing.  Subscriptions services that carry the analog NASA TV satellite signal do so as a public service. Since the analog system is not encrypted – or scrambled to contemporary broadcast standards – anyone with basic C-Band satellite downlink equipment can receive programming.  In its recommendation for public engagement, the Commission said NASA needed to employ "new, and even novel means for communicating with the public about space."  In an effort to meet the Commission's recommendation, NASA will upgrade the satellite infrastructure that supports the audio and video feeds from the older analog format to Standard Digital Television (SDTV) within the next six months. The transition will allow the Agency to expand services from one analog channel to multiple digital channels, while using the same single satellite transponder.  This digital transition is not a new development for the broadcast industry. Most private and public broadcasters already distribute their programming by digital satellite transmission. However, digital broadcasting is new to NASA and will require a transition period to ensure there is no disruption of service to NASA's internal and external audiences.  The additional digital channels also offer NASA the opportunity to explore partnerships and programming options currently not available as part of the older analog infrastructure.  As NASA moves forward with upgrading the broadcasting infrastructure, the Agency wants to make the best use of the additional resources provided by migrating to multiple digital signals. As a result, NASA has issued this Request for Information (RFI).  This RFI seeks any and all ideas for new and innovative ways to utilize the new digital infrastructure to better communicate NASA's ongoing missions of exploration and discovery to a variety of internal and external audiences.  Questions concerning this RFI may be submitted via email no later than December 14, 2004 to Mr. Robert N. Jacobs rjacobs@mail.hq.nasa.gov. Responses to this RFI should be sent to the address shown below. Responses are due January 15, 2005. Respondents shall provide an electronic submission to rjacobs@mail.hq.nasa.gov in addition  to the hardcopy submission. Responses are limited to 20 pages. An executive summary should be included as part of any response greater than 10 pages.   Mr. Robert N. Jacobs  Director, News and Multimedia  NASA Headquarters  300 E Street SW  Washington, D.C. 20546  This document is for information and planning purposes. This document is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response. Respondents will not be notified of the results.

Of particular interest are agents useful in diagnosis or treatment of multiple tumors in different organs in patients with von Hippel-Landau (VHL) disease, sporadic kidney tumors and kidney tumors in dialysis patients.  NINDS is seeking a development and commercialization partner for identification of agents that act as antagonist to EPO, especially ligands that bind EPOR but do not activate the receptor.

Potential Areas of Application
·	Treatment and diagnosis of multiple tumors in different organs in patients with von Hippel- Landau patients
·	Treatment and diagnosis of renal tumors in sporadic and kidney dialysis patients
·	Treatment and diagnosis of pheochromocytomas in sporadic and hypertension patients
·	Treatment and diagnosis of eye and CNS hemangioblastomas 

Main Advantages of Technology/Invention:
·	We have found co-expression of EPO and EPOR in tumors of VHL patients. The co-expression of the ligand and receptor are related to the tumor growth and progression. Since the co-expression of EPO and EPOR are not present in most normal adult tissues, ligands that bind to EPOR but not activate the receptor can target specific tumor cells with minimal detrimental effect on normal cells. 
·	Since co-expression of EPO and EPOR is only transiently present in early embryo cells, detection of the co-expression of these proteins in tumor cells can be used for diagnosis of specific tumor cells.

Current State of Development
·	In vitro studies of tumor cell samples from a variety of tumors from von Hippel-Landau patients indicate that expression of EPOR is upregulated in these tumor cells.
·	Some of the tumor cell lines such as a kidney tumor cell line have been developed. Other tumor cell lines such as hemangioblastoma cell line from VHL patient can be cultured in the presence of EPO in the culture media. These cell lines can be used to test the effect of EPO agonist and antagonist on their growth. 

Further R&D Required:
·	Identify ligands that bind to EPOR but do not activate receptor
·	Screen ligands for activity in vitro or in vivo
·	Plan for clinical trials  to determine usefulness of ligands in diagnosing and/or treating tumors

Patent Status:
·	Patent pending 
·	Licensing of technology available

Submission Dates:
·	Letter of interest should be received by Nov.26, 2004.  Proposals will be reviewed in order of receipt

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award Sole Source to Turner International Inc.  The period of performance is for one year beginning 01 January 2005 through 31 December 2005 for the base period and two follow on option years for FY 06 and FY07.  The Air Force, Global Broadcast Service (GBS) currently uses Turner Broadcast Service/CNN for Broadcast of CNN Domestic (CNND), CNN International (CNNI), and CNN Headline News (CNNHLN).  USCENTCOM, its combined-joint task forces, its combined task forces, its component commanders, and assigned war fighters rely heavily upon continuous, 24X7, CNN domestic news feeds over GBS.  CNN live and headline news broadcasts give commanders, Intel, public affairs, and information operations officers' invaluable insight and global perspectives on global war on terrorism developments.  Such geo-political awareness is essential in shaping our Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) strategic Information Operations (IO) campaign at all operational levels. Our forces in the field require the geo-political situation awareness that the continuous CNN news feeds provide, and they need it via satellite over a portable, flexible, and tactical GBS Receive Suites.  CNN provides superior internationally recognized coverage of global events and is therefore of greater operational intelligence and information operations value than other news services available over GBS. CNN has demonstrated an ability to deliver breaking news, and offers more international correspondents and greater breadth of international coverage than the other news services.  Further, CNN coverage tends to be the most international in flavor making it an essential consideration in the essential consideration in the shaping of our strategic GWOT IO campaign. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals: however, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the agency.  The proposed procurement will be conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is HSCEAM-05-R-00013, which is issued as a Request For Proposal (RFP).  This requirement is a small business set-aside.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 611699 and the small business size standard is $6.0 million.  

The Department of homeland Security (DHS) has a requirement for a firing range to conduct mandatory quarterly qualifications and other firearms training.  The range must be within a 50-mile radius of Armonk, New York. 

The proposed ranges must meet various standards to qualify.  The range must be closed to the public during the corresponding hours.  The range must be an indoor facility.  The range must possess a minimum of ten (10) firing points.  The range must be able to accommodate a qualification course distance minimum of 1.5 yards and a maximum of 25 yards.

The range must possess some type of classroom facility with chalkboard or marker board.  The range must be able to accommodate all handgun calibers.  The range rules cannot disallow movement between firing points or restrict movement-oriented firearms training firing points by students (i.e., standing to kneeling transitions).  The range rules cannot disallow students from drawing and firing from the holster.  The range rules cannot disallow a student from  moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present (i.e., tactical move and shoot type drills where instructor/student ratio would be too restrictive).  Indoor ranges must possess a ventilation system that conforms to existing OSHA standards.  The range must have on-site parking that can accommodate four (4) full-sized vehicles.  

The proposed contract will be for (1) one base year and (4) four one-year options.  The objective is to acquire one or multiple contractors that can fulfill these requirements.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2004-25.  The following provisions in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) apply to this solicitation.  The solicitation incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if given in full text.  Full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at www.arnet.gov/far.  The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offers--Commercial Items (JAN 2004) and the clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items  (OCT 2003) applies to this acquisition.  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items (JAN 1999).  

As a minimum, Offerors proposals shall include:  Qualification Statement, Past Performance references, and Price.  The proposals will be evaluated using the following factors: 

(a)	Technical Factors
(1)  Qualification Statement – Offeror shall confirm in writing that they meet all requirements set forth in the synopsis.  However, DHS/ICE reserves the right to visit proposed site(s) to verify that the range(s) meets minimum qualifications.

(2)	Past Performance History – Offerors proposal shall include a minimum of (2)
past performance references for similar services the offeror has provided.  One of these references must be a law enforcement entity.  Verified/current points of contact shall be provided for each reference to allow the Government to speak with references about the nature and quality of service provided. 

(b)	Price Factors
Offerors shall provide pricing to cover a (1) year base period and (4) one year options.  The ranges current commercial pricing arrangements ( i.e., pricing per hour, per day, per month, etc.) will be considered in the evaluation of price.

3052.209-70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 


(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<CONTACT>Nancy Ballay, Contracting Officer, Phone 609-813-3413, Fax 609-813-3446, Email nancy.ballay@dhs.gov
<DESC>This announcement is amended to change the location, see the paragraph below. 

       This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is HSCEAM-05-R-00011, which is issued as a Request For Proposal (RFP).  This requirement is a small business set-aside.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 611699 and the small business size standard is 6.0 million. 

The Department of homeland Security (DHS) has a requirement for a firing range to conduct mandatory quarterly qualifications and other firearms training.  The range must be within a 20-mile radius or 40 minute commute of Sunrise, Florida.

The proposed ranges must meet various standards to qualify. The range must be closed to the public during the corresponding hours.  The range may be indoor or outdoor.  The range must possess a minimum of 25 firing points.  The range must be able to accommodate a qualification course distance minimum of 1.5 yards and a maximum of 25 yards.  The range must possess a public address system available during firearms training.  The range must possess some type of classroom facility.  The range must be able to accommodate all handgun calibers.  The range rules cannot disallow movement between firing points or restrict movement-oriented firearms training firing points by students (i.e. standing to kneeling transitions).  The range rules cannot disallow students from drawing and firing from the holster.  The range rules must allow shooters to utilize weapons on fully automatic fire drills.  The range rules cannot disallow a student from moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present, (i.e. lateral/perpendicular tactical movement and shoot type drills where instructor/ student ratio would be too restrictive).  The range must allow the use of steel/reactionary targets.  The range must possess a storage area dedicated to DHS inspectors/officers use that would allow general storage of equipment.  Indoor ranges must possess a ventilation system that conforms to existing OSHA standards.  The estimated days of range usage are 36 half days per quarter.  These days are normally scheduled from 7:30 a.m. until 12:00 p.m.  This equates to approximately 162 hours per quarter.  The estimated number of rounds fired per quarter is 250,000.

The proposed contract will be for (1) one base year and (4) four one-year options.  The objective is to acquire one or multiple contractors that can fulfill these requirements.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2004-25.  The following provisions in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) apply to this solicitation.  The solicitation incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if given in full text.  Full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at www.arnet.gov/far.  The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offers--Commercial Items (JAN 2004) and the clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items  (OCT 2003) applies to this acquisition.  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items (JAN 1999).  

As a minimum, Offerors proposals shall include:  Qualification Statement, Past Performance references, and Price.  The proposals will be evaluated using the following factors: 

(a)	Technical Factors
(1)  Qualification Statement – Offeror shall confirm in writing that they meet all requirements set forth in the synopsis.  However, DHS/ICE reserves the right to visit proposed site(s) to verify that the range(s) meets minimum qualifications.

(2)	Past Performance History – Offerors proposal shall include a minimum of (2)
past performance references for similar services the offeror has provided.  One of these references must be a law enforcement entity.  Verified/current points of contact shall be provided for each reference to allow the Government to speak with references about the nature and quality of service provided. 

(b)	Price Factors
Offerors shall provide pricing to cover a (1) year base period and (4) one year options.  The ranges current commercial pricing arrangements ( i.e., pricing per hour, per day, per month, etc.) will be considered in the evaluation of price. 

All evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  The Government reserves the right to determine if more than one contract will be awarded for this requirement.  The Government will award a contract or multiple contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror (s) whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Award will be made only to contractors who have registered with the Central Contractor Registration.  You can register at the CCR website: http//www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>USAID RFP TRN-05-002   Warehouse Questions and Answers (Second Set of Questions and Answers)

1. Will the government consider more than one warehouse in different locations to perform this contract?   Answer: Yes, the government will consider offers that propose different warehouse locations for the preposition of our commodities.  Should more than one warehouse be proposed, and accepted by the government, the estimated range for the total tonnage of pre-positioned commodities stated in the solicitation will not change.

2. Will the government consider a joint venture or a prime/subcontract arrangement for this contract?  Answer: Yes, both organizational agreements will be considered by the government.

3. Will the government consider the quantity that the contractor can handle each day (through-put) on delivery or re-delivery of commodities?  Answer: Yes.  See the Evaluation Factors stated in the solicitation.

4. Where can I find the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses that are referenced in the solicitation?  Answer: The FAR clauses may be found at the web site: www.arnet.gov. 

5. Can the proposal include photographs and maps?  Answer: Yes.

6. Can a contractor propose various options to the government?  For example can we propose various options with warehouse locations in the Gulf, eastern seaboard, and west coast as well as the central U.S.?  Answer: Yes, the government encourages the submission of various options for this contract.  The government will apply the evaluation factors contained in the solicitation to determine the best value contract for the government.
 
7. Does the proposed warehouse have to be within a port or a port controlled area?  Answer: No.

8. How do you want me to propose rates?  Answer: Please refer to the solicitation.  The solicitation requests proposed rates for taking delivery of commodities and placing them on the warehouse floor.  The solicitation also requests proposed rates for commodity storage and inspections.  The solicitation also request proposed rates for re-delivery of commodities on an F.o.b. Origin and F.a.s. Vessel, Port of Shipment basis.  You should propose rates for the re-delivery of commodities to various major ports that are located in your region.  You may propose rates for the re-delivery of commodities to various coastal ranges.

9. The solicitation calls for F.o.b. Origin and F.a.s. Vessel, Port of Shipment rates for re-delivery of commodities.  I assume that the food materials would be loaded at the warehouse into an ocean going container, 20 ft and 40 ft. and the container placed along side a vessel.  Is this correct?  Answer:  The definitions for re-delivery of commodities on either F.o.b. Origin or F.a.s. Vessel, Port of Shipment basis may be reviewed in the Federal Acquisition Regulations at subparts 52.247-29 and 52-247-36.
 
10. There does not appear to be mention of the format in which a quote is to be returned.  Are there particular forms or format that is required?  Answer: The government does not require a particular format for your proposal.  There are certain prices and rates that must be submitted as part of your proposal, as well as certain forms that must accompany your proposal.  Please refer to the solicitation for these required rates, prices and forms.  Of course, as required by the solicitation, rates and prices must be per metric ton.

11. Part 3, subpart B(v) of the solicitation seems to ask for ocean freight prices, however elsewhere the solicitation only requires FOB Origin and F.a.s. Vessel, Port of Shipment rates.  The solicitation also states export freight forwarding will not be required.  Would you kindly clarify?  Answer:  In Part 3 Subpart A, the solicitation states that in addition to evaluating your proposed rates and prices for services, the government will perform a cost analysis of rail and truck delivery of commodities to the proposed warehouse location and ocean freight service availability and prices from the various contractor-selected major ports or coastal ranges.  This means that we will consider your rates and prices for the services we are requesting under the contract.   In addition, we will evaluate the cost of delivering commodities to your proposed warehouse and the availability and cost of export ocean service from your location in addition to the major ports we may use for export of these commodities.  We are going to evaluate the entire cost of service from suppliers of commodities to warehouse services to export ocean service.  Your proposal should provide rates for the requested warehouse services.

12.  What is the footprint for 10,000 mt of food commodities?  Answer:  Depending on the mix of commodities and how you stack the bagged and packaged commodities, the footprint will change.  The commodities are as described in the solicitation.  Commodities may be stacked, consistent with the type of commodity bags or containers, their safe handling and lot differentiation requirements. Storage space requirements should be given careful attention. The amount of space necessary in a warehouse depends upon the total volume of food to be stored, differentiating between various car or parcel lots, and on the number of different commodities. Each commodity should be stacked separately. Separate stacks require more usable volume than one large stack (i.e., a warehouse large enough to hold 50 MT of wheat will hold less than 50 MT of wheat and sorghum stacked separately).  The difference between gross dimensions of a warehouse and usable volume for storage must be taken into consideration.  In estimating how much usable space is needed per commodity, the following rules of thumb may help. (These are estimated figures)   One MT of a bagged commodity (50 kg. bags) requires approximately 2 cubic meters of usable storage space.  One MT of edible Vegoil in tins requires approximately 1.4 cubic meters of usable storage space.  Do not stack flour and meals higher than 20 layers. Do not stack grits or whole grains higher than 30-40 layers.   The source for the above is the Commodities Reference Guide, which may be found on the USAID web site at WWW.USAID.GOV .
