<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is conducting a Full and Open competition to acquire the services of qualified U.S. Contractors to provide services to support vocational and technical training in general, and employment services in Iraq, specifically.  In response to Iraq’s high unemployment rate, USAID/Iraq will procure technical assistance to help the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA) implement a broad scale workforce development initiative.  The Contractor, using experienced personnel, will assist, in coordination with USAID, the Coalition Provisional Authority, and MOLSA, with the  implementation of  a two-year base contract (with two one-year option periods) to establish and operate 17 vocational and technical training centers and 28 employment centers throughout Iraq.  Prior to developing a work plan to establish these centers, the Contractor will conduct a rapid labor market study throughout Iraq that will compare vocational and technical skills needed by the local private sector with the existing skills and abilities of the local workforce.  Such an analysis will enable the contractor to develop vocational training programs tailored for local private sector needs that bridge the skills gap.  The contractor will also provide necessary training to MOLSA staff to ensure a smooth transition of the centers operation from the Contractor to MOLSA before the end of the contract.

The period of performance for this contract is estimated to be two (2) years from the date of award of the contract.  NAIC:   611 Education Services.

The preferred method of distributing the USAID Procurement information will be through Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fbo.gov).  It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued on or about April 2, 2004.  It is the responsibility of the recipient of this solicitation to ensure that it has been received in its entirety and USAID bears no responsibility for data error(s) resulting from downloading.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY AND NOT/NOT A SOLICITATION. THE RFI IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING INDUSTRY COMMENTS ON HOW THE GOVERNMENT CAN SATISFY ITS NEEDS; ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES; TECHNOLOGY AVAILABILITY AND RISK; THE IDENTIFICATION OF COST DRIVERS; AND SUGGESTIONS ON WAYS TO ENHANCE OR SUSTAIN COMPETITION.

The Office of Foreign Missions (OFM) in the Department of State seeks to institute a credit and/or debit card based system to manage diplomatic tax relief in the United States.  

OFM seeks from the private sector proposals for the provision of tax reclamation services initiated through the use of a provider issued “tax-exempt” credit or debit card to foreign missions and their eligible personnel.  The U.S. government will not/not underwrite or assume any liability for these credit/debit cards, and also will not/not guarantee payment of the debts on these credit cards in any fashion. All risk in extending credit will fall on the issuing company. 

OFM envisions the use of a credit/debit card-based system for facilitating the government’s diplomatic tax relief obligations.  This credit/debit card will serve as the only means a foreign mission or member would have in obtaining diplomatic tax relief on standard purchases.   Therefore, OFM estimates that such credit/debit cards will be used frequently and will likely have a higher average use-rate in comparison to those issued to average consumers.  

There are roughly 15,000 diplomatic tax-exemption cards currently circulating throughout the United States.  The National Capital Planning Commission estimates the annual consumer spending of foreign missions and their members in the Washington Metropolitan Region (DC, MD, VA) as $290 million.   This figure does not include the annual spending of foreign missions in other states with high concentrations of foreign missions, such as New York, California, Florida and Texas.

The provision of this service will attract the operating accounts of foreign missions and international organizations as well as the accounts of their members to the banks participating in this program.  Therefore, providers stand to generate new revenues not only from providing this system, but through the added customer and deposit base that goes along with providing banking services to such account holders.  

As a point of reference concerning the credit worthiness of foreign missions and their members, in conjunction with participating oil companies, OFM has provided “tax-exempt” gasoline credit cards to foreign missions and diplomats since the mid-1980s.  Although, the tax-relief mechanism used with this card is vastly different from the one described in this document, the extension and management of credit to foreign missions and their members is basically identical.   Over the past 20 years, the providers of the “tax-exempt” gasoline credit cards have reported extremely few problems concerning foreign missions or their members as routinely delinquent or unable to pay balances on such accounts.  A list of the oil companies that participate in the “tax-exempt gasoline credit card program can be viewed on the OFM website at www.state.gov/ofm/tax/gasoline/24625.htm.   

This Request for Information not only offers the opportunity for proposers to present a solution to OFM’s business process needs for a credit and/or debit card based diplomatic tax relief program, but to propose added services that might realize the Department of State’s vision of electronic and streamlined government business processes, both domestically and abroad.

Currently, OFM plans to offer this opportunity to all proposers capable of meeting or exceeding the requirements established in this document.   

Background of the Diplomatic Tax Exemption Process:
The Foreign Missions Act of 1982 (22 USC 4301-4316) requires that OFM manage the U.S. Government’s provision of certain diplomatic privileges on the basis of reciprocity.  The U.S. Government’s obligation to provide diplomatic tax relief is primarily a result of both the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.  However, this privilege is also an obligation of various other bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements, such as the United Nations Headquarters’ Agreement.  

Due to the reciprocity requirement in the Foreign Missions Act, OFM is required to provide foreign missions with diplomatic tax relief privileges to the extent that each counterpart foreign government provides such relief to the U.S. diplomatic mission and its members.   Therefore, OFM limits or denies tax exemption to missions that limit or deny tax relief to U. S. diplomatic representatives in the host country.

Proposers should refer to the OFM website at http://www.state.gov/ofm/ and the Department of State website at www.state.gov for information about the OFM mission, organization, customer services, and current initiatives.

Outline for responses to RFI:
The following sections provide a recommended outline for responses to this RFI. This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the Government.

Section 1 Conceptual Alternatives
The Government is interested in conceptual alternatives for the concept described above. The Department of State encourages creativity, and cost saving responses to this RFI. Briefly describe one or more high-level alternative application concepts, assumptions based on information provided.

Section 2 Program Management Approach
Proposed strategies should consider OFM’s evolving mission and role, responsibilities, security and technical environment, and budget constraints that drive the need for an agile, responsive, cost effective system. Indicate the types of deliverables that may be provided and performance metrics to be used to measure the success of the program. Describe perceived potential technical or security risks and how those risks could be effectively mitigated through the acquisition strategy, source selection, and performance management process. (Sections 1 and 2 should not exceed 10 pages combined.)

Section 3 Experience
Describe up to three key projects the company participated in that are similar in size, scope and complexity to the OFM environment, potentially within the Federal Government arena. Briefly describe the customer environment, application solution designed / implemented, project management methodology, security requirements, best practices, and relevant lessons learned. In addition, proposers should indicate their General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract number, if applicable. Indicate size (e.g. number of client sites, transaction volumes, dollar value of each contract or project), scope, and complexity of the efforts cited. (3 pages)

Review of vendor responses and information exchange meeting(s):
The Government will review submissions to ascertain the relevance to the OFM environment and goals. Prior to review of vendor responses to the RFI, OFM may at their discretion hold technical information exchange meeting(s) with respondents. The meeting(s) will focus on industry experiences related to development, technical solutions, best practices and lessons learned, risks and programmatic benefits.

<DESC>This is a sources sought/market survey to identify qualified small business to provide pneumatic tube stations (six inch carriers) for the National Institutes of Health, Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center, Clinical Research Center, located in Bethesda, Maryland.  The contractor shall furnish and install three pneumatic stations (six inch carriers) in the CRC.  The stations will be located in the Pediatric Clinic, Alcohol Clinical and the 5NE patient care unit.  The stations required must meet the standards with the existing Swisslog six-inch recessed pneumatic tube system that currently are throughout the Clinical Center complex.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 332919.  The features and system specifications of the existing Swisslog system include:  Recessed stations for optimal receiving and dispatching of carriers. Receiving bin accommodates several carriers at one time with the ability to queue a carrier for dispatch.  The recessed stations provide a clean installation.  Stations can be added with minimal disruption to the work area either during the construction phase of the project or within existing finished areas of the hospital as in this case; LQ Control Panel on each new system which incorporates user-friendly features to make it easy to and carriers access system information and diagnose station problems.  Features to include: backlit LCD panel (240 horizontal by 64 vertical pixel display), numeric keypad, direct access keypad (send/enter, cancel/clear, menu, director, empty, send), Twelve button Quick Key Panel with LED Indicators (configurable as speed dial buttons, personal indicators with discrete addresses, and as a returned carrier indicator).  Panel Options to include: Audible Full Station, Audible Carrier Arrival, Audible Surplus Indicator, Contrast Adjustment, Audio Level, Set Time & Date.  Transaction, View Last 30 Transactions, Station Directory. TL 2005 Software offering maximum flexibility, performance and convenience in the management and maintenance of the pneumatic tube system.  Operational features include: Vibrant Graphical User Interface, Dynamic System Monitoring/Administration for rapid event diagnosis with problem-resolution and system scheduling, Real-Time Carrier Tracking in order to provide maintenance staff and users with current travel status, Event Reporting to provide maintenance and management reports that are easy to assemble in text, graphics and customized formats, and a Heightened System Security with Auto Log-Off feature to guarantee only authorized access users to the system.  The new control panels must offer exactly the same features and mode of operation as existing control panels so that the staff are not required t learn different hardware, software and operational processes.  Standardization of the pneumatic tube system reduces user error and maintenance/repair costs.  The work to be performed shall include all modifications needed for the installation of the additional tube stations.  Modifications may include but are not limited to: installing, terminating and labeling communication cable; cutting hoes in walls for installation; removal and repair of existing walls, wall coverings, ceilings, floor coverings, etc.; Patching and fireproofing wall penetrations; Removal and repair of ceiling tiles; Providing dust partitions, as required; Supply and installation of access panel; Furring in stations (stud, drywall and finish); Cleanup and disposal of debris.  Provisions shall be made for a full service warranty along with no additional cost to Government upgrades to the system software which occur during the warranty period.  The current software being used is TL 2005 software.  This software is operationally compatible with the current system and provides the 6 inch stations with no operating problems. Those small business firms who are interested in providing capability statements are specifically required to provide sufficient enough detail so that the Government can determine the capability of your firm to completely meet all of the Government’s requirements.  1) The vendor must demonstrate their approach that their system will have operational capabilities in interfacing with the existing Swisslog 6 inch, Recessed Pneumatic Tube Stations with I.Q. control panel and TL2005 software.  2) Provide at least 2 customer references for existing large healthcare systems (250 inpatients beds, 100 day hospital stations along with outpatient clinics and supporting diagnostic and treatment areas)that have successfully integrated a new pneumatic tube system with an existing system (same hardware, software and control panel) that  is currently in place in the healthcare system. Identify the names and phone numbers of the contact points..  3) Provide a description of your system specifications, features, drawings and operating software along with an actual control panel or drawings of such for review and evaluation and include written explanation of how hardware and software will integrate/interface with the current system in the CRC.  In your capability statement please provide a detailed description of how integration will be achieved.  The written capability statement including all supporting documentation should be submitted to the address in this sources sought synopsis no later than 15 days after the published date of this synopsis (by no later than 10:00am on June 27, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements will not be acceptable.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Deborah Britton at dbritton@cc.nih.gov.
