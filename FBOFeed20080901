<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Quotes are due no later than 10:00 AM (prevailing local time at U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground, Utah),   Wednesday , 10 Sep 2008.   <BR><BR>DETAILED REQUIREMENTS:<BR>	The following upgrades are 	required to both hardware components and CBNET software: <BR><BR>	Hardware Acquisition/Equipment Integration<BR><BR>	Compatibility between Power Control Module (PCM) V. 3 and PCM V. 4 is required so that either 	unit with associated slit samplers can be used with any High Performance Asynchronous 			Multiplexing System (HPAMS) controller. The PCM V. 4 provides feedback from the slit-to-agar 		sampler (STA-203) while the PCM V. 3 does not provide any feedback. Consequently, they 		should not be combined in a single trial, to ease field trial simplification and data correlation. <BR>	<BR>	Compatibility between HPAMS 3.0 and 3.1. Currently, the Life Science Division has 			5 HPAMS V. 3.0 which operate at a different voltage than V. 3.1. Interoperability is 			required so that both HPAMS versions can operate with either the PCM V. 3 or PCM 			V. 4. <BR>	<BR>	Given the number of referee towers now accessible to Life Sciences, there are several 			configuration items that need to be addressed related to wireless communications, 			ensuring that the user is able to define a unique equipment set for each trial, 				recognizing that trials vary in size and scope.  Also, user documentation requires 			updates to correspond with these enhancements. <BR><BR>	XMX/102 Enhancements <BR><BR>	Trials that utilize agent-like organisms (ALOs) as test organisms require the use of 			the Concentrator Fluorescence Aerosol Particle Sensor (CFLAPS) and High Volume Aerosol 		Sampler (XMX/102), but do not require other referee equipment, such as the HPAMS and 		PCM/Slit Samplers. Currently the XMX/102 requires an HPAMS as the 				controller/communications interface to the command station. An upgrade is required to allow the 		CFLAPS to act as the controller. This simplifies the test grid setup and operation so that only the 		CFLAPS and XMX/102 are required.   The XMX/102 currently operates with 10ml vials, but 		there is a new requirement to reduce volume and utilize 5ml vials. Secondly, there is a new 		requirement to add flush cycles, reducing the amount of carryover between trials.  Also, user 		documentation requires updates to correspond with these enhancements<BR>	<BR>	Each of the above items needs to be verified independently, followed by system 				validation, ensuring that full interoperability has been implemented with multiple 				referee towers. Full system-wide validation at Dugway utilizing the outdoor test grid 				is required. The Life Science Division has also requested additional miscellaneous 				equipment components, including cables, antennas, slit sampler trays, and towers, to 				ensure proper operation.<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>1. Title: Colposcopy Training Program for Women's Healthcare Providers2. Solicitation Reference Number: VA-101-08-RQ-0266 3. Description: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Responses reflecting availability of the service as described are requested in the form of a written technical and price quotation. This solicitation is being issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The NAICS code is 611710 (Educational Support Services) with a small business size standard $6.5M. All responsible sources may submit a quotation that, if timely received, shall be considered by the agency. Questions in response to this solicitation are due September 5, 2008 NLT 4:00 PM EST. The due date for quotations is September 17, 2008 at 4:00 PM EST. Quotations shall be submitted electronically via email to Shaundra J. Duggans at shaundra.duggans@va.gov AND Priscilla Lee at Priscilla.Lee@va.gov. The solicitation title and reference number shall be included in the subject line of ALL correspondence. 4. Statement of Work: (As a result of character limitations, only an excerpt of the Statement of Work (SOW) has been provided. Interested Offerors shall contact both Shaundra J. Duggans AND Priscilla Lee via email for copies of the SOW. Telephone requests will NOT be accepted.)  The purpose of this statement of work is to acquire a certified colposcopy training program for women health care practitioners. Colposcopy is currently available on a limited basis within the VHA, few women health care providers (NPs/PAs/MDs) are certified to perform these screening and surveillance examinations. Successful completion of this training program will result in an increase in the services provided as well as reduce the current wait times to have the colposcopy procedure performed.  This training will also ensure more rapid diagnoses and optimal health care treatment. The practitioners receiving this training will have a minimum of 2 years experience in women's health care. Additionally, a minimum of two practitioners (total of 80 practitioners shall be trained) from each Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) will participate in this training program. Within the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA), limited numbers of nurse practitioners (NPs), physician's assistants (PAs) and MDs are certified to perform screening and surveillance examinations to women veterans. Information from VHA front-line providers has documented gaps in staffing and insufficient equipment to meet the needs of the growing number of women veterans who are seeking VHA services.  Many VHA women veteran health clinics are without adequate equipment or services necessary to provide care to a rapidly increasing number of women veterans. These inadequacies will only increase in the near future.  In FY 2007, a total of 255,374 women veterans utilized VHA healthcare.  With increases in the number of women in active duty military service relative to men, the proportion of the veteran population that is female is also projected to increase steadily.  Services and equipment are urgently needed to address existing gaps in medical clinics, radiology gynecology services provision, nurse education, and care coordination for women veteran who seek care from VHA. Approximately 39.9% of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operations Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) returning veterans are women who utilize VHA. The sexually transmitted Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the key risk factor for cervical carcinoma.  Sexually transmitted infections are more prevalent in persons under 30 years of age.  Since the 67% of returning female OIF/OEF veterans are under the age of 30 the vulnerability of this population indicates the need for colposcopy and certified practitioners to perform this procedure. These statistics coupled with the anticipated increase of women veterans in the years to come, creates an immediate need for colposcopy training. The successful Contractor shall provide a comprehensive colposcopy training program for approximately 80 nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants and physicians.  The Contractor's training program shall, at a minimum, meet the following requirements: 1. Training course shall be certified/accredited by either the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) or the American Medical Association (AMA); 2. The training shall address, at a minimum, the following: a. Describe the anatomy, cytology, histology, and colposcopic findings of the normal and abnormal cervix, vagina, and vulva; b. Discuss the challenges of colposcopy and management of cervical neoplasia for selected patient populations, women infected with HIV, underserved women, and pregnant women based upon best available practices; c. Perform appropriate cytologic sampling, colposcopic evaluation, and biopsies (including endocervical sampling), and become familiar with instrumentation and necessary supplies, d. Provide hands-on sessions for the colposcopy procedure and biopsy techniques; and e. The Contractor shall submit a program evaluation after the completion of each training class. All training shall be administered and completed no later than September 30, 2010. Type of Contract:  Firm Fixed Price.
