<DESC>The FAA seeks a supplier to develop and maintain a Retirement Benefits Calculator application.  The FAA requires a web-based interactive Retirement Benefits Calculator with both a Human Resources Specialist function and an Employee function that would allow the users to perform multiple retirement estimate calculations.

The Federal Aviation Administrations mission is to provide the safest, most efficient aerospace system in the world. The FAA strives to reach the next level of safety, efficiency, environmental responsibility and global leadership. It is accountable to the flying public and our stakeholders. Its success depends on the respect, diversity, collaboration, and commitment of our workforce. Safety is our passion and people are our strength.

These services will be available to approximately 48,000-50,000 FAA employees, dependents and those persons who have an equivalent relationship as a family member.  These services are provided in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories including St. Croix Island, St. Thomas Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Marshall Islands, American Samoa, Guam and those employees working on a foreign assignment.

Of the approximate 48,000 FAA employees, almost 28,800 employees are air traffic controllers who, because of the terms of their employment, require specialized retirement benefits calculations and certification of specialized retirement coverage provisions per FAA 3300-30 (Creditable Service Computation).

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND</span></strong>
<p>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) Deployment and Market Transformation Center (D&amp;MT) is responsible for providing support of several activities of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) related to accelerating the use of alternative fuels and other advanced vehicle and fuel technologies. Providing unbiased technical information, tools, and resources is a requirement of several pieces of federal legislation, including the Alternative Motor Fuels Act (AMFA) of 1988, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992 and 1995. NREL has the lead responsibility for providing this technical resource, which has taken the form of vehicle and fleet evaluations, data collection and research, development of on-line tools and resources, and overall integration and management of this base of knowledge in the Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC).</p>
<p>In particular, NREL efforts support the Clean Cities Program and Clean Cities coalitions and coordinators in their localized deployment efforts to assist local fleets in converting to the use of alternative fuel and advanced vehicles. Assistance takes the form of a wide variety of technical and outreach activities to support the displacement of petroleum in transportation by increasing understanding and awareness of alternative and advanced fuel and vehicle technologies and the sharing of best practices among coalitions by providing all necessary technical information and resources. Resources are provided via a variety of methods to include but not limited to the AFDC web site, other relevant industry websites, through the Clean Cities Technical Response Service (TRS) as well via NREL staff.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OBJECTIVE</span></strong></p>
<p>NREL is seeking one or more organizations to assist with inquiry response, writing and editing both print and web content as well as the maintenance and management of data related to the field of alternative fuel and advanced vehicles, fuel production and feedstock, and fuel and vehicle related DOE programs. The major tasks associated with this effort include:</p>
<p>&bull; Responding to inquiries ranging from general to complex and specialized in nature, while providing appropriate technical information and resources. Inquiries may be from Clean Cities stakeholders or Coordinators, industry, researchers, analysts, DOE, National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) and NREL or the public, and will be related to deployment, production, distribution and use of alternative and advanced fuels and vehicles. <br />&bull; Assisting NREL in the maintenance and management of database content related to alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies. Key areas of focus include relevant federal, state and local legislation and incentives, fueling stations and information on alternative fuel and advanced vehicles.<br />&bull; Assisting NREL with maintenance of existing web content as well as the creation and/or development of both print and web content on alternative and advanced fuels and vehicles.</p>
<p>Tasks will require identifying resources and information about, and maintaining knowledge of, the deployment of alternative fuels and advanced fuel and vehicle technologies, the related industries, and applications through reading and researching, Web searches, electronic newsletters, industry contacts, etc. For the purposes of this activity, alternative fuels include those established by EPAct, including ethanol, natural gas, propane, electricity, biodiesel, and hydrogen. Examples of advanced fuel and vehicle technologies to be covered include other fuel blends such as E10 (10% ethanol/90% gasoline) and B20 (20% biodiesel/80% diesel), other biodiesel blends, diesel, light- and heavy-duty hybrid electric vehicles, light- and medium-duty passenger diesel vehicles, idle reduction technologies, fuel efficient vehicles, and other fuel economy measures.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AREAS OF EXPERTISE</span></strong></p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought announcement is to identify interested sources for the Blasting Cap family of items listed below.  This announcement is in support of Market Research performed by the United States Army Contracting Command - Rock Island, to determine interest in a planned Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 procurement for the Blasting Cap family of items.  The U.S. Government (USG) anticipates a total contract length of 3-5 years.  <br>  <br> Item Descriptions: <br>  <br> DODIC M130, NSN 1375-01-316-1229, Cap, Blasting, Electric, M6 Assembly.  <br> The Electric Blasting Cap M6 is used to initiate high explosives with a blasting machine or other suitable source of electric power. It is capable of detonating all standard military explosives. <br> *  Assembly Dwg 8830972, Packaging Dwg 12913870. <br> *  Cup Maximum Diameter= 0.24-0.26; Cup Maximum Length= 2.35 in.; Approx  <br> Explosive Weight= 1.33 grams <br> *  Base charge of RDX, an intermediate charge of lead azide, and an ignition charge in an aluminum alloy cup. <br> *  Two 12-foot lead wires olive drab in color, connected by a bridge wire in the ignition charge, extend through a rubber (or rubber and sulfur) plug assembly in the open end of the cup. Two circumferential crimps secure the plug assembly in  <br> the cup.  <br>  <br> DODIC M131, NSN 1375-01-315-1335, Cap, Blasting, Non-Electric, M7 Assembly.  <br> The Non-Electric Blasting Cap M7 is used to detonate all military explosives.  When initiated by time-blasting fuse, primer, or detonating cord the ignition charge detonates the intermediate charge which detonates the base charge in turn.  Detonation of the base charge initiates the explosive charge. <br>  <br> *  Assembly Dwg 8830948, Packaging Dwg 12913876. <br> *  Cup Maximum Diameter= 0.24-0.26; Cup Maximum Length= 2.35 in.; Approx  <br> Explosive Weight= 1.25 grams.  <br> *  This non-electric blasting cap consists of an aluminum alloy cup containing an ignition charge of lead styphnate, an intermediate charge of lead azide, and a base charge of RDX. <br> *  The cup is flared at the mouth to mate with the matching shape of the nipple of a firing device.  Base coupling and the flared end facilitates insertion of time-blasting fuse or detonating cord. <br> *  NOTE:  there are two different cap loading methods as follows:  (1) Separate increments of intermediate charge (lead azide) and ignition charge (lead  <br> styphnate); OR (2) 60/40 mixture with 60% lead azide and 40% lead styphnate. <br>  <br> DODIC M097, NSN 1375-00-621-8362, Dummy Cap, Blasting, Inert, Non-Electric M30  <br> Assembly.   <br> The M30 Dummy Blasting Cap is the inert version of the M7 Non-Electric Blasting Cap. <br>  <br> *  Assembly Dwg 8864810, Packaging Dwg IAW JM&L 193 Commercial Packaging Requirements. <br> *  Cup Maximum Diameter= 0.24-0.26; Cup Maximum Length= 2.35 in.; Approx  <br> Explosive Weight= 0 grams. <br> *  The inert non-electric blasting consists of an aluminum alloy cup that does not  <br> contain any explosive material.  Aluminum alloy cup is to be cast loaded or contain  <br> aluminum filler pretreated with loctite.  The cup must have two thru-holes and be  <br> brown in color to indicate inert. <br>  <br> The manufacturing process of the Blasting Cap items encompasses, but is not limited to, a pressing process for primary and secondary explosives within a tolerance of +/- 200 psi.  For different stages of the manufacturing process, special inspection and test equipment is required to ensure that the final products comply with USG requirements.  The Contractor will be required to successfully conduct First Article Acceptance and Lot Acceptance tests on the items.  The Blasting Cap items are procured to USG Technical Data Packages (TDPs).  The entire USG TDPs will not be provided in support of this market research; however top-level and packaging drawings identified above are available for interested sources to review.  The drawings are Distribution Statement A, which means distribution is authorized for public release; distribution is unlimited.  Interested contractors that would like to obtain the top-level and packaging drawings must submit a written request to the POC identified below.   <br>  <br> Requirements: <br>  <br> It is anticipated that a Request for Proposal would solicit for the following anticipated requirements, with a resultant Contract award for USG FY 14 requirements as a base quantity, and options included for USG FYs 15-18 anticipated and possible unplanned requirements.

<DESC>1.)  The US Army Directorate for System of Systems Integration (hereinafter referred to as SoSI) is seeking interested sources with mature solutions to enhance existing network systems capabilities to participate in a Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) event scheduled to occur in October/November 2013 (referred to as NIE 14.1) at Ft. Bliss, TX and the adjacent White Sands Missile Range (WSMR).  The purpose of this notice is to identify emerging capabilities to be evaluated against a set of entrance criteria for an opportunity to participate in an NIE. This Sources Sought seeks solutions with a narrow focus on Specific Identified Gaps in the current and evolving networked equipment solution set.  Functional requirements for these gaps are listed in Paragraph 2. These gaps are: <br>  <br> Gap 1: Brigade/Battalion Command Post (CP) Mobility and Scalability <br> Gap 3: Network Visualization on the Common Operational Picture (COP) <br> Gap 5: Aerial layer Network Extension - Provide assured access for terrestrial network <br> Gap 8: Integrated Network Assurance - Network Access Control <br> Gap 16: Operational Energy - Energy sources with extended duration and power <br> Gap 17: Operational Energy - Monitor and manage system power, supply and demand  <br> Gap 19: Operational Energy - Reduce reliance on petroleum based energy <br> (Gap numbers 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 18 are reserved)  <br>  <br> 2.) The NIE is an Army hosted event conducted twice a year. The NIE is approximately two to six weeks long and employs the full brigade strength of a Brigade Combat Team (BCT) at Fort Bliss, TX.  The goal is to conduct parallel systems tests of Army programs, evaluation of new network technology capabilities, non-network capabilities and emerging in-theater capabilities and concepts. The NIE events will include tactical exercises using current force equipment and emerging networked systems.  <br>  <br> 3.) This is a Sources Sought announcement. This does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP), an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or as an obligation or commitment on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service. There is no basis for claims against the Government as a result of information submitted or demonstrations provided in response to this Sources Sought announcement. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement or otherwise pay for any information or demonstrations provided by respondents to this request. This notice is for market research purposes only and is not indicative of a full requirement.   <br>  <br> 4.) Sources must understand the entire financial burden of participating in this process to include: submitting a White Paper, briefing, and Training Support Package; attending and providing an Oral Presentation at the System Under Evaluation (SUE) Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM); submitting solution candidates for laboratory testing at a Government facility; undergoing integration and Lab Based Risk Reduction (LBRR) at Aberdeen Proving Ground , MD through the duration of NIE;  participating in pre-NIE integration activities; training soldiers to operate the candidate solution; and participating in; supporting the candidate solution in the NIE event at Fort Bliss, TX and White Sands Missile Range, NM and post-NIE de-installation and recovery activities  will be the sole financial responsibility of the source.   <br>  <br> 5.) The Government will provide a venue for an Oral presentation, assessment services and venue for the candidate solution laboratory testing, integration risk reduction venue, host platform and services and access to the NIE site and facilities.  The Government may provide integration support to integrate candidate solutions into military platforms and assist in network integration where applicable.    <br>  <br> 6.) Eligible Respondents: The Sources Sought process as part of the NIE is open to US and non-US industry. Respondents that are not able to provide a solution to one of the Specific Identified Gaps with a solution that is rated at a Technical Readiness Level  of  six (TRL-6) or better (see ATTACHMENT 2) or are not able to participate throughout the entire NIE process should not submit a initiate this process by preparing a White Paper. Potential respondents are encouraged to review this entire document thoroughly and carefully consider their ability and willingness to fully participate in the process up to and including the NIE prior to committing to submit a White Paper.  <br>  <br> 7.) Connection to a Classified Network:  The NIE 14.1 will incorporate classified capabilities at some tiers of network integration.  The government may change the classification of the network due to operational and test needs at any time.  Source's proposed solutions to be utilized on the classified portions of the network will be required to meet the Information Assurance (IA) requirements of the classified network. Changes to the network classification may preclude proposed systems from participating in the NIE. The source's equipment if incorporated into the NIE may be exposed to classified information and could result in the need to sanitize the equipment after the event.  This process may include the retention by the Army or destruction of the data storage elements of the source's equipment (e.g. hard drives, flash drives, CDs, non-volatile memory.)  Support personnel will be required to have a current SECRET security clearance.  The Government may provide DIACAP accreditation support to candidate solutions without a government sponsor/Designated Approval Authority (DAA) where applicable. <br>  <br> 8.) Government Program of Record Candidates:  If your potential candidate solution is being funded under a Government program of record, you are advised to contact your Government program manager regarding the suitability of submitting the candidate for the NIE as a vendor candidate.  There is a separate concurrent process for submitting Government candidate solutions to the NIE and your Government program manager may have programmatic concerns about exposing the candidate to the NIE concurrent with program execution.  <br>  <br> *REFER TO ATTACHMENT(S) FOR CONTINUATION OF NOTICE REQUIREMENTS*

The contractor shall be required to 1) develop compliance test procedures for vehicular electronic products and 2) support the preparation of the relevant Federal Register Notices and responses to inquiries.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>On February 13, 2012, the FMCSA announced its intent to move forward with the Electronic On-Board Recorders (EOBR) and Hours of Service Supporting Documents Rulemaking, informally known as EOBR2, by preparing a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (SNPRM). [Footnote 1.] In the SNPRM, FMCSA will propose new and expanded technical specifications for EOBRs based on comments received from our stakeholders and the statutory requirements specified in "Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21)". [Footnote 2.] This law requires the Secretary of Transportation to require use of electronic logging devices (ELD) [Footnote 3.] for commercial motor vehicle operators who are subject to paper records of duty status (RODS) records-keeping requirements. <br /><br />MAP-21 also directs FMCSA to develop certification criteria for compliant ELDs as follows:<br /><br />``(c) Certification Criteria.--<br />``(1) In general.--The regulations prescribed by the Secretary <br />under this section shall establish the criteria and a process for <br />the certification of electronic logging devices to ensure that the <br />device meets the performance requirements under this section.<br />``(2) Effect of noncertification.--Electronic logging devices <br />that are not certified in accordance with the certification process <br />referred to in paragraph (1) shall not be acceptable evidence of <br />hours of service and record of duty status requirements under part <br />395 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations."</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment, and facilities, unless otherwise specified, to perform&nbsp;all work.&nbsp; The contractor shall be able to develop a standard set of ELD Compliance Test Procedures for blackbox testing of ELDs with respect to the functional requirements to be specified in the ELD SNPRM and a standard test output report template.

<p>The contractor shall address its capabilities regarding the development of software, algorithms, and input/output files necessary to standardize the test procedures.</p>
<p>The main objective is a complete and concise ELD Compliance Test Procedure document that would be published and could be used by independent organizations to test ELDs for compliance. This document shall have all the necessary details such that an independent third party with reasonable test and validation expertise can follow this process without the need for assistance.</p>
<p><em>Develop standard test report template</em></p>

<SUBJECT>A--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - OCEAN COLOR REMOTE SENSING VICARIOUS IN SITUCALIBRATION INSTRUMENTS

<a href="mailto:p.ghuman@nasa.gov">Mr. Parminder  Ghuman</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE. A. Request Summary The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is seeking ways to provide or develop in situ vicarious calibration instruments, systems, and approaches for a future mission's ocean color instrument. This RFI asks organizations to provide information regarding current instrument capabilities or descriptions of developments that would be needed in order to provide an in situ vicarious calibration capability for maintaining global climate quality ocean color remote sensing reflectances for a multi- or hyperspectral sensor. "Vicarious" calibration for ocean color refers to a final bias adjustment to the calibrated, spectral top-of-atmosphere radiances observed by an ocean color instrument. Responses could consider the PACE Science Definition Team (SDT) report (found at http://dsm.gsfc.nasa.gov/PACE.html	 ) for details of sample vicarious calibration for ocean color requirements, particularly the details in Section 4.6.1 of the report. B. Background Earth's ocean supports a nearly one trillion-dollar economy. There is increasing climate variability and change occurring in the Earth System which impacts aquatic ecology, chemistry, and biology. Satellite ocean color data provides new information for understanding Earth's living ocean and for improving forecasts of Earth System variability and the impacts and feedbacks on ocean ecosystems and biogeochemistry (e.g., fisheries, carbon cycle, harmful algal blooms and public health, marine resources, land/ocean interactions, etc.). A satellite ocean color mission can achieve these objectives by making climate quality global ocean color measurements that are essential for understanding aspects of the Earth system, such as the carbon cycle and its interrelationship with climate change, and by expanding our understanding about ocean ecology and biogeochemistry. The success of an ocean color mission relies on a combination of satellite remote sensing, field measurements (e.g., ship, mooring, and drifter), Earth system modeling, and synthesis efforts designed to address specific science questions. The ability of an ocean color mission to meet its key science objectives depends primarily upon the quality, accuracy, and precision of the ocean ecosystem, aerosol, and cloud data products that can be derived from engineering data collected by the sensor. To produce a time series of spectral ocean color data of sufficient quality for research, the ocean color sensor must have stringent calibration and validation (cal/val) data requirements for quantifying ocean color sensor performance; the accuracy, precision, and associated uncertainties of the retrievals; and their drift over the spacecraft operational lifetime. Future NASA ocean color science applications require highly accurate Rrs(Lambda) (spectral remote sensing reflectances). Maintaining sufficient accuracy over the lifetime of the mission will require a robust vicarious calibration program that complements the onboard calibration devices and enables routine verification of the ocean color instrument calibration while operating on orbit. In situ measurements of Rrs(Lambda) will provide the principle source of ground truth for the operational vicarious calibration activity. Historically for ocean color retrievals, measured top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectances are regressed against coincident near-surface ocean reflectances to establish a gain factor for a given satellite ocean radiometer. This process is referred to as the 'vicarious calibration' and, for heritage ocean missions, as well as for current and future missions, it requires a dedicated calibration program. Vicarious calibration measurements are best conducted at an open ocean location where atmospheric aerosol loads and variability are minimal (e.g., most heritage sensors relied on measurements made off Lana'i Hawaii by the Marine Optical BuoY). For any given satellite-surface reflectance pair, some uncertainty remains due to unconstrained aerosol impacts. However, collecting many paired observations over all seasons minimizes this uncertainty, such that the time series of observations converges on a single gain factor. For the SeaWiFS mission, this convergence required more than two years. Once a reliable gain factor is established (one goal would be to achieve this gain within the first year of operations), it is used to scale TOA reflectances measured elsewhere. This vicarious calibration procedure is not impacted by global variability in atmospheric aerosols, although some error can still exist if an aerosol bias persists in all the field-satellite data pairs. Historically, atmospheric measurements have not accompanied the ocean vicarious calibration measurements. Inclusion of additional observations (e.g., sun-photometer measurements) would be advised. Once a sensor gain factor is determined, the resultant calibrated global data set of TOA reflectances must then be corrected for local atmospheric conditions to retrieve water-leaving radiances, and it is in this procedure (currently based on the NIR and SWIR approach described above) that errors can arise from uncertainties in aerosol characteristics. In addition to the magnitude of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) itself, spectral AOD and absorbing AOD (AAOD) 'slopes' of different aerosol types need to be taken into account for maximum aerosol correction accuracy. Key aerosol types that dominate at different locations and in different seasons over the ocean include Saharan dust, Gobi dust, different types of organic ("brown") carbon (e.g., most wildfire smoke and urban pollution particles), black carbon (e.g. from diesel and some fire combustion products), sea salt, and sulfate particles. The shortest measurement band in most heritage ocean color missions (e.g., SeaWiFS, MODIS and MERIS) has been near 410 nm. As noted above, uncertainties in atmospheric corrections increase with decreasing wavelength, and at 410 nm, errors due to uncertainties in aerosol amount, type, and vertical distribution can be significant. For future ocean color missions, ocean retrievals could be extended into the near-ultraviolet (NUV) down to 350 nm. This extension may necessitate a reevaluation of the atmospheric correction approach due to difference in atmospheric optical properties between the UV and visible wavelengths (specifically, increased contribution from absorbing aerosols, as well as impacts of scattering aerosols). An evaluation is also needed of uncertainties associated with atmospheric pressure effects on the gas-scattering contribution to the TOA signal. Retrieval of ocean color dissolved organic material (CDOM) may be a particularly challenging issue for some regions and times. Specifically, the spectral shape of absorption by some aerosol types is similar to that of oceanic CDOM, both of which are most strongly absorbing in the UV. Inaccurate separation of these different components can result in significant biases in CDOM retrievals (particularly, for example, in coastal regions with high CDOM and low suspended sediment concentration), although the extent of this issue has not yet been quantified. Sufficiently robust in situ calibration/validation systems need to be developed for a future ocean color mission. Therefore, NASA is requesting information from the community on capabilities and new approaches that are available for providing in situ instrumentation to support ocean color vicarious calibration requirements. Calibration requirements for the ocean color instrument are suggested to be a prelaunch absolute calibration of 2% and on-orbit absolute calibration accuracy (before vicarious calibration) of better than 5%. Vicarious calibration should include ground-based remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) data for evaluating postlaunch instrument gains. The recommended in situ vicarious calibration instrument(s) systems to support ocean color science applications might include the following features: 1. Spectral range from 350-900 nm at less than or equal to 3 nm resolution 2. Total spectral accuracies less than or equal to 5% including contributions from all instrument calibrations and data processing steps (with NIST traceability) 3. Temporal spectral stability less than or equal to 1% per deployment (with NIST traceability) 4. Sufficient data acquisition rates to reduce vicarious gain standard errors to less than or equal to 0.2% within one year of launch (post-launch, implying the need for multiple systems that are simultaneously deployed) 5. Capability of autonomous operation for some application. Additionally, it would be expected that complementary routine field campaigns would also support a future mission to verify data quality and evaluate data product uncertainties and for data product validation. Such fieldwork is not the subject of this RFI. C. Requested Information: Responses to this RFI will be in the form of a PDF document that is uploaded through NASA's NSPIRES system (see Instructions below). Respondents are asked to provide information about existing capabilities and/or capabilities that need to be developed which could meet the requirements described above. Each response to the RFI should address the following topics, in this order: a.

<DESC>T-16 Health Management Platform (hi2) Usability Analytics Task 2 Market Research for Requirements Development

Request for Information (RFI)

HMP Usability Analytics Platform (UAP)

BACKGROUND:  
Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Transformational Initiative #16, Transforming Health Care Delivery through Health Informatics Initiative (hi2) will shape the future of VHA clinical information systems through deliberate application of health information technology (IT) and informatics to deliver solutions that transform health delivery to Veterans directly improving quality and accessibility while optimizing value and ensuring VA continues industry leadership in the use of health informatics and health information technology.  

The Health Informatics Initiative is comprised of sub-initiatives.  The effort described herein will support the Health Management Platform (HMP).  The HMP is the foundational IT tool that is helping change the future of health care delivery at VA. This technology allows care teams, software developers, technology partners, and all VA staff to participate in truly advanced delivery of patient-centered care.

The HMP platform consists of service orientated architecture that comprises three main abstraction layers.  The HMP is implemented in Java and utilizes current technologies such as restful services and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), to implement next generation modular interfaces that are customizable to the user's needs.  Central to the HMP architecture is a design allowing for collaborative development, allowing for development partners to add additional functionality or modules to the Health Management Platform. 

The HMP has three outward facing components: patient-facing, care team-facing and health care system-facing. The HMP is a software platform providing new tools to allow for the transformation of VA health care toward a patient-centered, team based care model. The platform is being designed to provide the flexibility to allow the health care team to interact with information in new ways that better support and manage their patient care workflow. 

The patient-facing platform will allow Veterans and their delegates to receive and exchange health information and engage in their care in unprecedented ways, through a variety of electronic devices. Additionally, the HMP will enable patients to interact with and contribute to their medical record. 

The system-facing or population-facing platform harnesses the power of population-level data to monitor and improve the health care system. It will allow for the creation of innovative tools using data from across VA IT systems and patient populations. It will also promote the operationalization of research work, and integrate large-scale system analyses into the workflow of the electronic health record (EHR). 

In order to create a Health Management Platform that is efficient, relevant, and responsive to care teams, patients, population health workers, and hospital system personnel, the HMP team needs an analytic software platform, tools, and support system to quantitatively and qualitatively capture and profile HMP usability and produce usability-related analytics for continual improvement, data mining and response across the wide diversity of user roles, needs, goals, situations, and actions.

Analytics and Usability Analytics: Analytics is a broad umbrella term for a rapidly advancing interdisciplinary field that leverages the large volumes of heterogeneous data being generated and managed in today's IT-driven world. Broadly, the goal of Analytics is to extract useful, actionable knowledge of events, trends or patterns from the "deluge of data" to guide workflow improvement, decision making or automating business or clinical logic. Usability Analytics is a subcategory of (Enterprise) Analytics that focuses on usage and usability patterns of Health IT systems.

Usability, as defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), refers to "effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction with which intended users can achieve their tasks in the intended context of product use." One of the pillars of functionality is to measure how the "system" is performing, leading to intervention or system redesign where necessary. Desired functional capabilities include real-time visibility into the system with transparency across the enterprise. 

The effort described here focuses on development of an integrated investigative platform to support usability analytics, performance profiling, and business intelligence needs of HMP.  This requires developing software systems that can automatically capture, manage and analyze data generated by users interacting with the HMP modules and integrate this data and the knowledge bases for development of HMP Analytics modules.  This RFI focuses on steps that precede actual development or procurement, paying particular attention to needs for integrative technologies - especially standards, interoperability, protocols, and middleware - required for large-scale complex system design.

To create an HMP that is continually improving, the VA needs to be able to automatically collect and analyze usability data. Currently, collection of data regarding usability relies on time-consuming and ad-hoc manual and semi-automated techniques. Further, off-the-shelf usability software is limited by the need for manual review and screen scraping to generate data useful for usability analysis. Quality assessment techniques should be integrated within the infrastructure so that data can be directly captured throughout the care process. Moreover, HMP team members need access to automated tools to help analyze the data. 

It is anticipated that there will be diversity in terms of types of data and reports that are needed to support the diverse needs of HMP team members. For instance, administrators may require data on user satisfaction and workflow, researchers may want to study medical errors, and usability experts may be interested in User Interface (UI) efficiency (e.g., task completion rates). The software and tools suggested and/or specified should work seamlessly within actual clinical settings such as a scheduled clinic appointment or an inpatient assessment during attending rounds on a ward with automated data capture during real use of HMP tools.





Key functional specifications of the usability analytics platform include:

"	Interoperability with HMP application stack (e.g., Data Access Layer, Virtual Patient Record, Business Logic, User Interfaces) and data model.
"	Provision of near-time monitoring capabilities of HMP usage patterns integrating a variety of data sources including databases, Web tracking (e.g., HTTP client-server network traffic, and User Interface events like click-streams or gestures on mobile devices).
"	Predefined and custom segmentation and aggregation, dashboards and visualization for HMP activity at the level of individual clinicians, irrespective of location or workstation, at the level of care team (e.g. HMP activity during a 5 hour Emergency Room visit related to a patient) and at the level of individual patients and patient populations.
"	Provide advanced customization of variables, algorithms (e.g. segmentation, aggregation, and temporal data mining), reports, including visualization.
"	Support the ability to export the data. 
"	Configuration Management (accounts, web properties, profiles, goals, segments).
"	Collects and integrates user feedback and enables crowd-sourcing activities to aggregate feedback across users in a meaningful way. (Bugzilla, Google +1 votes, Amazon.com reviews with star ratings, feedback on users who provide reviews and helpfulness of the review, and Facebook likes are examples of user feedback solutions for commerce, rather than health care IT solutions.) 
"	Support for plug-ins and third-party solutions.
"	Provision of online developer guides and documentation of resources.

The scope of this effort is to provide information regarding: 
1.	Types of data needed to perform ongoing HMP usability analysis, including, for example, usage patterns and user interaction with the software.

2.	Characteristics of usability analytics platforms best suited for supporting HMP usability analytic methods (e.g., sequential task analysis).  Data collected by UAP can be combined with other data (e.g. field observations) to provide context. 

3.	Types of usability analytics visualization capabilities required for analyses and reporting of data (e.g., heat maps, time-series bubble charts, activity transition graphs).

4.	Specifications for an analytics infrastructure that captures and manages usability and usage information from within the HMP to guide continuous quality improvement in IT as well as clinical process improvement efforts

5.	Suggestions for existing available software, software layers, platforms and deployment models for enterprise architectures of up to 150+ facilities and 300,000 users.  

6.	Scalability and Interoperability of HMP Usability Analytics platform should be addressed with current electronic health record standards supporting the continuity of care delivery in a complex healthcare environment.


General information
"	HMP will be accessed through a variety of platforms, including tablet devices, smart phones, and traditional PCs.
"	The UAP will gather data from but, will not write data to, HMP.  The data collection must not slow down HMP performance.
"	The UAP will likely need to capture a variety of GUI events and store those events as timestamps with a series of related categorical variables, such as process type, specific process, specific event trigger, or other pre-determined categorical variables.  These categorical variables are actively being developed.
"	The UAP will meet federal data security and privacy requirements. 
"	The UAP will need to allow queries and statistical analyses to be programmed into the UAP system as metrics for repeated use.  If possible, these queries and analyses should be able to be easily shared across the 150+ VA medical facilities that may be involved in continual maintenance and modification of HMP.
"	The UAP will run reports on a near-real-time basis to allow for active monitoring of specific metrics for dashboards or statistical process control use cases.
"	The UAP will enable direct, integrated comparison between observed user behavior and expected user behavior at an arbitrary level of (sub-)task element, where expected user behavior could be based on a variety of sources and models, including (for example) GOMS models, cognitive architectures (e.g. ACT-R), empirical/statistical models of behavior, or simulation models (e.g. MicroSAINT).

APPENDIX 1:   CLINICAL USE CASE EXAMPLES

The UAP will be used to identify areas of the HMP that may not be meeting the needs of the end-users.  Metrics that have been determined to indicate possible poor/good usability will have thresholds to determine when to "red-flag" a specific metric.  Management, HMP developers, HMP local facility maintenance, continuous quality improvement (CQI), or other groups will monitor relevant metrics to determine when to deploy human resources to further investigate a potential GUI, workflow or feature shortcoming.

A Conceptual Example:
Consider a metric which concerns processes that result in binary outcomes, such as "OK" or "Cancel."  When prescribing a medication, once the medication ordering process has been initiated, only two outcomes are possible: (1) a medication order is entered or (2) the process is cancelled.  This metric is "red-flagged" when the medication ordering process is initiated more than twice without a medication order being entered.

"	Facility management:  Following a change to the medication formulary (medications available for order), facility management notices an increase in red flags associated with medication ordering.  Facility management knows that a formulary change was just made and decides to provide some additional reminders to clinicians concerning the formulary change.  Facility management continues to monitor medication ordering for the next 90 days to see if more resources should be deployed to finding out why end-users are having difficulty with the medication ordering process.

"	HMP developers:  HMP developers notice a spike in red flags concerning medication ordering across multiple sites.  HMP developers contact facility management at a few of the sites and do not uncover any reason for the increase in red flags, so HMP developers reach out to local systems redesign groups to investigate the medication ordering process.  The systems redesign groups find that a new set of hypertension guidelines require monitoring certain lab values and family history items during the ordering of most blood thinners.  The current HMP module must be cancelled in order to view those values, so HMP developers raise the priority of the medication ordering module and release a new version to allow the end-user to reference the needed laboratory information during the medication ordering process.

"	HMP local facility maintenance:  After pruning a redundant medication delivery method, HMP local facility maintenance notices an increase in red-flags for the medication ordering process.  HMP local facility maintenance immediately rolls back to the previous version and temporarily programs the redundant option to be routed as if the standardized option had been chosen.  HMP local facility maintenance then provides information to clinicians about the upcoming removal of the redundant option and rolls out the original update 4 weeks later when the end-users are prepared for the change.

"	CQI:  CQI is making changes to the medication ordering process locally and monitors the red-flags on the medication ordering process as various changes are piloted.  The red-flags are used as a "voice of the customer" measure along with the other performance measures to determine which process change is optimal.

APPENDIX 2 - EXAMPLES OF VISUAL ANALYTICS GENERATED FROM EHR USAGE DATA
Below are examples of analyses performed to study actual EHR usage within the VA. These analyses use off the shelf usability software for capturing EHR screen activity and associated mouse clicks that are then manually coded to specific EHR tasks. Visualizations were performed using statistical software.


 	 
Figure 1. EHR Mouse Activity per Visit. The number of mouse clicks is shown as the area of the disks, with absolute values displayed in the red legend. X Axis is EHR section (Not = Notes; Ord = Orders; Med = Medications; Lab = Labs; Rep = Reports; Con = Consults; Cov = Cover Sheet; Sig = Review/Sign; Oth = Other; Y-axis is Provider numbers (egg, "01," "02," etc.).	Figure 2. Sample chromogram displaying sequential tasks analysis. Graphic was generated from EHR mouse clicks that are color coded to EHR activity along the y-axis. The x-axis is time in minutes.

 
Figure 3. Example of EHR Activity Transition Graph. This is an example of an aggregate activity transition graph used to visualize EHR task transitions across multiple clinical visits. Nodes correspond to EHR activities (e.g. placing orders or viewing labs) and arcs correspond to observed transitions. Derived measures based on Transition Graphs, such as weighed node degree (the sum of all arc values in and out of a node) can quantify the "centrality" of a particular node. Another application of the analysis is to inform the identification of commonly co-occurring tasks, identification of abandoned tasks, and also circular transitions that may represent poor usability. 



?
Provider A (x visits)	 
Provider B (x visits)	
Figure 4. Heat map of Sequential Pattern Analysis (SPA) example. In Figure 3, we outline an example of a heat map obtained from the mouse-click data. The heat maps show patterns of EHR tasks and transition activity for 8 visits and 2 providers. Each of these 8 heat maps represents a 13 x 13 adjacency matrix. Along the X axis and the Y axis, each small square represents an EHR Task (e.g., F=Notes, E=Orders, D=Meds, J=Labs). Entries along the diagonal correspond to consecutive clicks within the same EHR Task (e.g. Notes'Notes). Off-diagonal entries correspond to transitions between EHR Tasks (e.g. Notes'Orders). The color of each small square represents the number of such transitions (red = >100, white = 0). This information can help identify the most frequent transitions between EHR screens or Task A and the degree of variability of transitions across visits. From the perspective of EHR UI efficiency and design, pairs of Tabs with highest frequency of transitions could be integrated into a single screen, thus minimizing inefficient navigation between screens. 


?
Meds
 	 
Labs 	 
Consults	 
Reminders	 
Figure 5. Order Entry Click Stream Analysis. These are stem and leaf plots where X-axis shows click stream sequence number (1= first order, 2= second and so forth), and the counts of each sequence denote CPO (Clicks Per Order) and total counts denote CPV (clicks per visit). These analyses can be done for various activities such as EHR order entry tasks for meds, labs, consults, imaging, or for satisfying alerts and reminders. In this example Sequential Task Analysis of EHR mouse activity is applied to quantify the burden of EHR order entry. It relies on capturing and manually coding individual mouse clicks, a process that can be automated by Usability Analytic Platform. Such click stream analyses are more detailed than window level coding, and can straddle activity across windows, and distinguishes several common categories of orders including Meds, Labs, Consults, Imaging, and Reminders. Key derived measures of EHR UI efficiency include Click Per Order (CPO) rate (i.e. number of mouse clicks per order). CPO can be interpreted as UI inefficiency, but also reflects the complexity of EHR workflow of specific orders. Such analysis can inform usability experts and software designers about the inefficiencies for specific order menus and help drive EHR redesign.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source contract with Golden Engineering, Inc., 6364 Means Road, Centerville, IN 47330. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 334519, Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing; the size standard is 750employees.</p>
<p>Improvised Explosives Devices (IEDs) are X-rayed by bomb technicians to determine how they are constructed and how to render them safe. Portable X-ray systems have been developed to X-ray these devices in place and in remote areas. These X-ray systems require an X-ray generator and an imaging system to then develop and process the X-ray image. X-ray generators purchased by the FBI need to be compatible with the bomb technician X-ray systems currently being used in the FBI. The generators need to be pulsed X-ray generators and not the commercial radiography X-ray generators that contain a radioactive source.</p>
<p>Golden Engineering Inc. is the only company in the United States that manufactures these portable bomb technician X-ray generators. The software used to process the X-ray images, X-ray Tool Kit (XTK), developed by Sandia National Laboratory, is based on the Golden Engineering Inc., generators. The Golden Engineering Inc. generators are the generators all bomb technicians in the United States are taught to use at HDS and are the only X-ray generators bomb technicians are certified to use.</p>
<p>Based on market research conducted and contacts made with knowledgeable individuals within the government and related industry, it has been determined the FBI's requirement for the required X-ray generators can only be provided by Golden Engineering Inc., as no other vendor is capable of providing the required X-ray generators to support the mission of the FBI.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals to this office by 08:00 am, EST, by Jan 10, 2013, by email to the attention of Jerry Varnell, Contract Specialist, at Jerry.Varnell@ic.fbi.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>The awardee shall be registered in the Central Contractor's Database (CCR) and also the Online Representations and Certification (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to GSI Environmental Incorporated to provide follow on services to validate shear-thinning delivery fluid technology through field demonstration.  The original project demonstrated and validated the use of shear-thinning delivery fluid for enhanced delivery of bioremediation amendments at a DoD site where chlorinated solvents are present. The project now plans to demonstrate that amendments can be delivered into lower permeability zones of a heterogeneous site using shear-thinning fluid enhanced delivery, quantify the increase in treatment efficiency in terms of the rate and extent of bioremediation for the targeted treatment zone, and determine the cost factors for applying the technology and compare those costs to baseline bioremediation practices.    GSI Environmental Incorporated is the best contractor for this effort because if another contractor were to perform the proposed follow on effort, there would be a substantial duplication of effort in order for the contractor to establish a field site, build up the supporting laboratory facilities, develop the proper project team, and collect and analyze information.  <br>    <br>  Objective of Scope of Work:   <br>  <br> Demonstrate that amendments can be delivered into the lower permeability zones of a heterogeneous site using shear-thinning fluid enhanced delivery; quantify the increase in treatment efficiency in terms of the rate and extend of bioremediation for the targeted treatment zone, particularly for the lower permeability zones, and the duration over which the fluid helps maintain suitable dechlorination conditions through diversion of competing electron acceptors and biodegradation of the shear-thinning agent, and determine the cost factors for applying the technology and compare these costs to baseline bioremediation practices. <br>  <br> This is a special notice prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   <br>  <br> However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting officer within fifteen (15) days of publication of this announcement.  Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will proceed with awarding a firm fixed price type contract to GSI Environmental Incorporated.   <br>  <br> Point of contact for this requirement is Nancy Hilleary at 703-428-6120 or nancy.l.hilleary@usace.army.mil    Address:  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, HECSA, 7701 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA  22315. <br>

<DESC>ERDC Contracting Office intends to solicit one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) to Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106-7015 for Research and Development services to consider improved approaches for quantifying contaminant bioavailability and exposures to different species of fish. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures --- this is a follow on contract so only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Case Western Reserve University is the only institution that has the required approaches and methods that have been approved by the Engineer Research and Development Center. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing or by email to the identified point of contact no later than Friday, 11 January 2013 - 11:00 A.M., CDST. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Interested parties must submit proposal for consideration by the Government to jamaya.smith@usace.army.mil. Please use solicitation number referenced in the subject line. <br>  <br> The Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Environmental Laboratory is coordinating research activities that consider improved approaches for quantifying contaminant bioavailability and exposures to different species of fish. The project will address a significant source of uncertainty in risk-based processes that model bioaccumulation potential by developing a more complete understanding of exposure variation among different benthic species caused by functional differences in how organisms interact with sediment particles, pore water and overlying water. The project will consider the functional ecology of infaunal macrobenthos in developing more accurate and ecologically relevant (and accurate) exposure assessments and predictions for remedial decision-making. This will support a critical research need in the area of  quote mark improved approaches for biological assessments of bioavailability quote mark .  <br>  <br> A series of laboratory experiments will be conducted to test the hypothesis that benthic functional attributes can explain differences in exposure, measured in terms of bioaccumulation, to different contaminant compartments within sediment.

<DESC>THERE ARE NO FUNDS AGAINST THE BAA SOLICITATION. The AFLCMC/XZC Development Planning (DP) organization is responsible for bridging warfighter identified capability needs to the planning for acquisition of future materiel solutions. AFLCMC/XZC seeks insight and comprehension of emerging technologies to assist in meeting its mission to evaluate technology gaps and risks with informed consideration of current and emerging technology projects in the areas of Command, Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C2ISR), and for cyber systems. Technology projects may include empirical research, test beds, and proof of concept demonstrations. This BAA is conducted using full and open competition. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this BAA is presumed to be 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees. Although no portion of this BAA has been set aside for small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, historically underutilized business zone businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and/or minority institutions, participation from all these organizations is highly encouraged. In an effort to minimize proposal preparation cost, this BAA utilizes a two-step process. The first step will be the submission of a concept paper. Offerors that submit concept papers that are consistent with the intent of the BAA, and are of interest to the government will be invited to submit a proposal (step two). Such an invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Instructions for the submission of concept papers and proposals are contained in the BAA. The submission of a concept paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal. Failure to follow this two-step process may preclude the chance for award. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA. Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scientific review process. A proposal's technical evaluation and its importance to agency programs, along with funding availability are primary basis for contract award. Cost reasonableness shall also be considered. Responses to this BAA are encouraged and sought within 30 days for each fiscal year's topics (see the attachment in the BAA). These initial papers will form the basis for timely discussions and planning of the fiscal year future studies. White papers/abstracts submitted after the 30 days will also be accepted under this BAA. The BAA technical areas of interest for the AFLCMC/XZC Development Planning research work are in the following topics: PCPAD, Cyber I &amp; W, cryptography, GBSD, AMTI sensing technology, mitigation of windfarm clutter, secure IP enabled airborne networks. All questions may be directed to the point of contact points listed in chapter two of this BAA.

PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>The Government will not be responsible for returning equipment with a full tank of gas or paying to refuel the equipment at the end of the Period of Performance. DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE. <BR> <BR>

Wherever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", ?vendor? or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price.

If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established six permanent regional offices in the following locations: Budapest, Hungary; San Jose, Costa Rica; Nairobi, Kenya; Dakar, Senegal; Pretoria, South Africa; and Bangkok, Thailand.  The sub regional offices are in Almaty, Kazakhstan, Jakarta, Indonesia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs) who report to the Disaster Response Team Leader in Washington. PRAs serve as the regional team leader for all response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. They primarily serve as the key interlocutor with embassies and missions in the event of a disaster but may also serve as the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) Leader if needed.  They are principally responsible for managing the regional offices, monitoring all grants on humanitarian assistance program implementation, overseeing the sub-regional offices, as appropriate, supervising the office staff, and developing, in consultation with their respective Washington-based Regional Coordinators , the multi-year non-response program strategies for their respective regions.  The PRAs coordinate with OFDA/Washington on disaster response activities, determine program priorities, and identify and formulate disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for their respective regions.  The Regional Advisors, who report to the PRAs, ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster response and assistance, strategic reporting and analysis, are met. The Regional Advisors are responsible for monitoring and reporting on OFDA-funded programs and activities, and assist the PRAs in formulating disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the region.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of a Regional Advisor (RA) in Dakar, Senegal, to ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster assistance, risk reduction, resilience programming, strategic reporting, and interagency coordination for the region, are met.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This Regional Advisor position requires an individual who is able to travel outside of the country where they are based, on short notice for two to three weeks at a time, or longer.  The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for on-going disaster activities related to disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs.  The incumbent will work to increase the capability of host governments, IOs and NGOs to respond and prepare for disasters in the affected region. The Regional Advisor will be responsible for disaster analysis, program monitoring, overseeing NGO partner implementation, reporting to OFDA Washington, and liaising with USAID Missions and U.S. Embassies.</p>
<p>A) Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the respective Principal Regional Advisor, the incumbent will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Travel to the scene of a disaster or potential disaster and assist in initial assessments of damages and needs; determine appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions, in consultation with OFDA/Washington and/or the Principal Regional Advisor; and provide timely reporting cables and other written analysis of these events;<br />&bull;	Coordinate and liaise with representatives of host governments, donor governments, IOs, NGOs, U.S. Embassies, and USAID Missions to facilitate cooperation and coordination in disaster response activities;<br />&bull;	Monitor DCHA/OFDA-funded activities and report in accordance with OFDA guidelines, policies, and requirements;<br />&bull;	Serve as DART Team Leader or as a DART team member during a disaster response, as required;<br />&bull;	Maintain regular communications with the regional (and/or sub-regional) office in their area of responsibility and with OFDA/Washington;<br />&bull;	Prepare specific requested field information and subject reports, as required by OFDA/Washington.<br /> <br />B) Disaster Preparedness - Working closely with OFDA/Washington and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the incumbent will assist representatives of host government organizations, IOs, and NGOs in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.</p>
<p>Specifically, the incumbent, in collaboration with OFDA regional/sub-regional team colleagues, will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance and response for OFDA, local governments, and other donors/organizations as appropriate;<br />&bull;	Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID and/or U.S. Embassy officials on OFDA's efforts in disaster response and management;<br />&bull;	Provide support for other OFDA initiatives in the assigned region as identified by the incumbent's respective Regional Office and/or sub-regional team.  Support may include, but is not limited to, assessment/evaluation visits, project design exercises and hazards/vulnerability/risk analysis;<br />&bull;	Coordinate with other agencies/organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting the region and countries and develop projects/activities for addressing these;<br />&bull;	Work with representatives of local and regional institutions and private/public sector organizations to incorporate preparedness and mitigation into appropriate programs;<br />&bull;	Prepare regular strategic and analytical reports on current or anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Regional Advisor will report directly to the Principal Regional Advisor for the region, or his/her designee. However, for certain activities, the Regional Advisor will coordinate tasks with the respective Team Leader in OFDA/Washington.<br /> <br />SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The Principal Regional Advisor will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives. The Regional Advisor is expected to act independently with little direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

No remanufactured products. <BR> <BR>Quotes will be evaluated based on price and delivery.  Price is the most important factor. <BR> <BR>In order to enhance the efficiency of the procurement process, the Government intends to evaluate only the lowest priced quote to determine if the quote is technically acceptable and whether the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance.  If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable and the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance, the Government intends to make an award to that vendor and no other quote will be evaluated.  If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability.  Quoter certifies that the product quoted meets or exceeds all minimum requirements as stated in the Request for Quotes. <BR> <BR>FAR 52.211-6 -- Brand Name or Equal is incorporated into this solicitation and any subsequent awards.

(d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an ?equal? product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price and total price.  Multiple awards will not be made; therefore, quotes that cover less than all the items and quantities in this quote will be rejected as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>The contract price includes all applicable Federal, state, and local taxes and duties. <BR> <BR>FOB Destination CONUS (Continental U.S.) <BR> <BR>Procedures for commercial vehicle access to military installations are varied.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract."

<p>================================================================</p>
<p>Unlisted classifications needed for work not included within<br />the scope of the classifications listed may be added after<br />award only as provided in the labor standards contract clauses<br />(29CFR 5.5 (a) (1) (ii)).</p>
<p><br />----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The body of each wage determination lists the classification<br />and wage rates that have been found to be prevailing for the<br />cited type(s) of construction in the area covered by the wage<br />determination. The classifications are listed in alphabetical<br />order of "identifiers" that indicate whether the particular<br />rate is union or non-union.</p>
<p><br />Union Identifiers</p>
<p>An identifier enclosed in dotted lines beginning with<br />characters other than "SU" denotes that the union<br />classification and rate have found to be prevailing for that<br />classification. Example: PLUM0198-005 07/01/2011. The<br />first four letters , PLUM, indicate the international union and<br />the four-digit number, 0198, that follows indicates the local<br />union number or district council number where applicable ,<br />i.e., Plumbers Local 0198. The next number, 005 in the<br />example, is an internal number used in processing the wage<br />determination. The date, 07/01/2011, following these<br />characters is the effective date of the most current<br />negotiated rate/collective bargaining agreement which would be<br />July 1, 2011 in the above example.</p>
<p>Union prevailing wage rates will be updated to reflect any<br />changes in the collective bargaining agreements governing the<br />rate.</p>
<p>0000/9999: weighted union wage rates will be published annually<br />each January.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-Union Identifiers</p>
<p>Classifications listed under an "SU" identifier were derived<br />from survey data by computing average rates and are not union<br />rates; however, the data used in computing these rates may<br />include both union and non-union data. Example: SULA2004-007<br />5/13/2010. SU indicates the rates are not union rates, LA<br />indicates the State of Louisiana; 2004 is the year of the<br />survey; and 007 is an internal number used in producing the<br />wage determination. A 1993 or later date, 5/13/2010, indicates<br />the classifications and rates under that identifier were issued<br />as a General Wage Determination on that date.</p>
<p>Survey wage rates will remain in effect and will not change<br />until a new survey is conducted.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS</p>
<p>1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can<br />be:</p>
<p>* an existing published wage determination<br />* a survey underlying a wage determination<br />* a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on<br />a wage determination matter<br />* a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling</p>
<p>On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests<br />for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour<br />Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted<br />because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the<br />Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial<br />contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)<br />and 3.) should be followed.</p>
<p>With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal<br />process described here, initial contact should be with the<br />Branch of Construction Wage Determinations. Write to:</p>
<p>Branch of Construction Wage Determinations<br />Wage and Hour Division<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an<br />interested party (those affected by the action) can request<br />review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator<br />(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:</p>
<p>Wage and Hour Administrator<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the<br />interested party's position and by any information (wage<br />payment data, project description, area practice material,<br />etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.</p>
<p>3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an<br />interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative<br />Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board). Write to:</p>
<p>Administrative Review Board<br />U.S. Department of Labor<br />200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20210</p>
<p>4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.</p>
<p>================================================================</p>
<p>END OF GENERAL DECISION</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

<DESC>Market Survey request for Violet Dye Blend   <br> Amendment 01: <br> The purpose of this Amendment 01 is to revise the market survey W15QKN-13-X-B0004 list  <br> of requirements for the Violet Dye Blend.  The specification for DB3 in the original attached  <br> Table 1 list of requirements was incorrect.  The original DB3 requirement was for 4% +/- 5%,  <br>  the correct requirement is for 4% +/- 1%.  The attached list of requirements reflects this <br>  change to DB3.   <br>  <br> Original Posting:  <br>  The U.S. Army, Army Contracting Command Center - New Jersey, Close Combat Center,   <br>  Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf of the Army Research Development and  <br>  Engineering Center (ARDEC), is conducting market research to identify potential producers,   <br>  capable of manufacturing VIOLET DYE BLEND per the requirements defined in the enclosed   <br>  Table I, below.  The dye will be used to manufacture smoke mix for the M18 Violet Smoke   <br>  Grenade (DODIC G955).

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) plans to seek proposals from small business firms for participation in Phase I of the Fiscal Year 2013 NOAA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program. Phase I of the SBIR program implements the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011, contained in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (P.L. 112-81), which reauthorizes the SBIR/STTR programs for six years. Small businesses are invited to submit research proposals in response to the Request for Proposals. <br /><br />The purpose of Phase I of the SBIR program is for firms to conduct research and development which will allow the Government to determine the scientific or technical merit and feasibility of concepts, ideas and quality of performance as a prerequisite for further Government support which may follow in Phase II of the program. Any organization or individuals receiving awards under Phase I are be eligible to compete for a Phase II award. The following are the NOAA, Research and Development (R&amp;D) topics available for Phase I: Weather-Ready Nation, Climate Adaptation and Mitigation, Healthy Oceans, Resilient Coastal Communities and Economies.<br /><br />The SBIR solicitation is being issued on January 4, 2013. The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541712. The SBIR solicitation will be available at the Federal Business Opportunities website www.fbo.gov. Please do not submit questions at this time. After release of the solicitation, it will be the offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for any amendments to the solicitation. The Government anticipates making multiple Phase I awards, each with a period of performance of six (6) months and a ceiling price not to exceed $95,000.00.<br /><br />The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office must be registered within the SAM.gov website (formerly the Central Contractor Registration [CCR] database). NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in SAM.gov. For additional information and to register in SAM, please access the following web site https://www.sam/gov and select the Help Tab. In order to register in SAM and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. A possible source of information for small businesses to use in helping to navigate these systems and learn more about contracting with the government is the Association of Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTAC). In 1985, Congress authorized the Procurement Technical Assistance Program in an effort to help expand the number of businesses capable of participating in the Government Marketplace. The program helps provide matching funds with state and local governments and non-profit organizations to establish these Procurement Technical Assistance Services to provide procurement assistance. They usually provide these service either at low cost or free of charge. You can find your local service center at http://www.aptac-us.org/new/Govt_Contracting/find.php to find out more information.<br /><br />General SBIR - related inquiries may be directed to the NOAA SBIR Program at (301) 713-3565, or SBIR@noaa.gov.

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor.

(2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer.

As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106?2?70, insert the following provision: Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Date) All solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13 must include provision 1352.213?70, Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures, or similar language setting out evaluation criteria.The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. <BR> <BR>Insert provision 1352.213?71, Instructions for Submitting Quotations under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold?Non-Commercial, or similar language in all solicitations for non-commercial purchase orders under the simplified acquisition threshold.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a sole source follow-on production contract to the Boeing Company for the production years FY15 through FY19 (Lots 3 through 7) P-8A Poseidon Aircraft. It is anticipated that this contract will be a five-year, fixed price type multiyear contract or multiple single year(s) if congressional multi-year contracting authority is not obtained. This procurement is for the manufacture of 72 aircraft (or other quantities as may be authorized and appropriated by Congress and/or for Foreign Military Sales) and related production support, to include special tooling and test equipment, systems engineering, production management, parts obsolescence, engineering change proposals and technical, administrative, and financial data. The Government plans to issue an Advance Acquisition Contract in FY14 for long-lead material and associated efforts supporting this procurement. In addition, the Government anticipates the procurement of integrated logistics support (FY15 through FY19), interim contractor support (FY15 through FY18), spares (FY15 through FY18), repair of repairables (FY15 through FY18), trainers (FY15 and FY16), support equipment (FY15 through FY19), and special mission A-kits and support requirements (FY15 through FY18) under separate contract actions. These requirements will be procured in accordance with the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition under Title 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." As the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the P-8A Aircraft, The Boeing Company is the only source that currently possesses sufficient requisite knowledge, engineering expertise, aircraft integration information, and technical data required to perform these efforts. No other source has the technical qualification and necessary resources to perform the work described herein, nor will any other supplies or services satisfy the Government's requirements. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact the following point of contact:

<CONTACT>Stacy Kirsch 202-781-5124 Joseph Tannenbaum 202-781-2629
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command is contemplating the procurement of the development, qualification, and delivery of the energy storage modules suitable for the DDG 51 Class Destroyer.  This announcement is made on behalf of PMS 320 (the Electric Ships Office).  These energy storage modules (ESMs) would apply to what a ship may need to enable operation of the electric plant on a single ship service gas turbine-generator set, mitigating the need for additional gas turbines to be running in operating reserve in case of a loss of power from the single operating gas turbine.  A draft specification has been released for industry comment as part of the announcement posted on May 3, 2012 to support the development of the procurement requirements.
  

A DRAFT solicitation is being released with this announcement for industry review and comment. Given that this is a draft, the dates included in the solicitation are completely arbitrary. The closing date of September 21st posted on NECO is the valid closing date. Additionally, an updated draft technical performance specification for the DDG 51 Flight I and Flight II ESM Production Hardware Development is now available by following the Technical Data Package (TDP) link on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online website, https://www.neco.navy.mil/ under solicitation number N0002412R4229.  The technical specification will be posted with restricted access controlling sensitive but unclassified document packages (limited to US DoD and US DoD contractors only) and recipients of this information must exercise good judgment on what parts of this technical information they deem necessary to share with suppliers who meet the requirements of the distribution statement.
  In addition to comments on the general content of the scope and technical requirements, a review of the requirements should include the identification of cost drivers, including rough estimates of cost impact, so the Navy may conduct a tradeoff analysis of performance versus cost drivers prior to releasing the final RFP.  It is not the intent of this announcement to solicit questions regarding these documents as formal responses will not be provided, but comments on the content that provide the basis for any recommended changes will be reviewed, with any conclusions manifest in the final competitive solicitation.  A competitive solicitation is planned to be issued shortly.  Should the content of the comments warrant, a separate announcement may be released to schedule one-on-one discussions with potential offerors and the Navy.
  The Navy will not release any comments/questions that have the potential to reveal a potential offeror's capabilities or business strategy.  This announcement in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies.  All information shall be provided free of charge to the Government.  No written responses will be returned.

This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) site at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) site at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.
  Offerors may utilize either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.  All inquiries should be emailed to stacy.cooper@navy.mil.

The DBMS may be executed either locally with a desktop installation (Desktop DBMS) to upload and analyze project specific data, or using the GSA application portal (Site-Wide DBMS) via the internet for verification of project-specific data deliverables and for analysis and reporting of site-wide RFI data. The DBMS is propitiatory code and is being made available to responders for use to respond to this effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Access to the DBMS and will be granted upon award of specific projects. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Use of this program on any projects other than those required by GSA is prohibited.</p>

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
VA246-13-R-0233

NOTE:  All answers are in bold


1.	We plan to submit packages for multiple A/E requirements at the VA Medical Center in Salisbury, NC.  Do we need to submit binders for each project or can we bundle them into one submission and use separate cover sheets?

I will require separate binders for each project in the case that we have multiple review teams looking at the proposals.  I also do not want to have to be concerned about trying to decipher who submitted what for which project.  With binders coming in for each individual project, there will be no question as to what was intended.

2.	The solicitation does not specifically request past performance to be provided for the Prime SDVOSB. As there have recently been many upheld protests on SDVOSB firms passing through work, would it be better to require some of the past performances to be from the Prime SDBOSB firm?

Qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on criteria to include past performance.  Only packages received from a prime firm would be evaluated.  Page 3 of the sources sought notice states that "the past performance of the firm" will be evaluated.  This would imply the prime firm.

3.	It is required that we submit an SF330, as well as the supplemental information. Much of the information being asked in the supplemental information seems to mimic the information that will be part of the SF330. For example, in 1. Professional qualification asks for resumes. Those are also required as part of the SF330. Do we need to submit the same information twice?

Section E of the SF330 does cover resumes of key personnel.  If you are confident that Section E of your SF330 covers all of the information required for the supplemental information (personal resumes), you can notate the attachment and refer us back to the SF330.  The supplemental requirement allows for up to 2 pages for each resume, which may allow for an expansion of the information provided on the SF330, if there is additional information that you want to highlight.

4.	In 1. Professional qualification can you further detail what the "summary disclosure" is?  

Disregard the requirement for a "summary disclosure".

5.	In 1. Professional qualification there is a page limit on the "resume package"; does this mean each individuals resume, or the resume plus disclosure for the whole team combined?  

Each individual resume package.

6.	The SF330 requires up to 10 projects to be submitted in Part E. The supplemental information 2. Specialized Experience requests no more than 3 projects to be submitted. Should these be the same projects and is it required to submit the same information in both areas?  
It is up to you whether or not you want to use 3 of the same projects that were shown on the SF330.  If you do, then choose the 3 projects that best highlight the specialized experience that would be needed for the project in question.  And yes, please submit the same information in both areas.
7.	Supplemental information requires 4. Past performance on up to 3 projects used as "relevant experience".  Can this be for any of the projects submitted in the SF330 Part F?  

Yes

8.	Supplemental information 5. Location identifies a response time, would you provide information as to what meets this definition, i.e.: the project manager being on site, the construction observation staff or a member of the design team?  

Response time is defined as a physical presence at this medical center via automobile (not corporate or commercial aircraft, nor Amtrak).  And it refers to any member of the project team.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
VA246-13-R-0236

NOTE:  All answers are in bold


1.	We plan to submit packages for multiple A/E requirements at the VA Medical Center in Salisbury, NC.  Do we need to submit binders for each project or can we bundle them into one submission and use separate cover sheets?

I will require separate binders for each project in the case that we have multiple review teams looking at the proposals.  I also do not want to have to be concerned about trying to decipher who submitted what for which project.  With binders coming in for each individual project, there will be no question as to what was intended.

2.	The solicitation does not specifically request past performance to be provided for the Prime SDVOSB. As there have recently been many upheld protests on SDVOSB firms passing through work, would it be better to require some of the past performances to be from the Prime SDBOSB firm?

Qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on criteria to include past performance.  Only packages received from a prime firm would be evaluated.  Page 3 of the sources sought notice states that "the past performance of the firm" will be evaluated.  This would imply the prime firm.

3.	It is required that we submit an SF330, as well as the supplemental information. Much of the information being asked in the supplemental information seems to mimic the information that will be part of the SF330. For example, in 1. Professional qualification asks for resumes. Those are also required as part of the SF330. Do we need to submit the same information twice?

Section E of the SF330 does cover resumes of key personnel.  If you are confident that Section E of your SF330 covers all of the information required for the supplemental information (personal resumes), you can notate the attachment and refer us back to the SF330.  The supplemental requirement allows for up to 2 pages for each resume, which may allow for an expansion of the information provided on the SF330, if there is additional information that you want to highlight.

4.	In 1. Professional qualification can you further detail what the "summary disclosure" is?  

Disregard the requirement for a "summary disclosure".

5.	In 1. Professional qualification there is a page limit on the "resume package"; does this mean each individuals resume, or the resume plus disclosure for the whole team combined?  

Each individual resume package.

6.	The SF330 requires up to 10 projects to be submitted in Part E. The supplemental information 2. Specialized Experience requests no more than 3 projects to be submitted. Should these be the same projects and is it required to submit the same information in both areas?  
It is up to you whether or not you want to use 3 of the same projects that were shown on the SF330.  If you do, then choose the 3 projects that best highlight the specialized experience that would be needed for the project in question.  And yes, please submit the same information in both areas.
7.	Supplemental information requires 4. Past performance on up to 3 projects used as "relevant experience".  Can this be for any of the projects submitted in the SF330 Part F?  

Yes

8.	Supplemental information 5. Location identifies a response time, would you provide information as to what meets this definition, i.e.: the project manager being on site, the construction observation staff or a member of the design team?  

Response time is defined as a physical presence at this medical center via automobile (not corporate or commercial aircraft, nor Amtrak).  And it refers to any member of the project team.

<DESC>To be eligible for the ESRD contract, an organization must demonstrate how their organization will accomplish the goals of the contract requirements to improve health and healthcare for all Medicare beneficiaries and in support of achieving national quality improvement goals and statutory requirements as set forth in Section 1881 of the Social Security Act and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986. The tasks described in the SOW are intended to align Network activities with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) National Quality Strategy (NQS), the CMS Three Aims, and other CMS priorities designed to result in improvements in the care of individuals with ESRD.
<p>The&nbsp;SOW shall promote positive change relative to three AIMs outlined in the NQS and CMS priorities. The AIMs are interpreted for purposes of this SOW as:</p>
<p>AIM 1: Better Care for the Individual through Beneficiary and Family Centered Care<br />AIM 2: Better Health for the ESRD Population <br />AIM 3: Reduce Costs of ESRD Care by Improving Care.</p>
<p>The three AIMS are subdivided into multiple domains, as defined in this SOW. Many factors influence these domains, including patient characteristics, patients' social support/environment, and aspects of the health care delivery system. To substantively impact these domains, the Network may need to deploy interventions that target patients, dialysis/transplant providers, other providers, and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>The Network's are also required to incorporate a focus on disparities in conducting all of the activities outlined in this SOW. In each domain, the Network shall analyze data and implement interventions aimed at reducing disparities.</p>
