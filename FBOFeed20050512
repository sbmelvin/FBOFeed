<DESC>The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP),  Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration , Department of Health and Human Services contemplates awarding a one year cost reimbursement contract with four option years entitled Data Coordination and Consolidation Center (DCCC).  The Offerors who propose on this project must be aware that this project will require substantial subcontracting opportunities to small businesses. 

The purpose of this requirement is to establish the Data Coordination and Consolidation Center as the primary data collection and analysis for State Prevention National Outcomes Measures reporting.  The goal of this project is develop and implement a set of web-based tools to 1) provide a data collection, storage, analysis and reporting center for CSAP program activities, to include collection and reporting of SAMHSA’s National Outcome Measures (NOMs);  2) provide training and technical assistance to the prevention and other professional users on SAMHSA’s Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF), to promote consistency in understanding and implementation of the SPF. For this contract, the Offeror will create these tools within existing CSAP web-based resources to maximize the efficiency of product delivery.  The technological aspects of this contract require that the web-based tools are user-friendly and that they accurately communicate the requirements of CSAP and SAMHSA around the SPF and the NOMs.  The user-friendliness is critical to ensure that the implementation of the SPF produces quality planning and service processes in the prevention field, and that the field can access training and TA to aid in this implementation.  Accuracy is critical to ensure that, as states and communities engage in these planning and service processes, they can produce and deliver high quality data for federal reporting requirements. This contract will assume the responsibility for reporting state and community data to CSAP and SAMHSA in timely and easy-to-read formats to help federal staff in assessing substance use trends and effectiveness of CSAP funding.  The contract will require participation in national, regional and state  workshops and conferences, and the organization  of these events as needed, to ensure understanding and use of the web-based tools by relevant audiences.  The Offeror must comply with, and assist the government in completion of, all required federal processes, such as OMB clearances, preparation of ad hoc and standard reports and presentation materials, and management of the project.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Montana Division Office plans to award a purchase order to the Western Transportation Institute (WTI) of the University of Montana to develop a consensus-based, defensible and appropriate ecosystem oriented approach to integrated compensatory mitigation of highway impacts to ecosystems and wildlife populations, benefits, and values in the vicinity of the US Highway 93 Corridor.  This will serve as a pilot for an ecosystem approach to mitigation on US Highway 93.  The WTI is the only known source that has knowledge of the area, the issues, and the resource personnel required to complete this project.  The WTI has been working with the Montana Department of Transportation as well as the FHWA on wildlife crossing research in the US 93 Corridor.  Furthermore, WTI has developed the ARTEMIS database, which is the most complete reference resource, focused on animal-vehicle collisions and mitigation options for impacts of highways on ecosystems in North America.  Furthermore, one of the core program focus areas at WTI is transportation system-wildlife interaction.  There is no other known source that possesses this combined experience and knowledge which is so very important to the completion of this project. The FHWA contact for this requirement is Scott Swarens, telephone number 406-449-5302.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is on or about May 26, 2005.

A number of commercial vendors, responding to the marketplace for security systems, have begun to provide increasing sophisticated interpretation algorithms with their CCTV systems.  Over more than a decade, the Department of Defense has had a major development emphasis on developing the capability for total battlespace awareness.

Offerors may propose stepladder quantity pricing,  (e.g., 1 - 10, $xx; 11-20, $xx).  However, the price will be evaluated on a quantity of 5 units. Federal Acquisition Regulation-52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, (Jan 2004): Multiple Offers are discouraged.  Offerors shall submit a combined technical/business proposal.   An original and one (1) copy of the proposal are required and can be submitted via CD ROM.   Proposals shall be prepared using "Arial" or "Times New Roman" 11-point font style on 8 1/2 x 11 inch white paper.  Tables and illustrations may use a reduced font style, not less than 8 points.  Foldouts are not allowed.  All material submitted may be single-spaced.  Offerors should ensure that each page provides identification of the submitting Offeror in the header or footer.  Page count for the combined technical/business proposal shall not exceed 5 total pages, inclusive of product literature.  Sealed offers for the items to be provided shall be hand-carried or express mailed via UPS or Federal Express to the following location by 2:00PM (EST) 27 May 2005: COMMANDER, Attn: Ms.Stefanie C! onway, CTQ, MARCORSYSCOM, 2200 Lester Street, VA, 22314-5010.  NOTE: Offerors are advised that proposals sent by conventional US Mail service are not routed directly to the above address.  FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999).  Evaluation Factors:  Operational Effectiveness - Describe your ability to currently meet the performance requirements stated in this purchase description and address your technical data and life cycle support strategy.  Ensure that your stated response addresses overall product compatibility, as well as any additional parameters not specifically cited in the purchase description.  Address any specific commercial or extended warranty provisions for the resulting product.  Past Performance - Provide specific examples of favorable recent past performance that illustrates evidence of your ability to produce, deliver, and warrant your product.  Ensure the past performance information includes names of technical and contracting officials, tel! ephone numbers, addresses, e-mail, name of the product purchased, quantities, dates of the resulting contract, contract value, contract number and a description of the items procured.  Relative Order of Importance:   (i) Operational Effectiveness - Most important. (ii) Past Performance - Less important.  Price will be evaluated, but not rated.  Award shall be made to the offeror whose proposal presents the best value to the government.  In making its "Best Value" determination, the Government will consider overall operational effectiveness and past performance merit to be of significantly greater importance than evaluated price.  However, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination will increase with the degree of equality in the overall merits of the proposals.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contrac! t without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations.  FAR Clauses: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your inform! ation online as a part of the proposal evaluation process.  You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be ! asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help).  52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5! ,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer -- Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds.  52.247-34, F.O.B.

<DESC>1.	The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Special Communications Requirements (SCR) Division, Patuxent River, St. Inigoes, MD has a requirement for 12 TC-150MAmplifiers and 2 Bias T in support of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Joint Base Station (JBS) Variant (V2) D Naval Special Warfare (NSW), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), and United States Army special Operations Command (USASOC) Supplemental Build Projects.   Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(ii),  the Government intends to procure these items sole source thru Talla-Com Industries.   Talla-Com is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the TC-150M amplifier and B-20D Bias T.  Only Talla-Com’s TC-150M amplifiers were found to meet all of the JBS  technical and logistical requirements for use with the JBS System; particularly in regards to functioning as a lightweight, robust and versatile multi-band amplifier to include 30 to 512MHz frequency coverage, selectable output power, 150W DAMA/SATCOM compliance, operator selectable, Joint Test Interoperability Command (JTIC) certification, and an RF interface that supports multiple wave forms.  The Talla-Com Bias T is also able to meet all of the JBS requirements. The Bias T will be used in conjunction with the Talla-Com TC-150M amplifier, which will allow the amplifier to be placed near the antenna without a separate DC cable harness.  If an alternative vendor is selected for this requirement, the Government will incur significant, unrecoverable costs due to nonrecurring engineering efforts.  The required delivery date for this effort is anticipated to be 02 March 2006 to NAWCAD, Webster Field, St. Ingoes, MD 20684.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL (NSWC PC) intends to award a sole source contract to Comark Corporation of Bloomingdale, IL for twenty (20) serial interface units for the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Vehicle was first delivered in 1984 and had a service-life design of 20 years. Currently, the Navy has a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for the LCAC.  Under SLEP, the LCAC will enter the 21st century with markedly improved performance and an increased life span.  The Serial Interface Units utilized on the craft were specifically designed by Comark Corporation and are the only Serial Interface Units that are 100% compatible with the existing LCAC equipment.  Use of another company’s Serial Interface Units may introduce new or change existing parameters that may do m! ore harm than good to the LCAC system.  Therefore the COMARK Corporation is the only known source for these items. Delivery will be the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. NAICS Code 334111 applies. SBA Size Standard is 1000 employees. FSC is 7050.

<DESC>The FERC intends to acquire services on a sole source basis from Felix Yokel, Bethesda, MD.  Mr. Yokel will conduct both pre-certificate and post-certificate seismic hazard evaluation and seismic design reviews of various jurisdictional liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), Office of Energy Projects. Such reviews are necessary to determine the overall adequacy of the proposed seismic design philosophy and input values, tank and foundation engineering with respect to earthquake loads, hydrostatic test on LNG storage tanks, hazard detection and control systems, and LNG spill containment. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.1. The period of performance will begin approximately July 1, 2005 through September 30, 2005, with two one-year option periods. The resultant contract will be fixed price.  It is estimated that three inspections will take place per year.  Interested persons may forward their interest and capability to the referenced address within 15 days after the date of publication of this Notice.  Capability forwarded will include and demonstrate that the interested firm has retained a lead engineer who has the background requirements of 15 years of recent earthquake engineering services on at least 5 LNG facilities.  Interested firms must be thoroughly familiar with U.S. Department of Transportation’s Seismic Design Requirements for LNG Facilities. Please forward interest and capability to Charlotte Handley at charlotte.handley@ferc.gov. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by the response date will be considered by the FERC. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the FERC. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Metastorm e-Work Insight
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-SSA-RFQ-05-1416
<RESPDATE>052305
<ARCHDATE>06072005
<CONTACT>Kathy Fain, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-965-4853, Fax 410-965-9560, Email kathryn.fain@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Metastorm, 8825 Stanford Blvd, Suite 200, Columbia, MD 21045-4757, under the authority (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) “Soliciting from a Single Source” for the purchase of Metastorm’s business intelligence module, called “e-Work Insight”.  SSA’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) is currently using other Metastorm’s e-work Business Process Management (BPM) software suite as the basis of its National Investigative Case Management System. (NICMS).    The NICMS is used by SSA to track detailed information pertaining to allegations and cases of fraud, waste and abuse in Social Security Administration programs.  NICMS is used by approximately 500 OIG personnel to create and store records/files, obtain queries, perform case analysis, and generate reports from a centralized database containing investigative information.  NICMS was developed in the fall of 2004 using the Metastorm e-Business Management Tool.  At the time of selection, no BPM tool was known to the government that could create the extensive reports required of SSA’s OIG.  SSA had tried to use another company’s existing standard reporting tool in conjunction with the Metastorm BPM software, but that proved to be a complicated and involved process, only achieved with extensive interface coding.  By purchasing Metastorm  e-Work Insight, SSA will be able to leverage the development already completed on existing reports, and will eliminate the extensive coding required to integrate future reports into the existing Metastorm tool.  Therefore, SSA now intends to add the e-Work Insight component to the NICMS application, as an additional fully integrated component of Metastorm’s Business Process Management (BPM) software suite currently in use at SSA.  Since Insight can be accessed from Metastorm’s existing process management portal, currently in use, the full set of business intelligence capabilities in e-Work Insight can be linked directly to the Metastorm process database already in use, allowing SSA OIG to leverage its capabilities immediately against their existing processes and databases. 







The anticipated Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) descriptions, and quantities are as follows:  CLIN 0001 e-Work Insight  standard server, QTY: 1 (one), FOB Destination, within 3 days after contract award; CLIN 0002 e-Work Insight Maintenance for CLIN 0001, from date of award through 8/31/05 QTY: 1 (one).  CLIN 0003 e-Work Insight Dev/Test Ser-SS, QTY: 1(one), FOB Destination, within 3 days after contract award; CLIN 0004 e-Work Insight Maintenance for CLIN 0003, from date of award through 8/31/05 QTY: 1(one). The place of performance shall be SSA headquarters, Baltimore, Maryland. Delivery is FOB destination. The code used in e-work Insight is proprietary, and no resellers are authorized.  Metastorm is the only authorized dealer of the e-Work Insight product, and the only source known to the Government.    The government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price purchase order.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bonafide capability to fulfill this requirement.  A solicitation is NOT available.  Therefore, written and/or verbal requests for copies of a solicitation related to this announcement will not be honored.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This solicitation is a formal request for proposal (RFP) for multiple NSNs in FSC 6850 and 9150.  It is anticipated that split awards may be made.  The resultant contract(s) will be firm fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity type contract(s) with a two-year base period and three one-year option periods. 

Evaluation:  Groupings of NSNs (like items) have been identified consisting of individual line items. Contractors may quote on entire groups or on as many NSNs as they have the capability to perform.

Assuming that one or more offer is received for each group, the contract specialist will evaluate the offers on the basis of the Total Group Price (TGP).  The TGP is the sum of the individual line item prices for the total contract period.  The individual line item price is the sum of the unit price multiplied by the estimated annual demand quantity for each contract period.  The evaluated price will also include any other price evaluation factors identified elsewhere in the solicitation (e.g. first article costs).

The items included in this solicitation shall be manufactured in accordance with Government technical data packages, and specifications.  Technical data can be obtained using a combination of the websites found below.  Access to the websites may require registration.  Contractors are strongly encouraged to register prior to release of the solicitation if they have not already done so.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a requirement for the services of a contractor to evaluate Youth Transition Demonstration (YTD) Projects.  In order to better understand how to support individuals with disabilities in reaching their full economic potential, SSA has initiated a multi-faceted research agenda to test strategies to best identify how individuals with disabilities can become self-sufficient and less reliant on SSI/CDB benefits.  SSA has awarded cooperative agreements to seven project sites in six states to begin this work.  These projects will work with youth aged 14-25 who receive SSI, or Childhood Disability Benefits and those at risk of receiving such benefits, including those who have a progressive disability, who have a prognosis for decreased functioning, or who have existing disabling conditions prior to age 18 that would make them eligible for benefits except for deemed parental income.  SSA awarded a contract for technical assistance (TA) and training (Virginia Commonwealth University - VCU) to be provided to the YTD Cooperative Agreement grantees.  The evaluation contractor shall work with the TA contractor to closely monitor the progress of the development and implementation of changes in the interventions in order to provide feedback and recommendations for corrective action, and maintain project work plan goals and time lines.  Through this requirement for evaluation, SSA will develop and evaluate strategies that maximize the economic self-sufficiency of youth with disabilities as they transition from school to work.  This research will generate empirical evidence, based on both process and random-assignment evaluations, on the impacts of SSI waivers and enhanced coordination of services for youth with disabilities.  Under this project, SSA will test the effectiveness of altering certain SSI rules as an incentive to encourage recipients with disabilities or blindness to initiate work or increase their work activity and to increase their earnings.  The evaluation design of these YTD strategies will include a process evaluation of all existing and additional project sites involved, and will yield important information in understanding how to assist youth in the transition process.  In addition, those sites who are interested in random assignment will also participate in an impact analysis.  The contractor shall conduct full implementation/process evaluations with each project site involved in the project, and based upon the development of each project site, move forward with a random assignment design at specified locations, in order to determine the impacts of each program.  The evaluation will measure the impacts of SSI waivers and enhanced coordination services intended to promote the economic self-sufficiency of youth with disabilities, and will test overall strategies to improving the employment, educational, school and income outcomes of youth with disabilities as they transition from school to work.   The three components of this evaluation include a process, impact, and cost-benefit analysis.  The evaluation contractor will work with the existing seven YTD project sites, as well as recommend 2 – 4 additional sites through this contract mechanism.  The responsibilities of the YTD Evaluation Contractor shall include: 1) recommendation of 2 – 4 additional sites through visits, marketing the project, and technical assistance; 2) providing technical assistance to sites on evaluation design, strategy, and implementation; coordinating with national technical assistance contractor (VCU); 3) monitoring pilot tests on project sites; 4) assisting in final site selection for evaluation sites; 5) developing and implementing final evaluation design; 6) convening conferences and meetings in conjunction with the TA contractor; 7) collecting administrative and program intervention data; 8) developing and administering surveys; 9) conducting a process and impact study of program findings; 10) conducting a cost benefit analysis of the project; 11) producing research and analysis on special topics relating  to the project; 12) producing public use data files and documentation; disseminating findings and conducting briefings; and 13) producing reports.  SSA anticipates awarding a cost reimbursement contract with a nine (9) year period of performance.  The NAICS code is 624110, with a size standard of $6 million.  Solicitation number SSA-RFP-05-1025, is scheduled for release on or about March 11, 2005.  The solicitation will be available for downloading from the Federal Procurement website at www.fedbizopps.gov.  HARD COPIES OF THE RFP WILL NOT BE MAILED.  Telephone requests will not be honored and no bidders list will be maintained.  Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the FedBizOpps website to check the status of this requirement and to keep current with any amendments that may be issued.  Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  All questions must be submitted via email to barbara.hands@ssa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The ACA, Southern Region, Fort Stewart Contracting, Georgia is seeking interest from Small Business HubZone firms and 8(a) participants with bona-fide places of business in the southeast Georgia area. The Army is targeting the issuance of approximate ly ten (10) Basic Ordering Agreement's (BOA's). The estimated period of performance will be three (3) years with the Government reserving the right to grant extensions for up to two years, with no single extension exceeding one year in accordance with DFAR S 216.703(c). BOA's are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the HubZone and 8(a) program serviced by the US Small Business Administration (SBA) Atlanta district office. The BOA is not a contract but a written ins trument of understanding negotiated between Fort Stewart (Army) and the HubZone/8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The BOA holders will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms a nd conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA, and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order. On an annual basis, the ARMY will review the continued need for thi s agreement in light of (a) the usefulness and need for service, and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. When the ARMY has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specification s, or in some cases a design concept only, to the BOA holders for submission of a proposal. If the parties are able to come to an agreement, a contractual document, i.e. task order, will be issued and the BOA holder will be required to furnish the necessar y personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the task order, as directed by the Contracting Officer. Competition for the BOA task orders shall be restricted to the BOA holders in the SBA District noted. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement, but there is a threshold minimum of not less than $2,500.00 that can be placed on a task order with a maximum of $3, 000,000.00. The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, will consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over  $100,000.00 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order over $25,000.00. There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the ARMY to place future contracts  or orders with the BOA holder or to require that the ARMY solicit and acquire services from he BOA holders only. DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The anticipated work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks. Covered work includes, but is not lim ited to, the following types.

GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers m ilitary installations Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia.  The agreements will be written for a period of three (3) years. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. IF a f irm is graduating from the 8(a) program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the BOA holder and the BOA will terminate. Termination of the BOA under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders pr eviously issued. Either party may cancel the BOA with 30 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued orders. The BOA holders may be required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for ARMY approval as well as a price proposal. SOLICITATIONS: A solicitation will be issued for each requirement to indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror. The Government reser ves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown at any time. ORDERS: Individual projects will be awarded using the DD Form 1155 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time .

It has been determined that foreign companies will not be  permitted to participate in this acquisition at the prime contract level.   Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics  Services Center (DLSC) +http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/+ and have a legitimate  business purpose may participate in this solicitation. Contact the Defense  Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan  40917-3084 (1-800-352-3572) for further information on the certification  process. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military  Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your proposal. REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION: We anticipate award of a Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD)  contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for  a Lead System Integrator in the July 2005 timeframe.  This Lead System  Integrator must possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to be Lead  System Integrator of the B-52 SOJ component of the Airborne Electronic Attack  (AEA) System of Systems (SoS) for use by United States Air Force (USAF)  personnel.  The nature of this effort will require access to SECRET or higher  and NOFORN material.   Background The B-52 SOJ will be a core component of the AEA System of Systems.  Other key  AEA components are anticipated to include a jammer variant of the Miniature  Air Launched Decoy (MALD), EC-130H with enhanced jamming pods (Compass Call),  inherent EA capability of Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESA) on board  F/A-22s, F-35s, and other AESA-equipped aircraft, the Navy+s EA-6B Improved  Capability III (ICAP III) and EA-18G, and the network/protocols to link these  capabilities.  Some of the key technologies that will be involved include, but  are not limited to: sensitive accurate direction finding Radio Frequency (RF)  receivers, high power relatively broad band directional RF transmitters,  appropriate command and control and on-scene (local) electronic attack (EA)  asset management functions, line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight networking,  and advanced electronic warfare techniques generation and integration.  A  detailed overview of the B-52 SOJ will be presented at the B-52 Stand-off  Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson AFB on 16 –  17 Feb 2005.  Additional information for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will  be added to this site as soon as possible.  Further data can be obtained from  the points of contact listed at the bottom of this announcement. Current Environment Concept refinement of the AEA SoS and, in turn, B-52 SOJ, is in process.  An  AEA Analysis of Alternatives was completed in 2001 and forms the basis for  overall AEA capability requirements.  An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)  for AEA was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in Nov 2004.   The B-52H, in its fourth decade of operational service, provides the country  with immediate nuclear and conventional global power projection. There are  presently 93 aircraft in service, operating from two Main Operating Bases  (Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB) with the exception of two stationed at Edwards  AFB for flight testing.  Several modifications are underway or planned for the  B-52H to increase or sustain its capabilities.  A key requirement of the SOJ  is that it shall not degrade any current capabilities on the B-52H.  In  addition, the SOJ design and modification will need to be integrated with  other on-going B-52H modifications.   Contract Descriptions The objective for award of the pre-SDD contract is fourth quarter FY05.   The  approximately 2-year period of performance would include identifying and  evaluating existing technologies and associated suppliers needed to meet SOJ  requirements; reducing the risk or developing a plan for managing the risk  associated with those technologies in SDD; assisting the Air Force in planning  for SDD (including developing spiral development strategies, if applicable)  and accomplishing B-52 SOJ Milestone B (approval for entry into the SDD  phase), and other related tasks.   The Lead System Integrator will be expected to develop and execute a best  value strategy to manage the risks associated with selecting, integrating, and  sustaining SOJ components of varying technological maturity into a cohesive,  scalable/expandable B-52 subsystem.  The Government will require insight into  the integrating contractor’s subcontract and vendor selection process and  decision methodology.  The integrating contractor will be expected to execute,  in partnership with the Air Force, a robust systems engineering process that  includes subcontractors and vendors and to perform all planning necessary to  be able to field and sustain the SOJ capability following its development.   The SOJ capability will complement and shall not degrade the aircraft’s strike  (both nuclear and non-nuclear) capabilities.  Full weapons carriage capability  shall be maintained.  Lastly, it is recognized that because of the B-52  experience and expertise that the Boeing Co. (the B-52 OEM) has built up over  the years, that its involvement will be necessary.  Thus, the Lead System  Integrator will be expected to interface with the Boeing Company or provide a  realistic plan describing how the bidder would accomplish the objectives of  the program without a Boeing interface.

This announcement is being posted to provide information about the  program to prospective bidders.  Questions may be submitted to the points of  contact listed at the bottom of this announcement.  We will update this  announcement by posting the questions and our responses in a Bidders Library  that will be placed at the end of this announcement.  This acquisition involves data that are subject to export control laws and  regulations.  It has been determined that foreign companies will not be  permitted to participate in this acquisition at the prime contract level.   Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics  Services Center (DLSC) +http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/+ and have a legitimate  business purpose may participate in this solicitation. Contact the Defense  Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan  40917-3084 (1-800-352-3572) for further information on the certification  process. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military  Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your proposal. REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION: We anticipate award of a Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD)  contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for  a Lead System Integrator in the July 2005 timeframe.  This Lead System  Integrator must possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to be Lead  System Integrator of the B-52 SOJ component of the Airborne Electronic Attack  (AEA) System of Systems (SoS) for use by United States Air Force (USAF)  personnel.  The nature of this effort will require access to SECRET or higher  and NOFORN material.   Background The B-52 SOJ will be a core component of the AEA System of Systems.  Other key  AEA components are anticipated to include a jammer variant of the Miniature  Air Launched Decoy (MALD), EC-130H with enhanced jamming pods (Compass Call),  inherent EA capability of Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESA) on board  F/A-22s, F-35s, and other AESA-equipped aircraft, the Navy+s EA-6B Improved  Capability III (ICAP III) and EA-18G, and the network/protocols to link these  capabilities.  Some of the key technologies that will be involved include, but  are not limited to: sensitive accurate direction finding Radio Frequency (RF)  receivers, high power relatively broad band directional RF transmitters,  appropriate command and control and on-scene (local) electronic attack (EA)  asset management functions, line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight networking,  and advanced electronic warfare techniques generation and integration.  A  detailed overview of the B-52 SOJ will be presented at the B-52 Stand-off  Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson AFB on 16 –  17 Feb 2005.  Additional information for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will  be added to this site as soon as possible.  Further data can be obtained from  the points of contact listed at the bottom of this announcement. Current Environment Concept refinement of the AEA SoS and, in turn, B-52 SOJ, is in process.  An  AEA Analysis of Alternatives was completed in 2001 and forms the basis for  overall AEA capability requirements.  An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)  for AEA was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in Nov 2004.   The B-52H, in its fourth decade of operational service, provides the country  with immediate nuclear and conventional global power projection. There are  presently 93 aircraft in service, operating from two Main Operating Bases  (Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB) with the exception of two stationed at Edwards  AFB for flight testing.  Several modifications are underway or planned for the  B-52H to increase or sustain its capabilities.  A key requirement of the SOJ  is that it shall not degrade any current capabilities on the B-52H.  In  addition, the SOJ design and modification will need to be integrated with  other on-going B-52H modifications.   Contract Descriptions The objective for award of the pre-SDD contract is fourth quarter FY05.   The  approximately 2-year period of performance would include identifying and  evaluating existing technologies and associated suppliers needed to meet SOJ  requirements; reducing the risk or developing a plan for managing the risk  associated with those technologies in SDD; assisting the Air Force in planning  for SDD (including developing spiral development strategies, if applicable)  and accomplishing B-52 SOJ Milestone B (approval for entry into the SDD  phase), and other related tasks.   The Lead System Integrator will be expected to develop and execute a best  value strategy to manage the risks associated with selecting, integrating, and  sustaining SOJ components of varying technological maturity into a cohesive,  scalable/expandable B-52 subsystem.  The Government will require insight into  the integrating contractor’s subcontract and vendor selection process and  decision methodology.  The integrating contractor will be expected to execute,  in partnership with the Air Force, a robust systems engineering process that  includes subcontractors and vendors and to perform all planning necessary to  be able to field and sustain the SOJ capability following its development.   The SOJ capability will complement and shall not degrade the aircraft’s strike  (both nuclear and non-nuclear) capabilities.  Full weapons carriage capability  shall be maintained.  Lastly, it is recognized that because of the B-52  experience and expertise that the Boeing Co. (the B-52 OEM) has built up over  the years, that its involvement will be necessary.  Thus, the Lead System  Integrator will be expected to interface with the Boeing Company or provide a  realistic plan describing how the bidder would accomplish the objectives of  the program without a Boeing interface.

ORIGINAL: The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate a sole source order against Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00019-04-G-0013 with The Boeing Company, 3801 S. Oliver Street, P.O. Box 7730, Wichita, KS 67277-7730 for sustaining engineering and technical support for the E-6B.  As the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Boeing is the original designer and manufacturer of the 707 airframe.  Boeing owns the historical design data, drawings, design principles/concepts, and structural strength relationships that are necessary to complete loads and stress design analysis and conduct structural rework trade studies to support the U.S. Navy E-6B aircraft.  The engineering and technical support are for both recurring and non-recurring support of the commercial/military derivative 700 series E-6B aircraft.  The planned period of performance is from 1 October 2005 through 30 September 2009 for a basic year and three option periods.  The recurring effort includes: research and analysis of data; engineering data; technical support services in the field for items such as engineering investigations and trouble shooting of maintenance issues.  The non-recurring effort includes: proposal preparation; reports; damage assessments; engineering support for aircrafts modifications and repairs; logistics support and other areas of support relating to 707 aircraft sustainment as necessary. This award is based on 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), whereby the supplies and services required are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Numbered notes 22 and 26 apply.

<DESC>Together the United Kingdom (UK) Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the US Department of the Army Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition , Logistics, and Technology) through the US Army Research Laboratory have been exploring mechanism s of improved research collaboration that would create a critical mass of government, private sector, and academia scientist, engineers, and facilities/equipment focused on solving the military technology challenges in network centric warfare for coalition  operations.  The International Technology Alliance (ITA) Program is a new bilateral cooperative technology concept planned by the Governments to achieve this goal.  In order to provide an opportunity for interested parties to network and learn more about the ITA program, two Opportunity Conferences were held, one on 01 April 2005 in Washington, DC and the other on 07 April 2005 in London, UK.   A revised Draft Program Bulletin (Parts I through VIII) has been posted to the ITA Program Website: http://www.usukita.com/.  A Final Program Bulletin is expected to be available by the end of May 2005.  No significant changes are anticipated between the r evised Draft and Final version of the Program Bulletin.   During both conferences, interested parties were provided an opportunity to ask the US and UK Government Managers, Scientists, and Business personnel questions specifically concerning the ITA Program.  A list of the public questions and answers is availabl e at:  http://www.usukita.com/QA/program_question_list.aspx.  Answers to each question can be obtained by clicking on the question itself.   The revised Draft Program Bulletin now requires potential Consortium Lead Industrial Partners to be prequalified by 01 July 2005.  Prequalification requests must be completed through the ITA web site at http://www.usukita.com/program_prequal.aspx.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC)/Specialized Contracts Office (PKR) invites prospective contractors to review the Request for Quotes FA8802-05-PKR1.  It is the intent of SMC/PKR to issue additional (refreshment) TASS Blanket Purchase Agreements to support the purchase of Technical/Management Advisory and Assistance Services by the issuance of delivery orders against GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Professional Engineering Services (PES) 871 Multiple Award Schedule contracts.  The NAICS code for this action is 541710, para 11c which defines a small business as 1,000 employees. SMC/PKR recommends that contractors form teaming relationships for this effort.  In order to obtain a TASS BPA, a contractor must be determined qualified in accordance with the evaluation criteria provided and must have a GSA FSS 871, PES FSS.   In order to be a qualified team member, a contractor must have a GSA Federal Supply Schedule Contract.  The TASS requirement is for the acquisition of services and support covering the following 6 core competencies and their associated sub elements:  1) Systems Engineering and Integration (Requirements Analysis, Modeling and Simulation, Systems Safety and Environmental Impact, and Test and Evaluation); 2) Management Services (Configuration and Data Management and Management Service); 3) Specialty Acquisition Support (Manufacturing and Producibility, Quality Assurance, Reliability and Maintainability (R&M), Electromagnetic Interference/Compatibility (EMI/EMC), and Facilities and Ground Support); 4) Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) (ILS Performance Planning, Packaging, Handling, Storage, and Transportation (PHS&T), and Continuous Acquisition and Life Cycle Support (CALS)); 5) Computer Resources and Software (Computer Resources and Software Engineering and Office Automation); and 6) Acquisition Security (Acquisition Security Support, Space System(s) Protection Program Support, Systems Security Engineering (SSE), and Acquisition Security Training, Orientations, and Conferences).  TASS Delivery Orders for Management Services, competency number 2 will be set-aside for small business participation only.  The ordering period under these BPAs is anticipated to be thru 30 Sep 06 with resulting delivery order period of performance up to 30 Sep 2008.  The Government reserves the right not to extend or to cancel BPAs in which the contractor fails to perform in accordance with the BPA or the Delivery Order, or in which the contractor has not received Delivery Orders.  To prevent conflicting roles, which may bias the contractor's judgment or objectivity, and to preclude the contractor from obtaining an unfair competitive advantage in concurrent or future acquisitions, the contractor will be required to accept an Organizational Conflict of Interest clause in the BPA. In order to be eligible for award of a delivery order, additional Organizational Conflict of Interest restrictions may be imposed by the Government.  Additionally, the BPA will contain an Organizational Conflict of Interest clause.  The contractor must possess, or be able to obtain, an Industrial Facility Clearance of Top Secret at the time of award.  Personnel supporting activities under these BPAs must be US citizens and have a minimum of a secret security clearance.  There may be delivery order competitions where the successful offeror must have personnel with Top Secret clearances.  The place of performance will occur at SMC, its Detachments, facility of other selected users or the contractor’s facility.

Contractors must use the SMC/AXC website, https://ax.losangeles.af.mil/axc to obtain a copy of the RFQ and its associated attachments.  Please mail your response to SMC/PKR, ATTN:  Missy Mitchell, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1467, El Segundo, CA, 90245-4659.  No more than one proposal will be accepted from a contractor during any six-month period.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis only.  This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the USCG.  The United States Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center is conducting market research to determine manufactures and suppliers of Aircraft VHF/UHF Direction Finder (Homing System) as described follows:   

The USCG is looking for products that will allow the HC-130H Hercules aircraft to auto-detect and home in on radio signals in the VHF/UHF frequency range of 30 MHz to 407 MHz. The direction finding (DF) system will be used to indicate relative bearing of a radio signal and provide that signal to multiple displays for aircraft homing. The unit should be capable of decoding and displaying a COSPAS-SARSAT data stream.

At a minimum, the direction finder should be capable of the following:

General Frequency Range 30 – 407 MHz (AM/FM); 
Search & Rescue (SAR) Frequencies 121.5 MHz, 243.0 MHz, 401.650 MHz, 406.025 MHz (ARGOS & COSPAS-SARSAT);
Modes of operation: Mode 1: manual mode (frequency selection), Mode 2: auto scan (of SAR frequencies)

Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete product details, brochures, and etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your product, configurations, auxiliary equipment, and options.  Also, state approximate lead-time for acquiring your product.  

Please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business?  (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified "hub zone" firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business?  (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned?   (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POC’s and contract numbers? (9) If possible, any POC’s for civilian users for general usage of product questions.  After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the CBD.     Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement.  All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis.  Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.

Responses to this sources sought notice shall be mailed to LCDR Ed Sheppard at Bldg 78, U.S. Coast Guard, Elizabeth City, North Carolina, 27909-5001 or e-mailed to ESheppard@arsc.uscg.mil.  Telephone responses will not be accepted.  Responses must be received no later than 01 July 2005 at 13:00 p.m. PST.  Firms responding to this announcement that fail to provide all of the required information cannot be used to help the Government make the appropriate acquisition decisions which is the intent of this sources sought notice. This notice is to help the USCG in determining potential sources only.  All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award.  All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation.

<SUBJECT>A -- BAA-SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE
<DESC>AJ61  - BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) for SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (S&T) INITIATVIES:,  
PROPOSAL DUE DATE: 12:00 NOON, on 30 JUNE 2005,   
BAA CLOSING DATE:  ONE YEAR FROM DATE OF PUBLICATION,  
POC: Edward J. More, Contracting Officer, Email: moree@socom.mil,     


PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2) a formal Request for Proposals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued.  This announcement will remain open for one year from the date of publication or until replaced by a successor BAA.  Proposals may be submitted any time during this period. however to be considered for the initial round of funding, proposals must be received no later than 30 June 2005.

The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) reserves the right to select and fund for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  USSOCOM provides no funding for reimbursement of proposal development costs.  Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.  It is the policy of USSOCOM to treat all proposals as sensitive competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purposes of evaluation.

USSOCOM is interested in receiving proposals for Science & Technology (S&T) Initiatives, which offer potential for advancement and improvement of USSOCOM’s intelligence and information operations capability including psychological operations.   USSOCOM’s is interested in funding research across a spectrum of science and engineering disciplines which have applicability to the production, distribution, and dissemination of information to mass markets including those over long distances.  Specifically, USSOCOM is interested in, but not limited to, the following technical areas:  Embedded Metadata – Enhanced Archive Storage/Retrieval, Enhanced Editing Technology; Blue Light Storage – Laser Technology For Enhanced Higher- Volume Storage Over Current Media; Standardized Formats – Eliminate File Conversion; Data Compression Capability Technology – Improved Bandwidth Usage; Virtual Studio Technology – 3D Graphics & Virtual Set Software Tools; Automated Data Archive Technology; Standardization Of  Deployable Production & Electronic News Gathering Capability Technology; Video & Audio Studio Modernization Technologies; Video & Audio Processing Enhancement Technologies, Enhanced/Improved Efficiency for Broadcast Transmitters, and Enhanced/Improved Efficiency for Broadcast Antennas.  The technology will be characterized, vetted in experiments and demonstrations, and in user exercises. Residual operational prototypes are then made available for future employment consideration.

The objective of this BAA is to provide USSOCOM a capability to produce, distribute and disseminate information. It is not the intent of this solicitation to establish new facilities, rather, to identify institutions that have demonstrated integration and development capabilities and have the necessary facilities to meet the objectives described.

Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selection. 

All are invited to submit a project proposal not exceeding 25 pages of text that describes the following:
1) The development and integration objective,
2) The development approach, 
3) Related work by the investigator or offeror, 
4) Anticipated contributions to USSOCOM programs, 
5) An estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for up to a three year effort, 
6) Proposed payment milestones and program schedule, and 
7) A curriculum vitae of the principal investigator(s) appended with any supporting information, such as reprints, that will assist in the evaluation of the pre-proposal submission.

Additionally, all offerors must identify any rights and restrictions that exist on their technical data, and all offerors are advised that restrictions on technology transfers outside of the U.S. will be imposed on all media created in accordance with this BAA.  All offerors must also state if a technology they plan to respond to in this BAA is currently transferred to other countries / corporations outside the U.S.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, proposals must be submitted electronically to USSOCOM SOAL-KBA 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, MacDill AFB, FL 33621 (Attn.: Mr. E. J. More, Contracting Officer) on or before 12:00 NOON, on 30 June 2005.  moree@socom.mil

It is desired that such technologies be: 1) deployable (ruggedized, robust in construction or packaging) from air-platforms, air-droppable, 2) low power requirements, 3) lightweight, 4) able to withstand a variety of environmental conditions and temperatures, and 5) trackable.


EVALUATION CRITERIA:

Award decisions will be based on a competitive selection of proposals resulting from a scientific review.  By submitting a proposal, offerors agree that one or more support contractors may be utilized as subject matter- expert technical consultants.  Evaluations will be conducted using the following evaluation criteria EVALUATION CRITERIA: 1) Practical application and operational technical merits of the proposed technology, 2) Demonstration of current emerging development model device, 3) Qualifications and experience of the principal investigator(s), and availability of facilities to support and conduct the integration, demonstrations, training, and deployment of systems and supporting architectures 4) Relevance of the proposed technology application to USSOCOM program priorities, 5) Realism of the proposed costs. Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal in accordance with FAR 6.102(d)(2) as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists. 


AWARD INFORMATION:

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by USSOCOM. Small businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for small business due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities. The government reserves the right to negotiate the type of award instrument determined appropriate under the circumstances.

The government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government reserves the right to select for award, all, some, or none of the parts of a proposal from proposal respondents. Proposals may be selected and/or award decisions made without discussions or negotiations.  The amount and period of performance of each selected proposal will vary depending on the research area and the technical approach to be pursued by the selected offeror. In general the basic time frame for period of performance is no more than 12 months. However in some cases a proposed project may require longer than 12 months to complete. For those proposed efforts that take longer than 12 months, a phased execution plan must be provided such that no phase takes longer than 12 months and all of the phases taken together take no longer than 36 months. Each phase must begin and end at logical, reasonable start and stop points in the total effort. For proposals requiring longer than 12 months for a period of performance only that effort that can be accomplished in less than 12 months will be initially funded. Follow-on effort (phases) will be treated as options.  The government reserves the right to fund some, all or none of these options.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Resource Adapter Interface Working Group
<DESC>The DoD's Automatic Test System (ATS) Framework Working Group has identified an ATS key element, called Resource Adapter Interface (RAI), which requires standardization. The purpose of the RAI is to allow test programmers to produce test programs that are platform, resource and hardware independent, and to provide for greater instrument interchangeability in ATE.  This means that test programs that run against an RAI supported test platform would be transportable to any alternate RAI supported test platform that has comparable ability.  RAI has been partially addressed by several industry consortiums in their attempts to instantiate workable solutions to the RAI goals, e.g. the Interchangeable Virtual Instruments (IVI) consortium and, before that, the SCC20 Resource Management System (RMS) IEEE - 1226.3 group.  

The DoD is soliciting industry members to define and publish a 100% solution for an industry accepted Resource Adapter Interface standard.  Once completed and accepted by the DoD’s ATS Framework Working Group, the RAI standard will be added to the DoD’s Information Technology Standards Repository (DISR), which will require its incorporation in all future DoD ATS acquisitions.  

Note that the Test and Diagnostics Consortium (TDC) will provide administrative support for this effort.  However, you do not need to be a TDC member in order to participate.

A kick-off meeting will be announced shortly.

<SUBJECT>--NETWORK AND INFORMATION SCIENCES INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY ALLIANCE
<DESC>Together the United Kingdom (UK) Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the US Department of the Army Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition , Logistics, and Technology) through the US Army Research Laboratory have been exploring mechanism s of improved research collaboration that would create a critical mass of government, private sector, and academia scientist, engineers, and facilities/equipment focused on solving the military technology challenges in network centric warfare for coalition  operations.  The International Technology Alliance (ITA) Program is a new bilateral cooperative technology concept planned by the Governments to achieve this goal.  In order to provide an opportunity for interested parties to network and learn more about the ITA program, two Opportunity Conferences were held, one on 01 April 2005 in Washington, DC and the other on 07 April 2005 in London, UK.   A revised Draft Program Bulletin (Parts I through VIII) has been posted to the ITA Program Website: http://www.usukita.com/.  A Final Program Bulletin is expected to be available by the end of May 2005.  No significant changes are anticipated between the r evised Draft and Final version of the Program Bulletin.   During both conferences, interested parties were provided an opportunity to ask the US and UK Government Managers, Scientists, and Business personnel questions specifically concerning the ITA Program.  A list of the public questions and answers is availabl e at:  http://www.usukita.com/QA/program_question_list.aspx.  Answers to each question can be obtained by clicking on the question itself.   The revised Draft Program Bulletin now requires potential Consortium Lead Industrial Partners to be prequalified by 01 July 2005.  Prequalification requests must be completed through the ITA web site at http://www.usukita.com/program_prequal.aspx.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-17.  This is a competitive 100% small business set aside.  It is the contractor’s responsibility to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions.  The clauses may be accessed in full text at these addresses: www.arnet.gov/far and www.dtic.mil/dfars.  The NAICS Code is 611699 and the size standard is $6M.  The FISC Detachment Philadelphia requests responses from qualified sources capable of providing the following Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs):  BASE PERIOD, LOT I (CLIN 0001):  CLIN 0001 is for Interview and Interrogation Course Instruction in accordance with the Statement of Work for a Not To Exceed Quantity of 480 students per year.

OPTION IV, Lot V (CLIN 0005): is for Interview and Interrogation Course Instruction in accordance with the Statement of Work for a Not To Exceed Quantity of 480 students per year. The following information pertains to the training course schedule for a 3-day (18-hour) course of instruction on Interview and Interrogation (I & I).  This instruction will be provided to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), Code 10B, Training Academy as part of the Special Agent Basic Training Program (SABTP).  The terminal objective for the training is:  Students will have the ability to conduct Interviews and Interrogations with successful results. The I&I training will be provided to 18-48 students per course.  The contractor shall be responsible to train NCIS personnel in the differences between interviews and interrogations; preparing for interviews and interrogations; room settings for performing interviews and interrogations; observing and evaluating behavioral symptoms; determining which symptoms are indicative of truth and which are indicative of deception; assessing verbal and non-verbal behaviors; evaluating paralinguistic behavior; implying the possible existence of incriminating evidence; conducting screening interviews designed to elicit behaviors to help identify potential suspects; confronting a suspect in a way designed to confirm his involvement in the criminal activity being investigated;  development of potential reasons why the accused may have committed the crime; dealing with objections from the suspect; presenting the suspect with a rationalized alternative reason for committing the crime and how to elicit details of the crime from a suspect.
This training will provide the theory, techniques, and practical exercises to newly hired Special Agents.    Upon completion of the SABTP, these employees are assigned the responsibility by the NCIS to conduct sensitive criminal investigations for violations of laws of the United States. Due to the requirements identified in the President’s Council on Integrity and Efficiency’s Quality Standards for Investigations of 1997, the NCIS has the responsibility to train new personnel to provide continuity to the Agency in the art of interviewing and interrogation.  For the past 2+ years, the NCIS has used contractors that instruct the John E. Reid Method of Interview & Interrogation (Reid) for training/instruction in interview and interrogation techniques.  The techniques and methodologies of Reid have proven to be very effective and have continuously provided the desired results.  Reid’s non-adversarial technique of establishing rapport and cooperation during an interview or interrogation is congruent with the mission/methodologies, policies and procedures of the NCIS.
The contractor must be able to operate in a geographical area that is beneficial to the NCIS. Currently that location is the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco (Brunswick), GA.  The contractor shall coordinate and arrange the travel and lodging for their employees.  The projected course dates for fiscal year 2006 are presently undetermined.  However, it is anticipated that approximately 1-10 courses will be required.  The result of this training enables the newly hired Special Agents to successfully conduct interviews and interrogations, initially under supervision, then on their own.  The ability to conduct quality interviews and interrogations is a necessity to any criminal investigator.  By receiving this type of training, newly hired Special Agents will be able to operate in concert with current NCIS personnel.  
This training has a direct impact on the ability of the NCIS to accomplish its mission of preventing terrorism and related hostile acts against DoN forces and installations; protecting DoN systems and information against compromise, and reducing criminal activity and mitigating its impact on Navy and Marine Corps operational readiness.  The value of this training cannot be overstated. 
Instructors must have experience in and the ability to provide training, allowing the students to perfect I & I techniques and methodologies.  Instructors will have experience/backgrounds from any military, public law enforcement, or private/corporate security agencies in conducting interviews and interrogations targeting all types of criminal suspects.  The lead instructor must have at least 10 years experience in the conduct of criminal I & I techniques, as well as a demonstrated ability (3 to 5 years of teaching experience) to provide effective instruction. Other instructors shall have 3 to 5 years of combined experience in both I & I techniques and teaching. A minimum of a Bachelors degree is required for all instructors.  Instructor resumes will be required after contract award.  In addition to the instructor qualifications, the contractor must provide copies of all training lesson plans to the NCIS Training Academy. 
Attached is information regarding the terminal and enabling objectives, course dates, services (course outline) that are expected:

If the contractor elects for the Coast Guard to correct the deficiency, the Coast Guard may assess the actual costs for correcting the deficiency.  The contractor agrees that the total actual cost may be deducted from the invoiced amount prior to payment.  An estimate of the cost for the Coast Guard to correct noted deficiencies will be provided at the time the contractor is notified of any noncompliance’s.

ACQUISITION REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR NEW MATERIAL ONLY.  The items being procured are end items.  Acquisition requirements are for new material only.  The items being procured are piece parts used in the repair of the ATF3 engine and associated components.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  Sources shall be certified by the FAA or the OEM.  ALL parts must be OEM certified or if the awardee is other than the OEM, the awardee must be capable of providing OEM manufactured parts with traceability.

<DESC>The Wesley Brown Field House at the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland is a design build project for a world-class field house approximately 13,000 square meters (140,000 square feet) in area. The field house shall be a new, multi-purpose facility for athletic competition including an indoor track and field; sports medicine clinic; varsity offices; trophy/recruiting hall; varsity locker rooms; varsity and physical education meeting spaces; storage spaces; spectator and multi-media spaces and systems; and other support spaces.

The facility is expected to enable the Naval Academy to effectively compete with major collegiate athletic programs, and other U.S. military academies (U.S. Military Academy at West Point & the U.S. Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colorado).  Therefore, the Government is seeking a facility design that is architecturally and aesthetically unique and superior; functionally outstanding for athletes, spectators, and broadcasters; and conducive to effective showcasing and multi-media broadcasting of athletic events on a local and national level.

Since the Naval Academy is a National Trust Historic Landmark District, the design and construction must be sensitive to the history and traditions of the Naval Academy.  The design will undergo stringent local, State, and National historic preservation reviews as part of the design/build process. The facility must also comply with DOD anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP) criteria.

This is a design-build project that will be procured utilizing a two-phase process per FAR Part 36.  The estimated cost of construction is $45,482,000.00.  Offerors must respond to the Phase I factors ONLY by 2:00 p.m. EST on 01 June 2005.  Please mail an original and five copies to the above address or deliver to the mailroom on the 1st floor of Bldg. 212.  Electronic submissions will not be accepted.  Please note that a solicitation is NOT being issued at this time.  The solicitation will only be issued to the most highly qualified offerors after evaluation of Phase I submissions.  The government anticipates issuing the solicitation in July 2005. The technical factors identified below are equal in importance to each other.  PHASE I.

Past Performance information is one indicator of an offeror’s ability to perform this contract successfully.  This evaluation will include the performance history of both the construction entity and the design entity.  The relevancy and source of the information, context of data, and general trends in a contractor’s performance shall be taken into consideration.  The assessment of the offeror’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror and establishes a level of confidence or risk for successful performance under this contract.  Past Performance findings will influence the relative standing of the offeror.  Findings will be used to validate proposals against established criteria. By contacting references provided under Factors 1 and 2, the Government will evaluate the offerors past performance.  Offerors are authorized to provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective actions taken.  In investigating the contractor’s past performance, the Government is not limited to the references submitted but may rely on other sources as well. Evaluation of Past Performance will be a subjective assessment.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services as well as fair and reasonable pricing.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s record of conforming to specifications and standards of good workmanship, and will evaluate the offeror’s record on cost control/change orders and adherence to contract schedules.  Subcontractor management, safety management, and other quality control programs will also be reviewed.  The Government will examine the offeror’s record for reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to customer satisfaction, and in general, the offeror’s business-like concern for the interest of the customer. Offerors may be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance, and the offeror’s response will be taken into consideration.  A review of CCAS and ACAS may be performed.  Phase II  factors are hereby provided for informational purposes only.  The full text of these factors will be provided in the solicitation.  Please do NOT respond to Phase II factors at this time.

Of the total subcontracted effort, the targets are a minimum of 15.3% to SDB firms, 13.8% to WOSB firms, 3.1% to HUBZone Small Business firms, and 3% to SDVOSB firms.  Large business firms will be evaluated against these targets with more credit given to firms who exceed these targets.  Factor 6 – (Design Solution).  Provide schematic building design drawings, schematic building elevations, schematic building section, site plan (s), perspective/axonometric sketch, study model and additional site, floor plan (s). All drawings shall illustrate the incorporation of the Anti Terrorism Force Protection requirements. PRICE.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The provisions and clauses in effect are herby incorporated through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-03.  This solicitation is advertised as a competitive requirement set aside for Small Businesses.   

The purpose of this solicitation is to extend the functionality of the NOAA Fisheries existing web-based application for managing Authorization and Permits for Protected Species (APPS) http://apps.nmfs.noaa.gov.  Members of the public can submit, track, and query applications online.  Permit specialists at NOAA Fisheries and the state fisheries agencies of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho manage authorizations and permits using the system.  The application has been built to handle permits and authorization required under the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act.  Web and database development must use Cold Fusion MX/MX2004 and SQL Server 2000.  The database must also be accessible using a Microsoft Access interface.  The scope of this contract covers Version 4, of the application, which encompasses the below enhancements.

Enhancement Process Streamlining shall allow permit holders to submit multiple end-of-year reports on approved projects that span multiple years; allowing the entry and tracking of public comments on applications; and automatic email generation for key stages in the application process.

Improved User Interact:  Develop user help feature into a contract sensitive, database-driven user help system, allowing printing of 1—individual help pop-up items, and 2—and organized compilation of all help items.   Develop the functionality to create merge documents based on document templates and system data, for printing or off-lien editing.  Enhance ad-hoc reporting feature to include additional search fields, ability to select specific fields to show in the report, and to save report settings.  Develop a default report that generates a list of records, which allows one to see the entire record.  Develop functionality for users to download search results into spreadsheet format.

The system scope must be expanded to accommodate the major amendments to permits, which require a 30-day public comment period and the same application process as a permit.  Minor amendment to permits – processing miner change requests that are simpler then major amendments.  Additional Permit Types:  1—incidental Harassment Authorizations (IHA) and 2—Species Parts, including making requests to the Stranding Network.

Linkages shall be extended to NOAA Fisheries PCTS system.  During and after development, system maintenance is required for web page edits, error fixes, database indexing and tuning, additional fields, and enhanced security.  System documentation is required to deliver releasable code of the entire APPS application to NOAA Fisheries APPS team.  Deliver complete data dictionary and database relationship diagrams of the entire APPS application to NOAA Fisheries APPS team.  Conduct a knowledge transfer meeting with the NOAA Fisheries team.

<DESC>PNNL will need a web-based software tool to facilitate managers to take systematic and proactive measures to (i) document existing internal controls; (ii) assess the adequacy of internal controls in programs and operations; (iii) separately assess and document internal control over financial reporting consistent with the requirements of OMB Circular A-123, Management’s Responsibility for Internal Control; (iv) assist in identifying needed improvements; (v) managing corresponding corrective action; and (vi) report periodically on the status of internal controls. 

The software needs to support the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s Enterprise Risk Management Integrated Framework (COSO-ERM) for internal controls and the audit requirements similar to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for Internal Controls.  Accordingly, the software should ideally allow the organization’s objectives, risks to those objectives and risk response to be captured.

Key benefits to be derived from this software include ease in documenting Internal Controls and the Control Environment, effective management of the Internal Control assessment process including identification Internal Control deficiencies, corrective actions and reporting.  By implementing the use of this tool, a reduction in annual cost of assessing and reporting on Internal Control required by OMB Circular A-123 should be achieved.  
	
In addition, the software will be expected to provide internal control documentation required by other audit agencies such as DCAA, Department of Energy Inspector General as well as others.

1		Scope of Work

The Contractor shall perform the following tasks:

(1) Develop detailed selection procedures for the selection committee based on the criteria specified in the Request for Proposals for the Rehabilitation of the Kairakkum and Varzob Cascade Hydropower Projects Feasibility Study Project and the host country’s procedures for competitive selection; (2) travel to Dushanbe, Tajikistan; (3) participate in the study selection process as an observer; and (4) prepare a final report to USTDA on the selection process.

It is the responsibility of the Contractor to verify with the COTR that the report is considered acceptable and ready for the production of the appropriate number of copies.  All reports must be paginated.  All reports must be submitted on a 3.5 inch disk in Microsoft Word.

In connection with travel, USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassy in Dushanbe, Tajikistan of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure.  The Contractor should contact the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure to brief and debrief them on the visit.   USTDA will request that the Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet. Logistics for handling the visit, including hotel accommodations, transportation and translation services are also the responsibility of the Contractor.

2  		Delivery & Performance Requirements

2.1		Kick-Off Meeting with the USTDA Program Office

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) (see G.2) to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  

2.2		Pre-Visit Report

Prior to departure to the host country, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report of 3-5 pages containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit, and the proposed evaluation criteria for the selection committee (proposed evaluation criteria must be consistent with the award criteria in the Request for Proposals issued for the Feasibility Study, but should be more detailed).

5. 		Project Descriptions and Profile

The Ministry of Energy has requested USTDA’s assistance with rehabilitation of the Kairakkum and Varzob Cascade Hydropower plants.  USTDA has provided a grant for funding of a Feasibility Study on the rehabilitation of these two hydropower plants, which will be competitively bid to U.S. companies through the www.fedbizopps.gov website. While the project is expected to attract many interested U.S. firms, the Ministry of Energy is relatively inexperienced with administering a competitive selection and has requested technical assistance in undertaking this process.   U.S. firms will submit proposals for the Rehabilitation of the Kairakkum and Varzob Cascade Hydropower Plants Project Feasibility Study in Tajikistan.  

This RFP concerns assisting the Ministry in choosing a contractor for the Rehabilitation of the Kairakkum and Varzob Cascade Hydropower Plants Project Feasibility Study. 

Tajikistan has abundant hydroelectric potential, one of the lowest cost power sources available.  Approximately 90% of the 4.4 gigawatts of installed capacity for electric power generation in Tajikistan comes from hydropower plants. The Tajikistan energy sector is controlled by the Ministry of Energy, which controls the State-owned Barqi Tojik company.   Barqi Tojik has a monopoly on production, transmission, and distribution of electricity in Tajikistan.  Tajikistan is a net importer of electricity.  Rehabilitation of existing hydropower projects are key to becoming self-sufficient in energy and reducing the relatively high cost of imported electricity.

The Ministry of Energy has requested feasibility study funding assistance for rehabilitation of two hydropower projects owned by Barqi Tojik.  The Kairakkum 126 MW hydropower project was commissioned in 1957 and is located in Northern Tajikistan on the Syrdarya river.  This project is the primary source of electrical production in Northern Tajikistan and is an important reservoir for irrigation.  All power units in the plant are considered to be at the end of their useful life, and a complete rehabilitation is required.  Rehabilitation would serve to make the units more efficient and to increase their reliability.  Rehabilitation is considered of the highest priority for the Ministry because of the dilapidated condition of the equipment and the lack of other domestic sources of electricity for Northern Tajikistan.  By replacing the existing Russian-built turbines with higher efficiency turbines with a greater output, total annual electricity production at the plant is expected to increase from 629 Gigawatt hours (GWh) to 888 GWh.  The total estimated cost of the rehabilitation of Kairakkum is estimated at $33.7 million.

The Varzob Hydroelectric Cascade is a series of three hydroelectric plants on one stretch of the Varzob River in central Tajikistan.  The project is an important source of power for Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, as it is located close to Dushanbe.  One of the hydropower plants has been mothballed due to the old technology and poor condition of the equipment at the plant.  The remaining two hydropower plants require new turbines, transformers and other equipment.  The rehabilitation is needed to keep the two plants working although no increase in generation is expected.  The total estimated cost of the rehabilitation of the Varzob Cascade is $10.5 million. 	

The Kairakkum project has an estimated return on investment of 150%.  Although the return on investment for the Varzob Cascade project is considerably lower, the importance of the project to powering the capital and the chance of a shutdown, mean that this project is of top importance to the Ministry.
