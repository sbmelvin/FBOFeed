This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of a Cisco switch.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The Cisco Catalyst 3560E switch is an enterprise-class, stackable, multi-layer switch that provides high availability, security and quality of service.  It offers Layer 3 granular quality of service features to classify and prioritize network traffic, and to avoid network congestion, can classify, reclassify, police, and mark the incoming packets before the packet is placed in the shared buffer.  Packet classification allows the network elements to discriminate between various traffic flows and enforce policies based on Layer 2 and Layer 3 quality of service fields.  The 3560E switch is capable of performing rate limiting with Cisco Committed Information Rate (CIR) functionality and offers enhanced data security through a wide range of security features that protect network management and administrative traffic.  The Catalyst 3560E switch meets the following requirements:
	The switch must provide Layer 3 routing services.	The switch must have HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) functionality.	The switch must perform at wire speed.	The switch must be able to be configured in active standby mode with high availability.	The switch must provide a committed access rate, limiting transmission rates based on flexible criteria.	The switch must have quality of service functionality. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.<BR><BR>

Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items.

D) Full NetApp  warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.<BR><BR>The purchase of NetApp filer warranty support and hard drive disk retention for systems currently deployed at PPT sites. The warranty support must be bought directly from NetApp as no other manufacturer or vendors provide NetApp branded warranty coverage for equipment.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. RAther, the services identified by brand nameherein have been determined to be the oly items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's networking system.  Due to CA's investment and overall satisfaction with the Network Appliance Filer equipment and the service that Network Appliance provides, ti would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt t identify, acquire, and install new hardware and new services at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use. CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the Network Appliance PPT. Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Government's best overall interests to procure and use this particular product. According to Network Appliance, the only provider of Network Appliance SupportEdge Premium 7x24 4 hour onsite support is Network Appliance. The services are currently not offered by any other provider.<BR><BR>

HP equipment for the hardware replacement of the core OpenNet Active Directory (AD) and AD support servers. The Active Directory is an integral part of the DoS IT Infrastructure and coupled with growing and changing operating environment, our hardware must be kept up to date. In addition this site is vital for the daily operations of the SMART and Exchange infrastructure. This continuity of hardware allows ENM to provide quicker support and response time to resolving issues on these servers. The current H/W has been in place for over 3 years and is nearing the end of its lifecycle. Additionally, the HP monitoring / Management software allows you to remotely update hardware driver and firmware on HP servers for greater security. You cannot update drivers and firmware on no-HP servers using the HP Monitoring / Management software -these servers are core equipment for command and control systems and need to be the same environment to perform forensics and advance troubleshooting of hardware related issues -Maintaining a single brand also allows for the possibility of hardware interchange in system emergencies reducing downtime. Frequently in the field server hardware is swapped to continue operations until a replacement part is installed. HP server hardware is not interoperable with no-HP hardware. The 41 USC 253(c)(I). and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications art cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to he the most cost effective means to meet the ENM support requirement and have been approved by the ENM CCH.<BR><BR>

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NAICS: 541620.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, intends to award a sole source modification to EPA Contract EP-W-04-047 in the amount of $96,241.00 to Eastern Research Group, Inc. to support on-going workon several work assignments through the end of the period of performance on November 30, 2009.  With the proposed $96,241.00 increase, the total contract ceiling shall be increased from $1,969,367.00 to $2,065,608.00 in Option Period 2.
Eastern Research Group, Inc. is the only organization available to do this work, as the work assignments that need continuing work were solely issued to ERG at the beginning of Option Period 2. The work assignments are completion efforts, and a break in services would prove detrimental to the Government.  
The proposed increase in ceiling will cover the estimated costs of ERG to complete the remaining work assignments through the end of the period of performance.  No funding will be provided for any fixed fee on the remaining efforts. 
No solicitation or Request for Quote (RFQ) is available for this procurement.  Nevertheless, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the EPA requirements described herein may submit a response, which if received by September 30, 2009 at 3:00pm EDT will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing.  A determination not to compete the described modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Federal Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY: The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design and Construction Excellence in Public Buildings, GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project.
<p>Project Summary: GSA announces an opportunity for Design and Construction Excellence in public architecture, engineering and construction through a Design-Build contract. The project shall be performed in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements for a New Tier III Data Center (Data Center) at the Denver Federal Center (DFC), Lakewood, Colorado. The Data Center is classified as a Tier III facility as defined by the Uptime Institute Tier Level Classification System. The work will be performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). The Data Center will be two stories high with a mechanical basement and will be built in phases using the Performance Optimized Datacenter (POD) concept. Phase One is the current building project, including core and shell and infrastructure to support the first POD Phase. When complete, the project will contain its own perimeter security system and parking for 2 cars on-site and 20 existing off-site, adjacent to the site. The completed two-story building with mechanical basement will encompass approximately 140,000 Gross Square Feet. As required by law, the facility will meet federal energy goals and all federal accessibility requirements and standards. The project goal will meet LEED-Silver rating requirements. The GSA is the lead agency for the delivery of this facility</p>
<p>As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA's P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). All GSA projects must achieve a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating with specific credits required.</p>
<p>The New Data Center will be located in a prominent position on the DFC at the corner of First Street and North Center Avenue, Lakewood, Colorado.</p>
<p>Prospective Offerors' experience must include, but is not limited to, work performed on data centers or projects of similar complexity.</p>
<p>The estimated cost for the design-build delivery of the Data Center and related infrastructure upgrades is between $65,000,000 and $80,000,000.</p>
<p>The design-build scope of work includes architectural, engineering, construction, security, commissioning and other related services necessary to construct the new Data Center. Related services include but are not limited to, site planning and infrastructure, geotechnical evaluation and monitoring, permitting, testing and inspection during construction, commissioning and potential additional requirements.</p>
<p>Procurement Strategy: GSA intends to award a firm-fixed price Design-Build Contract for the Tier III Data Center at the DFC based upon 35% bridging documents and Program of Requirements which will be provided with the Request for Proposal during Phase Two of the acquisition process for this procurement pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. The contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The five most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)).</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. For this RFP, technical evaluation factors, when combined, will be significantly more important than price. The importance of price will increase if Offerors' non-pricing proposal factors are considered essentially equal in terms of quality or if price is so high or low as to significantly diminish the value of a proposal's technical superiority to the government. The award may be made without negotiation of proposals. Therefore, offerors will be requested to initially submit proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.</p>
<p>The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about September 23, 2009 on the internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.</p>
<p>Opportunities for other than Large Businesses: This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable. In this procurement, GSA intends to promote contractors' and subcontractors' use of registered Apprenticeship Programs.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. All reporting requirements from the Contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) is providing notice that a Request for Proposal (RFP), W9113M-09-R-0010, for the Advanced Development of Medical Radiation Countermeasure (MRC) will be issued on or about 13 October 2009 with an anticipated contract award on or about 31 March 2010.  This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside.<BR>Small business prime contractors are required to comply with FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting and 13 CFR 125.6 (known as the 50% rule).  Rules on affiliation and joint ventures are at FAR 19.101, 13 CFR 121.103, 13 CFR 124.513 and 13 CFR 125.6.  Under the 50% rule where the preponderance of support is for supplies (other than procurement from a nonmanufacturer of such supplies), the concern shall perform work for at least 50% of the cost of manufacturing the supplies, not including the cost of materials.  The small business prime contractor must meet this requirement (1) individually, or (2) together with other small business members of a formal joint venture, or (3) together with a small number of small business subcontractors forming an informal joint venture, in which those subcontractors meet the definition of ostensible subcontractor as set forth in 13 CFR 121.103(h)(4). Team members in such formal and informal joint ventures are exempt from affiliation rules under the conditions set forth in 13 CFR 121.103(h)(3).  There is no limit to the number of other team subcontractors or size status of subcontractors. <BR>In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, all interested contractors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  CCR registration can be accomplished at the following website:  http://www.ccr.gov. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology, with a size standard of 500 employees. The Government does not intend to use FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.  <BR>The MRC shall be a drug or biologic that can be expeditiously developed, and when used after exposure to doses of ionizing radiation sufficient to cause the gastrointestinal (GI) subsyndrome of acute radiation syndrome (ARS), will either prevent/reduce the extent of incipient radiation injury or promote repair of manifest radiation injury to allow preservation/restoration of the anatomic integrity and normal physiologic functioning of the GI tract resulting in increased survival, reduced incapacitation, and sustained operational effectiveness. MRCs carrying logistical burdens (e.g., special handling or storage conditions lower than -20 degrees Celsius) may be acceptable, but are much less desirable. The MRC should be delivered by minimally invasive means and in as few doses as possible.  <BR>Development and delivery of the MRC product shall require a Contractor to coordinate and manage the activities associated with advanced development of the product. The Contractor will be responsible for conducting the various activities associated with drug/biologic development in manners that are consistent with eventual approval or licensure by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Associated Technology Development activities will include, but are not limited to: manufacturing process development and related tasks, current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)-compliant small-scale manufacturing and testing of the radiation countermeasure product, Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)-compliant acute toxicology testing in animals, pilot animal efficacy studies, filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, and conducting a Phase I clinical trial in accordance with FDA regulations and guidelines. After successful completion of the Technology Development efforts and Government review, the Contractor shall conduct necessary follow-on advanced developmental activities leading to FDA approval of the developmental end item.  The Contractor will be required under the base contract to provide one (1) FDA approved MRC.  The Government anticipates FDA approval of the MRC within 3 to 6 years after contract award, but all proposed delivery schedules will be evaluated.  A CLIN for production quantities of the FDA approved MRC will also be included in the awarded contract as an option.  <BR>Proposals will be evaluated based on Factors, Subfactors, and Elements representing the Best Value to the Government.  Delivery schedules of the FDA approved MRC shall be proposed by the offerors and will be used as one of the evaluation criteria associated with a Best Value evaluation. The current FY10-15 program/budget funding for this project is $12.29M. Additional funding is envisioned in the subsequent DoD Budgets, starting with the FY12-17 Program Objectives Memorandum. All interested parties can view, download, and print a copy of the solicitation and any resulting amendments when released on or about 13 October 2009 at the JPEO-CBD website hyperlink http://www.jpeocbd.osd.mil/packs/Default2.aspx?pg=180.  Scroll down to the bottom of the webpage and select the RFP number W9113M-09-R-0010.  No paper copies of the RFP will be provided and no mailing list will be maintained because the acquisition will be posted on the above website.  Questions or correspondence should be directed by e-mail to Sandra.Oconnell@us.army.mil or Drake.Russell@us.army.mil, please reference RFP number W9113M-09-R-0010.<BR>

<DESC>THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE - THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The VISN 19 Rocky Mountain Network Contracting Center, 4100 E. Mississippi Ave, Glendale proposes to enter into a single or multiple award contract(s) to provide Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Services for VISN 19 medical facilities.  Services shall be for a base period with four one-year pre-priced options for renewal.  The solicitation package should be available for download on or about 17 August 2009.  The NAICS is 423450 and the small business size standard is 100 employees.  This is a cascading solicitation.  All offerors, regardless of business size, are eligible and encouraged to submit proposals for this solicitation.  However, recognizing VA's commitment to the service-disabled veteran-owned small business, veteran owned small businesses, HUBZone small business, and small business community; this solicitation will be cascaded to ensure that these small businesses are given every opportunity to participate under this procurement.  The order set-aside preference will be: (1) Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB); (2) Veteran Owned Small Businesses (VOSBs); (3) HUBZone Small Businesses; (4) Small Businesses (SB), and (5) Full and Open Competition (small and large businesses). Each proposal will be evaluated exclusively against proposal in the same socioeconomic category.  For example, a SDVOSB proposal will be evaluated exclusively against other SDVOSB proposals.  A SDVOSB will not be evaluated against VOSB proposals.  Expanding this example, a SDVOSB or VOSB will not be competed against HUBZone proposals.  Caution to contractors - Submission of a proposal by other than SDVOSB concerns does not guarantee consideration or review by the VA under this evaluation process.  The evaluation process will proceed one round at a time, starting with the evaluation of SDVOSBs continuing through VOSBs, HUBZone proposals, small business proposals and concluding with full an open competition (to evaluate all remaining proposals).  If at the end of any given round, all solicitation requirements have been fulfilled by technically acceptable, responsible contractors, the evaluation process will end.  For example - If during the first round of evaluations, every solicitation requirement is fulfilled by SDVOSBs, the evaluation process will end and no other proposals will be considered. If there is need for a second round of evaluation and all solicitation requirements are then fulfilled by SDVOSBs and VOSBs, the evaluation process will end and proposals submitted by HUBZone, other small businesses or large businesses will not be considered.

<DESC>Headquarters, Air Mobility Command (AMC) Future Concepts will host an "Unmanned Cargo Aircraft Day," 17 November 2009, at Scott AFB, Illinois. Interested contractors, who have experience, knowledge, and/or concepts concerning the development and use (concept of operations) of an unmanned cargo aircraft are invited to present their concepts/ideas to government representatives from AMC, Air Staff, USTRANSCOM, USJFCOM, AFRL, and U.S. Army. Information gained from "Unmanned Cargo Aircraft Day" will be the basis for HQ AMC submission of 2011 advanced technology demonstration funding.
<p>HQ AMC is interested in exploring capability concepts for air delivery of cargo directly to the "point-of-need" using an unmanned aircraft. Conceptual attributes would include the capability to deliver critical supplies (ammunition, water, food, etc) in support of distributed operations, possibly during direct engagement.</p>
<p>Conceptually, the unmanned air vehicle should autonomously deliver 500-3000 lbs of cargo to a strategic combat radius of 500 nautical miles, at airspeeds of 250 knots (or equivalent Mach number) or greater, with a VTOL/STOL capability of 300 feet. Other attributes could include an air launched glide capability, powered capability, ship-based/recoverable capable, unprepared surface landing capable, skid landing, floatation capable, reusable, and inexpensive.</p>
<p>Interested contractors should submit a short abstract (no more than 1 page) describing their company's idea/concept, so that HQ AMC can determine appropriate concept applicability. Abstracts should be in Microsoft Word and emailed to Mr. Bob Nagel, HQ AMC/A8XC; email: bob.nagel@scott.af.mil no later than (NLT) 16 October 2009. Final presentations should be in Microsoft PowerPoint. Each contractor will be allotted one hour for presentation, questions and answers, discussion, and comments.</p>
<p>Due to the limited time slots available, HQ AMC Future Concepts will determine the most applicable presentations. Announcement of the final presentation schedule/agenda will be provided NLT 3 November 2009. Final presentations for those selected must be provided to Mr. Nagel NLT 11:59 pm CST on 10 November 2009.</p>
<p>For questions or additional information call Mr. Bob Nagel, (618) 229-4059.<br /><br />Note: This is not a solicitation for competitive bid, nor will it obligate the government to any contractual action. The information requested herein will be used within the Air Force/DOD to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency. Attendance is strictly voluntary and at contractor's expense. The government will not reimburse any costs related to contractor attendance.</p>

Below is the description of services required: 

SCOPE

The NRC Office of Information Services (OIS) has a requirement for an IT solution for information systems support and modernization.  The majority of the NRCs electronic documents and records reside in a system called ADAMS.  ADAMS is a mature system based on outdated technology and nearing the end of vendor support.  In addition, there are critical components in ADAMS that do not function properly and the ability to successfully recover from future failures is uncertain.  Many of the ADAMS components are on limited support by the vendor while other ADAMS components are rapidly approaching end of life. ADAMS system is based on IBMs FileNet Panagon Content Services 5.4 operating system..  The system is no long viable because it can no longer accommodate the NRCs need to manage an ever growing and large volume of unstructured and structured information for the foreseeable future.  Therefore, the agency will be upgrading the ADAMS operating system from IBM FileNet Content Services to IBM FileNet P8.  It is NRCs intent to procure professional Information Technology (IT) Services for the Enterprise Content Management (ECM) Program from a certified and authorized IBM FileNet P8 Contractor for the purpose of providing a full range of IT services, technical expertise, and project management expertise to:  1) migrate 17 applications from the Content Services OS that rely on ADAMS (see section C.6, Integrated Applications and Interfaces Dependent on ADAMS) and modernize them to operate under the P8 operating system (OS);  2) automate processes such as E-mail capture, records management, and document profiling; 3) provide operations and maintenance support for the Content Services OS (while it remains operational during the migration effort) and the P8 OS; 4) maintain and synchronize ADAMS Main libraries for both ADAMS OS- Content Services and P8 (see section C.5,  ADAMS Libraries and Access Mechanisms); and 5) migrate remaining users and content from the Content Services OS to the P8 OS.
 
REQUIRMENTS

1.   Information Technology (IT) Project Management

The Contractor shall provide a full range of business and IT project management and consulting services that assist in ensuring that the IBM FileNet P8 system meets NRC standards and is performing to its defined configuration, cost, schedule, and performance specifications/capabilities

These services encompass all areas of IT program and project management oversight including, but not limited to, issues management, enterprise architecture, information security, training, communications, organizational change, performance management, quality management, and risk management. 

2.   Re-Engineering, Migration, Integration, and Implementation Services
The Contractor shall provide re-engineering, migration, integration, and implementation services for any of ADAMS 17 integrated applications, interfaces, and business processes that need to be migrated to the P8 platform.  List of applications, interfaces, and business process.

Furthermore, DNS can be subverted by attackers to remotely control compromised hosts and exfiltrate extract data. To address these issues, PEO-MA has developed a plan to improve monitoring and management of the DoD DNS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This plan includes isolating the inner workings of the DoD DNS from the Internet by deploying proxy servers and enterprise recursive servers; enabling the authentication of transactions between DNS servers by deploying DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC); increasing the robustness of the "G Root" by implementing Anycast; and enhancing policy conformance through improved enforcement, doctrine, and education. Additionally, PEO-MA will continue to support the development of the Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND). BIND is developed and maintained by the Internet Software Consortium (ISC) and is the most common software used for DNS both on the Internet at large and within the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN<a name="OLE_LINK6"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">).</span></a></span></p>

The purpose of this market research is to solicit industry comments and/or suggestions to Product Manager, Radars (PM, Radars) relative to the evolving acquisition strategy for production of the Enhanced AN/TPQ-36 (EQ-36), as described herein. PM, Radars is currently in the latter stages of the EQ-36 System Development and Demonstration (SDD) acquisition phase, a Technical Data Package (TDP) for the SDD EQ-36 system was not procured due to cost considerations. PM, Radars anticipates conducting a full and open competition for the production of the EQ-36 using a combination of Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) and Time and Materials (T&M) contract types, with the equipment obtained on a FFP basis and the services obtained on a T&M basis.   However the government is soliciting industry input for incentivizing performance on this contract.   The period of performance is still to be determined.  PM, Radars estimates a production rate not to exceed six (6) radars per month to include spare and repair parts for production quantities of 150 to 190 EQ-36 Radar Systems with Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) commencing in FY11 and full rate production no later than 3QFY13.  An industry day is planned for 1QFY10 along with the release of the draft RFP.  The final RFP is planned for release during 2QFY10 and proposals due 3QFY10.  Source selection is planned to be completed by 2QFY11.  A planned key factor of the source selection process includes a live ammunition system demonstration. The demonstration is planned to take place at Yuma Proving Grounds (YPG) during 4QFY10 and would require offerors to provide a production representative prototype or better to be evaluated against a published test plan, shot matrix, and the performance requirements.  The shot matrix and test plan will be available at Industry Day.  U.S. Government validated data may be accepted in lieu of participation in the live ammunition system demonstration. Results will be used to evaluate the risk of achieving the required performance in the previously mentioned performance requirements document. To participate in the live ammunition system demonstration, offerors will need to provide all the necessary documentation to obtain frequency assignment for their respective systems in a timely manner if their proposed solution does not have a National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) approved frequency allocation.

Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made because Johnson Controls, Inc. is currently the only known company to provide the repairs needed to the York Millenium Model 18 ton chiller. The procurement must be completed in a timely manner in order to meet mission requirements. Questions should be directed to 1Lt Leonardo Cruz in writing via email to: leonardo.cruz@offutt.af.mil or via facsimile at (402) 294-7280.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT - Sole Source
<p>The 61st Contracting Squadron, Los Angeles AFB, CA is considering contracting for services on a sole source basis with Adam Finchamp Research. The requirement is for the Incorporation of a user friendly front end interface for the HK Cheng - CJ Lee Ocean Sonic Boom Codes.</p>
<p>The current Fortran versions of the OSB codes are run from cryptic command shell interface requiring detailed knowledge of both the program structure and input/out data formats. This requires an unrealistically high level of user knowledge to successfully run the simplest simulation. In order to promote better dissemination and general use of the codes it is desirable to rewrite the codes, integrating a more user friendly and intuitive set of input screens. The option to input parameters should in real world units should be provided and data output into Excel needs to be streamlined. The current version requires a user to understand and run a series of 5-10 different programs to attain a single result. By batching the codes together into a single or double pipe it will be possible to reduce this number to one or two and further, allow for direct calculation of entire sections or parameter space with single commands, once the physical inputs are decided.</p>
<p>Compile original Cheng and Lee Codes into a Visual Studio Workspace where codes can be built with a single command and linked with a C++GUI.</p>
<p>Batch script all input parameters for direct Matrix processing of an array of parameters.<br />Test and debug new codes, demonstrate effectiveness running large parameter arrays.</p>
<p>Document and demonstrate new codes, disseminate to relevant agencies.</p>
<p>The contract delivery date will be 90 days after contract award.</p>
<p>The purchase will be made under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized by FAR 13.501. The anticipated award date is 30 Sep 09. Please note that this is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the product/services listed above.</p>
<p>DEADLINE DATE for the submittals is 29 Sep 2009 at 6 pm Pacific Standard Time.</p>
<p>A determination by the government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>It is the Government's intent to negotiate on a sole-source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, for Operation, Maintenance, and Repair of the Fort Rucker Gunnery Range Complex, Fort Rucker, Alabama, with the incumbent contractor, Honeywell Technology Solutions, Incorporated for an interim three-month period 1 October through 30 September 2009, via contract modification to the existing contract DABK31-03-C-0001, in order to prevent a lapse in service. This extension has become necessary because of unanticipated delays in the pre-award process for the new competitive acquisition, which is currently issued competitively as W9124G-09-R-0002 and is extended indefinitely pending amendment and subsequent receipt of proposals. The contractor shall provide services to operate, maintain, and repair the Fort Rucker Gunnery Range Complex on a cost-plus-award-fee basis.

<DESC>This sole source notice is provided as required by FAR 5.201(b)(1)(ii). This contract action is a modification to an existing contract for additional services. This sole source determination has been prepared to document the facts and rationale to support the determination that only one source is available to provide the agency's requirement.  The supporting data has been prepared by the Bureau of Reclamation technical personnel.
1.  Description of the supplies or services: This sole source determination is for a modification to contract 09PG810169 with Glowball Solutions. The purpose of the contract is to develop major improvements to The Bureau of Reclamation Proposal and Performance Contract Management System (PropC) is a web-based application implemented by the Research and Development Office.
2.  Identify the proposed contractor and describe why they are the only source capable of providing the supply/service: Glowball Solutions has been the primary architect of improvements to the PropC system and is uniquely qualified to complete these improvements and provide technical support. Furthermore, failure to continue to acquire these services from Glowball Solutions will result in a substantial duplication of cost to the government as any other contractor will require substantial lead time to become familiar with the PropC system data, programming code, and architecture.
3.  Estimated cost: The Research and Development (R&D) Office is requesting an additional four months of funding be obligated to close out the existing contract in an orderly fashion.  During this time the R&D Office will work with the Acquisitions Office to issue another contract for the continued development and technical support of the PropC.  The additional time will allow for in progress work to continue uninterrupted. 
4.  Additional facts that support the sole source vendor: The original contract was issued as a labor hour contract and projected that Glowball Solutions would commit 35 hours per week to the development and technical support of PropC.  Actual effort to date has ranged from 40 to 60 hours per week.  The reasons for this increased effort are as follows: 
a. the R&D office accelerated the development and launch of a new version this year - portions of PropC were developed and tested immediately prior to usage 
b. additional requirements and revisions to the code were introduced as a result of an unplanned/unscheduled security review
c. significant downtime and server problems required additional technical support
d. increased meetings with the IT department and the R&D office to improve coordination.
Any responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal for these services by 5:00 pm MST, September 29, 2009, which shall be considered by the agency. Responses to this notice shall be submitted to Rob Brackett, Contract Specialist via email to rbrackett@usbr.gov

<SUBJECT>Oracle 9i Database Software Maintenance Renewal
<SOLNBR>HS0021-09-Q-0132
<RESPDATE>092809
<ARCHDATE>09292009
<CONTACT>John R Baumert, Contract Specialist, Phone (703) 325-8793, Email john.baumert@dss.mil
<DESC>The Defense Security Services (DSS) plans to issue a sole source award to Oracle. DSS requires the renewal of maintenance support for Oracle 9i Database which may only be procured from Oracle.  This maintenance renewal is critical to the existing ESS infrastructure.  Maintaining the use of our current version of Oracle Database 9i will serve to maintain the current capabilities of the ESS.

After extensive market research it has been evident that the renewal of maintenance support for Oracle 9i Database may only be purchased directly from Oracle.  DSS has in the attempt to obtain adequate competition requested quotes from several Oracle resellers available on General Services Administration (GSA).  After such attempts to obtain quotes from GSA schedule holders, the resellers conclude they are not authorized to sell extended maintenance support for Oracle 9i Database and thus could not submit quotes. 
DSS contacted Oracle directly and found that only Oracle may supply these software needs to DSS.

This is a unique requirement other than your standard annual maintenance.  This added service is not offered on GSA contract, NASA SEWP contract, or ESI. This is considered an open market quote.  Currently the 9i version is archaic and only had a five year life cycle plus three years of the Extended Support.  This is the final year for that added service.

The period of performance of this award will be from date of award through July 31, 2010 when the software has reached its end of life.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES.  Interested vendors may identify their interest and capabilities by providing a written notification no later than 4:00 PM (EST), Monday, September 28, 2009.  Responses will be considered, however, a determination to issue a sole source award is at the discretion of the Government.  Responses must be submitted via email to John R. Baumert, Contract Specialist at john.baumert@dss.mil.  Telephone inquires will not be accepted.

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupy approximately 4,539 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space in a building under lease at  11 West Courthouse Drive; Winona, Mississippi.  The Government intends on exercising a (5) year renewal option at this location. .  The delineated area is bounded as follows:  
	North by Hwy 23
	East by Hays Creek
	South by Hwy 35
	West by  Hwy 55
Other applicable requirements include:
-	Full-service lease (all utility, services, maintenance costs included in rent)
-	Parking  on-site paved parking spaces in a lot under Lessors control
The Government will consider alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement and market survey as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to exercise its renewal option to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.
EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

1. Building Name and Address, and location of space in the building.
2. Rentable Square feet offered and rate per rentable square foot (specifying services and utilities included)
3. ANSI/BOMA Usable Square Feet and the Common Area Factor.
4. Contact Information for Owner or Authorized Agent.

This is not a Solicitation for Offer, nor is this a request for proposal.  The Government will not pay for any costs incurred as a result of this advertisement.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service intends to award on a sole source basis a one month extension for software and hardware maintenance to Government Acquisitions, Inc. This requirement will be made on a sole source basis under authority of FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(C)(ii).

This EMC equipment has already been purchased and resides within the IRS computing centers.  This is simply to support the buyout of the lease equipment and provide continuous maintenance of existing software licenses and procurement of new ones in addition to needed increases in hardware to meet storage needs.  

Responsible sources who believe they can provide the required services may submit a written capability statement, via e-mail. Telephone inquiries will be considered non-responsive. No solicitation will be issued, therefore, requests for solicitations will be considered non-responsive. If no responses are received the award will be made to Government Acquisitions, Inc.

<p>The contractor shall conduct a Phase I Brownfields Site Assessment and Report, as well as Phase II on-site reconnaissance, Sampling Analysis and Monitoring Plan, Phase II Brownfields Site Investigation, Analysis of Field Investigation Samples, Disposal of Investigation-Derived Waste, and Draft and Final Phase II Site Investigation Reports.

Although the Agency's Office of Brownfields and Land Revitalization (OBLR) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OBLR contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk.

<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 811310. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.</p>
<p>Due to the unique bundle and equipment including several unique features, Xerox has been determined to be the only contractor able to fulfill the requirement of leasing and providing maintenance for the required equipment.</p>
<p>Detailed reasoning and unique capabilities are as follows:</p>
<p>Trade the DocuTech 6135 to Nuvera 288 Digital Perfecting System<br />o Unique capability: Nuvera 288 duplexes at 288 ppm and is the only product on the market that provides in-line tape binding and saddle stitching, which is critical since 50% of PFMPMS requests require adhesive tape bound.<br />o Unique capability: Nuvera 288 has patented technology that automatically purges unusable stock (tabs, inserts, carbonless, and/or pre-collated sets), recovers to point of error and, once the fault is cleared, continues production of the job. This happens without human intervention. This is critical, especially with short deadlines, like the Annual Budget. <br />o Unique capability: Nuvera 288 has a duty cycle of 3M impression per month.<br />o Unique capability: At 156 lpi, the Nuvera 288 has the best image quality in the marketplace today.<br />o Unique capability: Xerox is the only manufacturer in the industry that offers a Total Satisfaction Guarantee.</p>
<p>Trade the DocuTech 6115 and one DocuColor 6060 to Digital Production Press Xerox iGen4 110<br />o iGen4 110 prints at 110 ppm, regardless of substrate type including, but not limited to recycled paper, coated/uncoated cover, magnet stock, window decals/cling, linen and tabs. <br />o iGen4 is certified for PANTONE and PANTONE Geo matching.<br />o Unique capability: iGen4 can produce products on the smallest (7" x 7") and largest (14.33" x 22.5") substrate sizes. (At this time, EPA will only be using the 14.33" x 20.5" capability.)<br />o Unique capability: iGen4 is the only digital press that transfers an image onto the substrate in a single pass increasing front-to-back registration.<br />o Unique capability: The iGen4 comes standard with an in-line spectrophotometer measures both wavelength and intensity of light and automatically adjusts colors to ensure density and the spectral value of color. This makes it easier to emulate source color spaces, like Pantones, and to get more pleasing color. As a result, jobs will have consistent color on long-runs with little or no operator intervention.<br />o Unique capability: The iGen4 has auto density control (streak detection) within 1 mm and automatically corrects defects, without operator intervention.<br />o Unique capability: iGen4 also uses Xerox patented technology for automatic ordered stock recovery (Tabs, inserts, carbonless, pre-collated color sheets), which purges unusable stock automatically and maintains job integrity/order without human intervention.<br />o Unique capability: Xerox is the only vendor that can provide 600 x 4800 dpi print resolution, which is critical to the quality of documents.<br />o Unique capability: iGen 4 has an Auto Carrier Dispense system which is a new method of combining dry ink and carrier yields consistent color uniformity from the first print to the last and from job to job. Operators do not have to stop the machine and change developer, resulting in greater machine availability and productivity. <br />o Unique capability: iGen4 is the only digital press on the market with in-line punch and in-line full bleed saddle stitcher with square edge.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br /></span></strong><em>NO SOLICITAION WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THIS SYNOPSIS</em><br />The purpose of this Modification 48 is to obligate $612,216 in support of four work assignments (WA 3-100; WA 3-101; WA 3-103; and WA 3-104). The period of performance for work assignments 3-100; 3-101; and 3-103 is from April 13, 2009 through March 31, 2010. The period of performance of work assignment 3-104 is from July 30 2009 through March 31, 2010.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of WA 3-100 is to develop tools to assist the EPA's Office of Wastewater Management's (OWM) State Revolving Fund Branch to properly manage and provide oversight for funds provide to the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) under the ARRA. The tools to be developed under this work assignment include a checklist to be used by EPA Regional SRF staff to review and monitor ARRA funds provided to CWSRF borrowers to ensure that the funds are being used properly and effectively. The contractor shall also develop guidelines for State SRF programs to monitor and oversee how the federal ARRA funds are being used and to ensure that all federal and State requirements are being followed. The current value of WA 3-100 is $759,460 with additional funds to be required for Amendment 2 to the work assignment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of WA 3-101 is to support EPA in ensuring that States and EPA Regions understand data entry issues associated with ARRA reporting in the existing CWSRF Benefits Reporting (CBR) database. This will include supporting EPA's efforts to facilitate reporting transparency, and to develop, update, and expand a portfolio of reports on the environmental and economic impact of CWSRF loans made with ARRA funds. The current value of WA 3-101 is $103,129 with additional funds to be required for Amendment 3 to the work assignment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose WA 3-103 is to support the development of tools and training aligned with the unique aspects of the ARRA for Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) State programs and the borrower community of the DWSRF. This support will include: (a) participating in and providing support to a full day working session with the DWSRF program to support the development of a program oversight strategy for the unique needs of the ARRA funds. The contractor shall provide its expertise in program management, financial management, auditing and risks, and data management; (b) developing a means to transfer data from the DWSRF's Project Management System to the Office of Management &amp; Budget's (OMB) Recovery.gov website; and (c) supporting two (2) web seminars on the DWSRF and ARRA. This support for the webinars shall consist of getting a web seminar service, managing registration, and recording questions and answers during the web seminars.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose WA 3-104 is to support OWM by working with the EPA, Oklahoma Water Resource Board (OWRB) and other relevant parties to identify, develop, and refine metrics that capture the environmental, social, and economic benefits of ARRA funded projects. The contractor's efforts shall also focus on developing the appropriate reporting mediums for the metrics that will allow the State of Oklahoma to communicate ARRA related benefits to its stakeholders, and improve internal program management. Upon completion of project, Oklahoma's process for capturing and utilizing the benefits of ARRA funded projects will serve as a case study for other interested CWSRF programs. The current value of WA 3-104 is $76,497.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>Based on the positive response to a previous Request for Information, theOffice of Secretary of Defense (OSD) in collaboration with the US Army willconduct a Competition (with a cash prize for the winner) in order to fosterthe ability to clear training ranges of debris and unexploded ordnance usingrobotic technologies.  Experience to date with robotic range clearancesuggests a significant potential for time and cost savings as well asincreases in the safety for the personnel conducting this activity.  Theultimate aim is to return to productive use the millions of acres currentlyencumbered with spent training rounds and debris.  The Department of Defense(DoD) is looking for this Competition to result in viable systems that canbe procured and placed into service clearing ranges.
Given the expressed industry interest and capability, the Competition eventwill be preceded by a qualification requirement.  Competitors looking tocompete for the cash prize must first demonstrate a viable robotic systemcapable of executing tasks inherent in clearing ranges.  Assuming asufficient quantity of competitors qualify to participate in theCompetition, the DoD will award $2M in prize awards and pursue a procurementcontract to purchase robotic range clearance systems.  Both thequalification trials and the Competition will be held at Camp Guernsey, WY. A kick off meeting for the Competition will be held on 22 October, from0800-1600 hours, in the Monticello Ballroom, Crystal City Marriott, 1999Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA (near the Crystal City Metrostation).

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued. PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE. This combined synopsis/solicitation shall be posted on both FEDBIZOPPS and NECO (http://www.neco.navy.mil/). The RFQ number is N00244-09-T-0565. This solicitation documents and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-35 and DFARS Change Notice 20090729. It is the contractor's responsibility to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions.

The proposed contract action is for commercial supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all bids, proposals, or quotations received by the closing response date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 
The acquisition is for one (each) Retrofit of a 120K BTE Baldwin Hydraulic Testing Machine; and one (each) Retrofit of a 400K BTE Baldwin Hydraulic Testing Machine from Frank Bacon Machinery Sales, Inc., Warren, MI per the attached Specifications.  The equipment is for use at the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center, Pt. Hueneme, CA.   The Baldwin 120K and the Baldwin 400K need to be upgraded to be more user friendly for recording test information.

<p>See the following specifications that will provide the minimum requirements for the services for performance:<br /><br />The contractor shall provide all supervision, labor, materials to perform services related to conducting the E-rate Broadband Survey as indicated in the Statement of Work. <br /><br />OVERVIEW<br />The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 authorized the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to create the National Broadband Plan that shall seek to ensure all people of the United States have access to broadband capability and shall establish benchmarks for meeting that goal. Consistent with this effort, the Wireline Competition Bureau (WCB) seeks a contractor to conduct a survey as quickly as possible of all beneficiaries under the Schools and Libraries Universal Service Program, also known as E-rate, to determine the current state of broadband usage and access within schools and libraries in the United States in order to determine how to best address their educational and technological needs as part of the National Broadband Plan. <br /><br />PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />The period of performance of this task shall be from September 30, 2009 through January 29, 2010. <br /><br />BACKGROUND<br />The FCC is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and United States possessions. WCB is a bureau within the FCC which develops and recommends policy goals, objectives, programs and plans for the FCC on matters concerning wireline telecommunications.</p>
<p>The primary mission of the Telecommunications Access Policy Division within WCB is to advance the goals of universal service that all consumers in the nation have access to quality telecommunications and information services at affordable rates. The purpose of the universal service fund is to ensure that consumers in all regions of the Nation have access to quality telecommunications and information services at affordable rates. The universal service fund is one fund with four programs. Sspecifically, the E-rate program provides discounts to assist most schools and libraries in the United States to obtain affordable telecommunications services, Internet access and internal connections. The E-rate program generally supports connectivity - the conduit or pipeline for communications using telecommunications services and/or the Internet - as opposed to technology-related content. There are approximately 40,000 beneficiaries under the E-rate program. <br /><br />SPECIFIC TASKS<br />Work with WCB staff to determine the type of questions that are best suited for each survey area of interest: (1) Broadband Connectivity/Capacity; (2) Educational and Informational Applications; (3) Obstacles to Obtaining and Using Broadband Services; and (4) Future Projected Needs. <br />Draft survey questions in question and answer formats that provide enough information to produce the data needed to determine broadband use and access within schools and libraries across the United States.<br />Pretest the complete survey draft to ensure the respondents understand the questions and are responding accordingly. <br />Revise draft, if necessary, based on feedback provided by respondents who took the pretest draft survey. <br />Conduct the survey and data collection.<br />Conduct data analysis and prepare data reports as requested<br />Complete a draft survey with approximately 30-40 questions including each survey area of interest: (1) Broadband Connectivity/Capacity; (2) Educational and Informational Applications; (3) Obstacles to Obtaining and Using Broadband Services; and (4) Future Projected Needs by October 16, 2009 for review and feedback by WCB staff.<br />Pretest the complete draft survey from October 26, 2009 through November 6, 2009 to approximately 10 applicants. <br />Revise draft, if necessary, during the week of November 9, 2009 through November 13, 2009 based on feedback provided by respondents who took the pretest draft survey. <br />Conduct the survey from November 16, 2009 through December 30, 2009.<br />Review survey results with WCB and other Commission staff and conduct data analysis/reports from December 30, 2009 through January 15, 2009.<br />If any deliverables or material obtained during contract performance is classified as "Non Public - for Internal Use Only," the contractor will not release any item so classified to any person or entity outside WCB without the written permission of a WCB manager.</p>
<p>5. The Government will award a single contract resulting from this RFQ to the most responsive offeror, whose offer represents the best value in terms of technical capability and price.</p>
<p>6. Offerors must submit representations and certifications in accordance with the provision at FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representation and Certification - Commercial Item.

Liaise regularly with local participating banks who will hold and provide day-to-day accounts management over local currency accounts from which payments for infrastructure contracts will be made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ensure that banks understand USAID's role as financier, ensure timely submission of account statements, and understand issues that banks may face in program implementation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The incumbent will also work with the participating banks and construction contractors to encourage and provide safe access to banking services for wage laborers wishing to open accounts in the banks. 8. Ensure transparency in program execution by developing a program whereby all contracts awarded under the program in each District are publicized; including the winning contractor, the area where the contractor will be working, the rehabilitation activities that will be undertaken and the time frame for the contract to be completed. 9.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.

Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists offerors may be required to submit information other than cost or pricing data to support a determination of price reasonableness.</p>
<p>C. Specific Instructions:</p>

In addition, explain corrective actions taken in the past, if any, for substandard performance and any current performance problems such as cost overruns, extended performance periods, numerous warranty calls, etc.</p>
<p>(b) Past Performance Surveys: The government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. The government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance. Provide a list of no more than five (5), of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last three years. Relevant contracts include aircraft washing of this magnitude and effort. The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition.

<p>(d) Documents submitted in response to this solicitation must be fully responsive to and consistent with the following:</p>
<p>1. Requirements of the solicitation (Item Numbers) and Performance Work Statement (PWS), and government standards and regulations pertaining to the PWS.</p>
<p>2. Evaluation Factors for Award.</p>
<p>General Information</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned that Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Georgia has visitor control procedures requiring individuals not affiliated with the installation to obtain a visitor pass prior to entrance. SOME DELAY SHOULD BE ANTICIPATED WHEN HAND-CARRYING PROPOSALS. Late proposals will be processed in accordance with FAR 52.212-1(f) "Late submission, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) PAST PERFORMANCE<br />(2) PRICE</p>
<p>Past Performance is significantly more important than Price when being evaluated.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999) Addendum</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than price. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause 52.212-1, Instructions to offeror, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and past performance records. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. Initially offers shall be ranked according to price, including option prices. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) to confirm the extended amount for each. The offers will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness of the proposed evaluated price.</p>
<p>B. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information based on the references provided by the offeror and data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant past performance includes performance of efforts involving the performance of services described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating.</p>
<p>C. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this solicitation based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall past performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence as defined herein. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will/will not be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. When no performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned, the rating will be "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>D. Performance Confidence Assessment Rating. Past performance will be used as a measure of the Government's confidence in the offeror's ability to successfully perform based on previous and current contracts and support agreements. Past performance information may be obtained through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), questionnaires provided by the offeror (see part 2 of Addendum to</p>
<p>52.212.-1 - Instructions to Offerors), through Defense Contract Management Command Channels, through interviews with program managers and contracting officers , or other sources known to the Government. Data from previous source selections or contractor capability assessments will be used if the data is recent and relevant. A confidence assessment rating will be assigned to each offeror as follows:</p>
<p>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE - Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE - Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITED CONFIDENCE - Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NO CONFIDENCE - Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE - No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned</p>
<p>E. Performance Evaluation - Relevancy Ratings. To assist the Government's evaluation, each offeror's supporting past performance will be evaluated for relevancy as follows:</p>
<p>VERY RELEVANT - Past performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>RELEVANT - Past performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>SOMEWHAT RELEVANT - Past performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>NOT RELEVANT - Past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>F. Past Performance Evaluation - Recency:<br />Only past performance being performed within the last three (3) years of proposal due date shall be considered for recency.</p>

<p>Under Federal law, employees cannot be required to join a union or maintain membership in a union in order to retain their jobs.

However, employees who are not union members can object to the use of their payments for certain purposes and can only be required to pay their share of union costs relating to collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment.</p>
<p>If you do not want to pay that portion of dues or fees used to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you are entitled to an appropriate reduction in your payment. If you believe that you have been required to pay dues or fees used in part to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you may be entitled to a refund and to an appropriate reduction in future payments.</p>

HP equipment for the hardware replacement of the core OpenNet ActiveDirectory (AD) and AD support servers. The Active Directory is an integral part of the DoS ITInfrastructure and coupled with growing and changing operating environment, our hardware mustbe kept up to date. In addition this site is vital for the daily operations of the SMART and Exchangeinfrastructure. This continuity of hardware allows ENM to provide quicker support and responsetime to resolving issues on these servers. The current H/W has been in place for over 3 years and isnearing the end of its lifecycle.  Additionally, the HP monitoring / Management software allows you to remotely update hardware driver and firmware on HP servers for greater security.  You cannot update drivers and firmware on no-HP servers using the HP Monitoring / Management software -these servers are core equipment for command and control systems and need to be the same environment to perform forensics and advance troubleshooting of hardware related issues -Maintaining a single brand also allows for the possibility of hardware interchange in system emergencies reducing downtime.  Frequently in the field server hardware is swapped to continue operations until a replacement part is installed.  HP server hardware is not interoperable with no-HP hardware.  The 41 USC 253(c)(I). and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications art cited asthe basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have beendetermined to he the most cost effective means to meet the ENM support requirement and havebeen approved by the ENM CCH.<BR><BR>

HP equipment for the hardware replacement of the core OpenNet ActiveDirectory (AD) and AD support servers. The Active Directory is an integral part of the DoS ITInfrastructure and coupled with growing and changing operating environment, our hardware mustbe kept up to date. In addition this site is vital for the daily operations of the SMART and Exchangeinfrastructure. This continuity of hardware allows ENM to provide quicker support and responsetime to resolving issues on these servers. The current H/W has been in place for over 3 years and isnearing the end of its lifecycle.  Additionally, the HP monitoring / Management software allows you to remotely update hardware driver and firmware on HP servers for greater security.  You cannot update drivers and firmware on no-HP servers using the HP Monitoring / Management software -these servers are core equipment for command and control systems and need to be the same environment to perform forensics and advance troubleshooting of hardware related issues -Maintaining a single brand also allows for the possibility of hardware interchange in system emergencies reducing downtime.  Frequently in the field server hardware is swapped to continue operations until a replacement part is installed.  HP server hardware is not interoperable with no-HP hardware.  The 41 USC 253(c)(I). and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications art cited asthe basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have beendetermined to he the most cost effective means to meet the ENM support requirement and havebeen approved by the ENM CCH.<BR><BR>

The plant consists of four, 400kW, natural gas, synchronous engine generator sets for a 1,600 kW CHP system that can generate power for the Facility in parallel with the Con Edison electrical supply. It can also provide thermal energy in the form of low pressure steam to the building in parallel with the Con Edison steam supply. The CHP units produce 45 PSI steam through modularized waste heat recovery boilers. There are two (2) Heat Recovery Hot Water Generators located in the CHP area that recover condensate. Jacket water will also be used to heat domestic hot water when condensate is not available. There are eight (8) radiators/condensers for the jacket water and intercooler installed on the roof. Flues from each of the CHP units are combined into one large stack which will be installed in an existing boiler chimney.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Apple XSan Server is the best product that both meets the technical needs of the program, and complements existing equipment in use by the program. 3-After extensive research by ISM videographers that spanned several years the decision to use the Apple, Inc. XSanServer was reached for multiple reasons that make it the only product that can satisfy the programs multimedia requirements; 3a-ISM MultiMedia has an existing system of five McIntosh Final Cut Pro processing stations that can be interconnected.  Choosing a Mac-based  Final Cut Pro compatible solution will minimize the amount of re-training for the team and it will utilize the existing Macs directly into the Storage Area Network, which would avoid incurring costs of buying more processing stations compatible with a different system; 3b-The Final Cut Server Storage Area Network permits a common storage location for imagery and it supports a project approach to check-out and in, while permitting others (training developers) to research and view a huge inventory of imagery; 3c- The Apple XSanServer is scalable so additional terabyte drives can be added over time to keep up with content growth and still support meta tagging and full indexing of content. 4- The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 ( c) (2). The regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 5-Apples XSan Server solution is a recognized state of the art imagery storage system.  The existing number of Mac workstations currently in use at the DS Training Center will integrate smoothly into this Storage Area Network. Furthermore, if a solution through a PC-based provider were used it would require the program to overhaul its workstation computers to be compatible with a PC based server. This would incur further cost to the Government, and provide an inferior system the program is unfamiliar with, hindering their productivity. Procuring a compatible, technically superior, and cost effective server is the only solution to provide best value to the Programs mission. 8- Over the course of the research into other solutions for an ISM imagery management system other solutions were considered.  Similar capabilities were available but at significantly higher costs.<BR><BR>

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of a Cisco switch.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The Cisco Catalyst 3560E switch is an enterprise-class, stackable, multi-layer switch that provides high availability, security and quality of service.  It offers Layer 3 granular quality of service features to classify and prioritize network traffic, and to avoid network congestion, can classify, reclassify, police, and mark the incoming packets before the packet is placed in the shared buffer.  Packet classification allows the network elements to discriminate between various traffic flows and enforce policies based on Layer 2 and Layer 3 quality of service fields.  The 3560E switch is capable of performing rate limiting with Cisco Committed Information Rate (CIR) functionality and offers enhanced data security through a wide range of security features that protect network management and administrative traffic.  The Catalyst 3560E switch meets the following requirements:
	The switch must provide Layer 3 routing services.	The switch must have HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) functionality.	The switch must perform at wire speed.	The switch must be able to be configured in active standby mode with high availability.	The switch must provide a committed access rate, limiting transmission rates based on flexible criteria.	The switch must have quality of service functionality. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.<BR><BR>

The information technology should also use the Windows Installer Service for installation to the default program files directory and should be able to silently install and uninstall.(c) Applications designed for normal end users shall run in the standard user context without elevated system administration privileges.(d) The Department of State currently intends to use Vista in Protected Mode in the future when all devices at all worldwide locations have sufficient capacity to permit an upgrade from the XP operating system.<BR><BR>The Contractor and its employees shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters relating to their duties and functions. They shall not communicate to any person any information known to them by reason of their performance of services under this contract which has not been made public, except in the necessary performance of their duties or upon written authorization of the Contracting Officer.  All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government. Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer. These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>CA/CST/ES owns and has in use several IBM servers.  These IBM servers are used to support projects throughout the Washington Metropolitan Area. The warranties already have or are about to expire; however, they are still in use and are an essential part to CA/CST/ES.  By extending the warranty and reinstating the equipment, CA can ensure that IBM will provide hardware and software troubleshooting after business hours or over the weekend, followed by on-site service and parts when necessary. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.
Due to CAs investment and overall satisfaction with IBM servers and the service IBM provides, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install new hardware and new services at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use.  CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the IBM servers.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular product.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br />THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN AWARDED ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) TARGETED BROWNFIELDS ASSESSMENTS (TBA) CONTRACTS</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice to announce the intention to competitively award a Task Order from the Targeted Brownfields Assessments (TBA) Contracts Request For Offer # 33. The period of performance will be from September 14, 2009 though September 27, 2010.</p>
<p>The contractor shall conduct a Phase I Brownfields Site Assessment and Report, as well as Phase II on-site reconnaissance, Sampling Analysis and Monitoring Plan, Phase II Brownfields Site Investigation, Analysis of Field Investigation Samples, Disposal of Investigation-Derived Waste, and Draft and Final Phase II Site Investigation Reports. The overall objective of the Targeted Brownfields Assessment is to: 1) determinate more fully the types and general extent of soil and groundwater contamination on site; 2) determine, using published Pennsylvania State and federal risk-based regulatory standards, the risks posed by contamination; 3) develop potential alternatives for clean-up; and 4) estimate order of magnitude costs of implementing the clean-up alternatives that would help support decision making concerning future redevelopment of the Brownfield site. The site is located in Allentown, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Brownfields and Land Revitalization (OBLR) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OBLR contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OBLR contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<br />THIS REQUIREMENT IS TO BE AWARDED TO EXISTING EPA CONTRACTHOLDERS ONLY. <br />REQUESTS AND/OR INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ANSWERED. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CALL OR E-MAIL.</p>

DeVenCI is a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) activity whose dual goals are to speed DoD adoption of promising new commercial technologies and to encourage broader commercial support of the DoD supply chain. DeVenCI uses workshops, technical expositions, industry outreach, and a publically available web portal (http://devenci.dtic.mil/) to increase the visibility of DoD needs to commercial companies and technology area experts. It provides timely information to DoD users about emerging technical innovations and pilot opportunities. DeVenCI is a catalyst initiative that does not fund the development of new technologies or businesses. Instead, it focuses on knowledge brokering by encouraging and facilitating the sharing of information to speed adoption of emerging technology solutions to DoD user needs.
Companies interested in applying for participation in this workshop should contact DeVenCI via e-mail at devenci@osd.mil for an application. All applications must be received on or before October 22, 2009. Selected companies will be responsible for their travel and all other expenses associated with participation in this workshop which will be held in the January timeframe.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY: The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design and Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project.</p>
<p>Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design and Construction Excellence Programs seeks to commission our nation's most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give form and meaning to our democratic values.</p>
<p>In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA's P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). All GSA projects must achieve a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating with specific credits required.</p>
<p><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to construct a new Tier III Data Center at the Denver Federal Center in Lakewood, Colorado. The Data Center will be located in the Northeast corner of the DFC campus on the corner of {East} First Street and North Center Avenue. The Tier III Data Center is based on the Uptime Institute Tier Level Classification System which will contain redundancy for failure and maintenance and shall be built utilizing the Performance Optimized Datacenter (POD) concept.</p>
<p>The building will include 2 stories with a mechanical basement, for 110,000 gross square feet (GSF). The new Data Center will be located in a prominent position on the DFC at the corner of first Street and North Center Avenue, Lakewood, Colorado. The project will be built in phases. Phase 1 is the current building project, including core, shell and infrastructure to support the first POD Phase. When complete the project will contain its own perimeter security system and parking for 20 vehicles.</p>
<p>The project will include the performance of architectural, engineering, construction, security, commissioning and other related services necessary to construct the new Data Center. Related services include but are not limited to, site planning and infrastructure, geotechnical evaluation and monitoring, permitting, testing and inspection during construction, commissioning and potential additional requirements. The project will be based on 20% Bridging Documents and Program of Requirements, which will be provided with the Request for Proposal during Phase II of the acquisition process for this procurement pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The project shall be performed in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements for a new Tier III Data Center (Data Center) at the Denver Federal Center (DFC), Lakewood, Colorado. The Data Center is classified as a Tier III facility as defined by the Uptime Institute Tier Level Classification System. The work will be performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). The Data Center will be two stories high with a mechanical basement and will be built in phases using the Performance Optimized Datacenter (POD) concept. Phase 1 is the current building project, including core and shell and infrastructure to support the first POD Phase. When complete, the project will contain its own perimeter security system and parking for 2 cars on-site and 20 existing off-site, adjacent to the site. The completed two-story building with mechanical basement will encompass approximately 110,000 Gross Square Feet. As required by law, the facility will meet federal energy goals and all federal accessibility requirements and standards. The project goal will meet LEED-Silver rating requirements. The GSA is the lead agency for the delivery of this facility</p>
<p>The scope of professional services will require the minimum services as follows: architectural, engineering, construction, security, commissioning. This list is not all-inclusive.</p>
<p>GSA will contract separately for Construction Management as Agent (CMa) services. The CMa will be involved in the design process to provide construction expertise, estimating and cost information, and functionality and constructability reviews. There will be a formal partnering process throughout the design and construction phases to promote successful project development and execution through voluntary commitments to accomplish established agreed-upon project objectives by all involved parties.</p>
<p>The estimated cost for the design-build delivery of the new Data Center is between $65,000,000 and $80,000,000.</p>
<p>Opportunities for other than Large Businesses: This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses to the maximum extent practicable. In this procurement, GSA intends to promote contractors' and subcontractors' use of registered Apprenticeship Programs.</p>
<p>NOTICE TO OFFERORS<br />GSA intends to award a firm-fixed price Design-Build Contract based upon 20% bridging documents and Program of Requirements which will be provided with the Request for Proposal during Phase II of the acquisition process for this procurement pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. A maximum of up to five (5) firms will be short listed unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than five (5) is in the Government's best interest. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)).<br /><br />A best value concept will be applied for evaluation of offers and selection of the successful Offeror for this procurement. The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an Offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked. GSA will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being weighed more heavily than price. Therefore, the Offeror's proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms.</p>
<p>This procurement will be conducted as a Two-Phase Deisgn-build process. Phase One will evaluate the technical qualifications and experience of the design and construction teams formed by each potential offeror for this procurement. Phase Two will interview the key Design-Build team members, evaluate the proposed technical solution and Project Management Plan of each design and construction team.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions or negotiations.</p>
<p>GSA IS HEREBY REQUESTING PHASE ONE PROPOSALS. This Phase One Solicitation provides Offerors with instructions regarding the submission of their complete Proposals and the evaluation thereof. Utilizing the format prescribed within, Offerors are to provide the requested information and demonstrate their qualifications. Responses shall be as complete and accurate as possible and present data relative to the specific Project under consideration. Offerors shall make every effort to present information clearly and concisely in accordance with the formats described herein.</p>
<p>A. PHASE ONE - REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS (RFQ)</p>
<p>Mandatory Requirements: The following evaluation factors will be evaluated on a "go/no-go" basis, i.e.; offerors not meeting all of the following criteria will be eliminated from further consideration. The Contracting Officer will make the initial determination as to offer responsibility/responsiveness, and submit only those offers to the SSEB for full evaluation.</p>
<p>a. Qualifications Statement conforms to the requirements of the Request For Qualifcations (RFQ), including, but<br />not limited to:<br />&bull; Proof of CCR Registration<br />&bull; Proof of bonding capacity to $110,000,000.<br />b. Qualifications Statement must meet the minimum requirements of the RFQ</p>

<DESC><p><strong>ADDING;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase 1 Solicitation - Request for Qualifications (RFQ)<br /></strong>Closing Date for Receipt of Proposals is October 28, 2009 4:00PDT<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />RECOVERY: The General Services Administration (GSA), Region 10 announces an opportunity for Design and Construction Excellence in Public Buildings for the Redevelopment/Modernization of Federal Center South B12021,located in Seattle Washington. GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project</p>
<p>
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The project is a Redevelopment/modernization of an existing early 1940s warehouse (1202) located at Federal Center South campus. The building is a timber-framed single story warehouse with exterior concrete walls. The building is supported on timber piles with concrete followers. The followers are 14inch in diameter by 11 feet long and extend from the underside of the concrete slab to the top of the timber piles. Single piles are spaced 8 feet on center. The building is approximately 330 feet wide by 1100 feet long and is immediately to the west of the historic Albert Kahn-designed Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant (1201) completed in 1932, at 4735 East Marginal Way Seattle, WA. The proposed project site will encompass approximately 50% of the footprint of the existing building. The 1202 building has been determined not to be historic. This project will provide for the projected 15-year space requirements of the USACE and is the pivotal undertaking for a campus-like site redevelopment that can accommodate the 30-year expansion requirements for a number of other Federal Agencies. This project will help to revitalize the neighborhood and receive an architectural treatment that is responsive to its context and due to its adjacency to the 1201 building compatible with historic precedents.</p>
<p>The Design Build project shall include the performance of architectural/egineering services based on an approved concept selected during the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of the acquisition process. The design will be in accordance with GSA quality standards and will address the specific tenant requirements of the USACE. The warehouse redevelopment/modernization will include 150,000-200,000 gross square feet of new office space for the USACE and may include space for a child care facility and cafeteria food services. As required by the ARRA legislation, the facility will be designed to be a high performing green building (HPGB) and as such will meet the most current federal energy goals. The project goal is to meet LEED-NC, Gold rating requirements. All Federal accessibility requirements and standards will also be met as required by law.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes the redevelopment of the building through a strategy of structure and materials reuse to the greatest practicable extent, introduction of modern building systems and use of innovative technologies to meet HPGB strategies. The work will also include seismic upgrades and repair and/or replacement of the existing foundation, stabilization of liquefiable soils and any associated site development. The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, landscape architectural, engineering, interior design, HPGB consulting service, historic architecture and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, Building Information Modeling (BIM), metric and English construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, space planning, value engineering services, LEED-AP services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD). The project shall comply with GSA design standards for secure facilities, USACE force protection requirements and USACE tenant requirements. The design-builder should incorporate Low Impact Development (LID) strategies. The design-builder will be required to work with artist(s) in support of the Art-in-Architecture Program.</p>
<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The maximum Estimated Cost of Construction is between $50,000,000.00 and $70,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: 30 - 36 months (Design and Construction)</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A $50,000 - $75,000 stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using Best Value Source Selection pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. The contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range (short list) to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)).</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA R10 contemplates awarding a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) type contract provided all waivers, deviations, and approvals are authorized prior to issuance of the Phase 2 solicitation. Failure to obtain the necessary GMP type contract approvals will result in awarding a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Phase 2 RFP will identify which pricing methodology will be awarded, and will contain special provisions and clauses as necessary.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about 09/17/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.</p>
<p>CLOSING DATE: The estimated closing date for receipt of Phase I submittals is October 16, 2009.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. All reporting requirements from the Contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation for Bids, Request for Quotations (RFQ), or a Request for Proposals (RFP). Additionally, there is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services described in this RFI. Your response to this RFI will be treated only as information for the Government to consider. You will not be entitled to payment for any direct or indirect costs that you incur in responding to this RFI. This request does not constitute a request for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Government in refining its acquisition plan, Statement of Work/Statement of Objectives and Performance Specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.<BR><BR>The United States Army CECOM Contracting Center, Army Contracting Command, is seeking additional information to the RFI that was posted on 09 February 2009, on the Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP) under Solicitation number W15P7T-09-R-T005, titled  Counterfire Target Acquisition Radar System (CTA) Request for Information (RFI). The purpose of this market research is to solicit industry comments and/or suggestions to Product Manager, Radars (PM, Radars) relative to the evolving acquisition strategy for production of the Enhanced AN/TPQ-36 (EQ-36), as described herein. PM, Radars is currently in the latter stages of the EQ-36 System Development and Demonstration (SDD) acquisition phase, a Technical Data Package (TDP) for the SDD EQ-36 system was not procured due to cost considerations. PM, Radars anticipates conducting a full and open competition for the production of the EQ-36 using a combination of Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) and Time and Materials (T&M) contract types, with the equipment obtained on a FFP basis and the services obtained on a T&M basis.   However the government is soliciting industry input for incentivizing performance on this contract.   The period of performance is still to be determined.  PM, Radars estimates a production rate not to exceed six (6) radars per month to include spare and repair parts for production quantities of 150 to 190 EQ-36 Radar Systems with Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) commencing in FY11 and full rate production no later than 3QFY13.  An industry day is planned for 1QFY10 along with the release of the draft RFP.  The final RFP is planned for release during 2QFY10 and proposals due 3QFY10.  Source selection is planned to be completed by 2QFY11.  A planned key factor of the source selection process includes a live ammunition system demonstration. The demonstration is planned to take place at Yuma Proving Grounds (YPG) during 4QFY10 and would require offerors to provide a production representative prototype or better to be evaluated against a published test plan, shot matrix, and the performance requirements.  The shot matrix and test plan will be available at Industry Day.  U.S. Government validated data may be accepted in lieu of participation in the live ammunition system demonstration. Results will be used to evaluate the risk of achieving the required performance in the previously mentioned performance requirements document. To participate in the live ammunition system demonstration, offerors will need to provide all the necessary documentation to obtain frequency assignment for their respective systems in a timely manner if their proposed solution does not have a National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) approved frequency allocation.  Please address any comments/issues associated with the planned live ammunition system demonstration; in particular address ability to provide a demonstration system in the timeframe indicated, ability to show your proposed solution has a Technology Readiness Level (TRL)  e 7, and ability to obtain frequency authorization. <BR><BR>PM, Radars anticipates conducting a production readiness and capacity evaluation at the offerors production facility to assess the realism of achieving the production rate of six (6) radars per month.  Please address any comments/issues associated with achieving the production rate of six (6) radars per month to include the number of months after contact award that this production rate could be achieved.<BR><BR>The successful offeror will be required to have at least one (1) production representative system, two (2) are preferred, available three (3) months after contract award to begin Developmental Testing (DT) followed by a Limited User Test (LUT) conducted by the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) which is planned to be completed within nine (9) months from contract award.

THIS IN NOT A SOLICITATION OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, IT IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.
The Department of Energy awarded a Time and Materials Recovery Act task assignment under an existing competitively award General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedule Task Order to Project Performance Corporation (PPC), supporting the Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management (DOE-EM).  The DUNS and Bradstreet DUNS Number for PPC is 622496230.  This requirement is to have PPC provide commercial software and professional support services to design, configure and implement a unified electronic document management and records management system (EDMS/ERMS) associated with Recovery Act activities.  A Time and Materials contract type was selected because the use of a Fixed Price contract would have added substantial contingency costs that may have been restrictive, unnecessary, and inflated. The total value is $69,926 and the Period of Performance is from September 25, 2009 through January 31, 2010.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACT SUPPORT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT (DOE-EM).
THIS IN NOT A SOLICITATION OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, IT IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.
The Department of Energy awarded a Time and Materials Recovery Act task assignment extension under an existing competitively award General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedule Task Order to Project Performance Corporation (PPC), supporting the Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management (DOE-EM).  The DUNS and Bradstreet DUNS Number for PPC is 622496230.  This requirement is to have PPC modify EM?s Integrated Planning Accountability and Budget System (IPABS) to support ARRA data requirements and provide systems support to ensure data quality for the EM Cleanup work associated with Recovery Act activities.  A Time and Materials contract type was selected because the use of a Fixed Price contract would have added substantial contingency costs that may have been restrictive, unnecessary, and inflated. The total value is $498,980 and the Period of Performance is from September 28, 2009 through January 31, 2010.

<DESC>This action modifies an existing contract to provide funding for ADOPT common infrastructure support. This contract implements and maintains the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program's (CTEP) Enterprise System which includes capturing data and translating it into a usable format to address the scientific, safety, regulatory and administrative needs of CTEP and the NCI in conducting clinical trials; streamlining clinical research operations; improving communication between CTEP and its collaborators; assuring the security and confidentiality of proprietary and patient information; increasing access to clinical trials to all investigators; and, supporting broad patient access to clinical trials and expediting the protocol development and review process within both clinical trial organizations and reviewing bodies.

Rationale for using other than a fixed price:

Uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost reimbursement type action is appropriate. The primary purpose of the contract is to  standardize and create common infrastructure to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the CTEP multi-center clinical trial networks while simultaneously providing an opportunity to reduce clinical trial costs.

<DESC>This action modifies an existing contract to provide funding for ADOPT common infrastructure support.  This contract provides the type of clinical trials support that will be necessary to incorporate new technologies for electronic data capture and verification.  The Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU) is a service of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) that provides clinicians across the United States access to cancer treatment trials.  The project is funded and directed by the NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) and operated by Westat, Inc.  The objectives of the CTSU include:  providing a wide choice of clinical trial options to the largest possible number of investigators; involving a larger number of treating institutions in the clinical trials process; increasing enrollment to cancer clinical trials; streamlining or eliminating redundant processes and procedures; and providing data management services for clinical trials.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rationale for not using a fixed price&nbsp;contract:<br /><br /></span>A fixed price mechanism is not appropriate for this requirement. Although certain elements of the requirement, such as equipment and subcontracts, can and will be procured on a fixed price basis, the complexities of providing personnel and services to enhance clinical research infrastructure are highly variable and dependent on too many external factors to accurately develop a fixed price estimate. For example, different clinical sites may have very different equipment and IT requirements thus the costs to fully develop the infrastructure at each site could vary greatly. Infrastructure and administrative costs could also fluctuate greatly depending on the number of patients anticipated at individual sites. Overall, the level of risk and number of uncertainties make a fixed price contract impractical and likely less cost effective than a cost-type arrangement.<br /><br />This task order was awarded competitively under the existing multiple award contracts HHSN272200900001I/2I/3I.

<p>The purpose of this notice to announce the award of Task Order #0006 to ARGO Systems, LLC (EP-W-07-094) from the Targeted Brownfields Assessments (TBA) Contracts Request For Offer # 32 and to obligate funding in the amount of $99,653.04. The period of performance will be from September 28, 2009 though February 5, 2010.</p>
<p>The contractor shall conduct a Phase I Brownfields Site Assessment and Report, as well as Phase II on-site reconnaissance, Sampling Analysis and Monitoring Plan, Phase II Brownfields Site Investigation, Analysis of Field Investigation Samples, Disposal of Investigation-Derived Waste, and Draft and Final Phase II Site Investigation Reports. A Phase I site assessment was conducted on the Salvation Army property but was limited to the perimeter of the building and no site assessment work has been done on the City of Wilmington property. Consequently, the contractor shall conduct a Phase I ESA which shall serve as the basis for determining the actual nature/extent of the Phase II ESA. The site is located in Wilmington, Delaware.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Brownfields and Land Revitalization (OBLR) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OBLR contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OBLR contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

(EP-W-07-095) from the Targeted Brownfields Assessments (TBA) Contracts Request For Offer # 33 and to obligate funding in the amount of $154,817.72. The period of performance will be from September 28, 2009 though February 12, 2010.</p>
<p>The contractor shall conduct a Phase I Brownfields Site Assessment and Report, as well as Phase II on-site reconnaissance, Sampling Analysis and Monitoring Plan, Phase II Brownfields Site Investigation, Analysis of Field Investigation Samples, Disposal of Investigation-Derived Waste, and Draft and Final Phase II Site Investigation Reports. The overall objective of the Targeted Brownfields Assessment is to: 1) determinate more fully the types and general extent of soil and groundwater contamination on site; 2) determine, using published Pennsylvania State and federal risk-based regulatory standards, the risks posed by contamination; 3) develop potential alternatives for clean-up; and 4) estimate order of magnitude costs of implementing the clean-up alternatives that would help support decision making concerning future redevelopment of the Brownfield site. The site is located in Allentown, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Brownfields and Land Revitalization (OBLR) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OBLR contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OBLR contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>Temperature profiling systems for five locations; each system consists of a single string of temperature thermisters that float on a buoy on the reservoir, which measures the water column temperature profile (stratification).  Data are stored and transmitted to a base station via telemetry (iSIC datalogger).  The District is currently using NexSens ichart software to handle real time data acquisition, local data display, and automatically posting data plots to the web.  Data from thermisters that lie on the lake bottom as the pool elevation falls are automatically removed from the database.  Each system must interface with existing water quality instruments.  These systems include, but are not limited to, data loggers, monitoring buoys, and sonar.
