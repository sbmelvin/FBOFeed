<CONTACT>Steven Streeter, 508-233-6180

<a href="mailto:steve.streeter@us.army.mil">ACC-APG SCRT - Natick (SPS)</a>
<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems Directorate (PM FSS), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: INCINER8 LTD, Balmoral Drive, Southport, Merseyside, GBR.<br><br>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  <br><br>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <br> <br>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <br><br>The Army's Maneuver Support and Sustainment Centers of Excellence have identified safe solid waste disposal as a capability gap in Contingency Basing. To help fill gaps at smaller camps such as 50 and 150- person, Commercial off the shelf (COTS), lightweight, portable incinerators need to be purchased for test and evaluation. A COTS solution is required to reduce cost, schedule, and performance risks associated with this evaluation and future large quantity, competitive procurements. The evaluation will determine if a COTS incinerator is suitable and effective in Contingency Base-camping at sites of 150 persons or less. Criteria for camps of 150 personnel and below include the incinerator must be small enough for it to be transported and set up at the most austere camps where material handling equipment is limited. The incinerator must be able to fit in a single, standard ISO-container, and weigh less than 9500 pounds. Incinerators must also have 2 stages of incineration as a pollution control and be able to treat 400-1200 pounds per day of solid waste. Unlike other waste disposal technologies, incineration is well proven, portable, and exists in the commercial market. Incinerators for camps greater than 150 personnel are not part of the evaluation and those will have different criteria to meet.<br><br>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <br><br>In order to assure an adequate sampling of the commercial market, PMFSS needs to purchase multiple candidate incinerators from several different vendors to verify the general market of COTS incinerators will perform reliably and safely enough to sustain the small base camps. Extensive market research was done in 2010, which will be explained in further detail below. There were only three vendors found in the research that meet all the criteria of paragraph 1 above, because all other incinerators are too large. Several smaller incinerators from Inciner8, Thermtec, and Elastec met the criteria, so one of each is planned to be purchased via separate purchase requests for each vendor. Three, funded, separate purchase requests are currently in process. The incinerators will then be subjected to comparative performance and reliability test and evaluation to lower the performance risk during future large quantity, competitive procurements. . The sole source for this purchase request is Inciner8, which has three different incinerator models that meet the criteria Model A1600X, Model A60, and Model A850(A)2. These three models will be evaluated for camps of 150 persons or below.<br><br><br>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<br><br>Sources Sought Notice W91GVY-FSS-LOE-1-E2 was posted on Fed Biz Ops in March 2010 and responses were delivered to PMFSS by 30 April 2010. In addition to posting the notice, PMFSS also contacted known suppliers of incinerators and informed them of the notice. The notice asked for information regarding incinerators with throughput capacities 500-6000 pounds per day, and a wide range of responses was received. The other sources who have models meeting the criteria are Elastec and Thermtec and their models will also be purchased for evaluation via separate purchase requests (See W91GVY-1145-1047 and W91GVY-1136-1005). Incinerators from the research that do not meet the criteria of less than 9500 pounds or fit in a single container are not being considered for this performance evaluation.<br><br>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<br><br>Market research indicates there are several candidate incinerators that are small enough to transport and effectively treat the solid waste at the 150-person camp and below. The Inciner8 A1600X, A850(A)2, and A60 models are three of them and are specified in this Purchase Request. Purchase requests for the other candidates (Elastec, and Thermtec) from the market research will be placed separately. By evaluating multiple COTS incinerators from various suppliers, the Army will be better able to manage the performance risks when it procures large quantities of production units for use at camps of 150 persons and below.<br><br>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <br><br>The purpose of this effort is only to validate performance of the COTS solution before ordering COTS in large quantities for base camps. Once COTS performance is verified, a detailed performance specification can be completed and multiple vendors will be able to compete for production contracts.<br><br>6. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: steve.streeter@us.army.mil no later than 5:00 PM (EST) on June 16, 2011.<br><br><br>Contracting Office Address: <br>RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick<br>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<br>Kansas Street, Building 1<br>Natick, MA 01760-5011<br><br>Point of Contact:<br>Steven Streeter, Contract Specialist (508) 233-6180<br>steve.streeter@us.army.mil<br><br>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.<br />This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-52.
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This acquisition is being procured using full and open competition.</p>
<p>As part of its research into Si-based quantum dot devices, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a need for a dilution refrigerator measurement system. The experiments that the government wishes to pursue impose the following general requirements: i) dilution refrigerator capable of achieving ultralow temperatures, where the quantum dot effects are maximized: ii) magnetic field, in order to investigate electron spin effects; iii) high-frequency leads, for high-speed pulsing and for fast sensing; iv) low noise (both mechanical and electrical) for doing very sensitive electrical measurements.</p>
<p>All responsible parties shall provide a quotation for all of the following line items.</p>
<p>LINE ITEM 0001: QUANTITY ONE (1) EACH DILUTION REFRIGERATOR, including all of the following components and meeting or exceeding all of the following general and specific requirements.</p>
<p>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:<br />1. Cryogen-free: A system that requires the use of liquid helium shall not be accepted. A system requiring liquid nitrogen is acceptable. The minimum acceptable period of time between liquid nitrogen replenishment is five days. Preference shall be given to longer <br />liquid nitrogen replenishment times;</p>
<p>2. Cooling Power: Minimum cooling power 200 &micro;W at 0.1 K. Preference shall be given to higher cooling power;</p>
<p>3. Cooldown time: The maximum acceptable times are 48 hours for both cool down and warm-up. Preference shall be given for shorter cool down and/or shorter warm-up times;</p>
<p>4. Base temperature: The maximum acceptable temperature is 30 mK. Preference shall be given to systems in which this temperature is lower;</p>
<p>SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS<br />1. High-Frequency Leads: <br />1.1 A minimum of 10 high-frequency cable assemblies are required. The Government will give preference to a system which has a larger number of cable assemblies, up to a maximum of 24. These cable assemblies shall have SMA connectors;<br /><br />1.2 For both attenuation and reflection, the maximum acceptable coefficient is 10 dB at all frequencies up to 2GHz. The Government will give preference to a system in which the coefficients are smaller than 10dB and/or coefficients are specified over a wider frequency range;<br /><br />1.3 Cable assemblies with connectors on both ends between i) top plate and plate near three K; ii) plate near three K and still plate, and iii) still plate and mixing chamber plate shall be provided.<br /><br />1.4 Heat-sinking shall be provided, so that the inner conductor of high-frequency leads at the mixing chamber are at the mixing chamber temperature.</p>
<p>1.5 Cable assemblies shall be provided that have strain relief for semi-rigid cable assemblies that are not already bent, so that it is not necessary to bend a straight assembly in order to remove it or install it.</p>
<p>1.6 Low-frequency leads: At least 24 low-frequency leads, running between the top plate and the mixing chamber, in twisted pairs shall be provided. The Contractor shall provide an electrostatic shield between these leads and all diagnostic (thermometer and heater) wiring. The leads shall be connectorized at the plate near 3 K and at the still plate, as well as at the top plate and the mixing chamber.</p>
<p>1.7 The successful Contractor shall consult with Government regarding length of cables. It is anticipated that NIST will insert attenuators or filters during installation. <br /><br />2. System Size <br />The Government requires a system which is as short (i.e., distance between top plate and floor) as possible. This requirement is important given that, if possible, operation without the need of personnel climbing on ladders is advantageous. The maximum acceptable distance is 3 m. The Government will give preference to a system in which this distance is smaller.</p>
<p>3. Ease of Use<br />The Government prefers, but does not require, a system which can be operated from open to closed to base temperature to room temperature to open by only one person (as opposed to requiring two or more people to operate some or all of the cycle).</p>
<p>4. Vibration: <br />The maximum acceptable amplitude of vibrations is 20 &micro;m at the mixing chamber plate. The Government will give preference to a system in which the amplitude of vibrations is smaller than 20 &micro;m.</p>
<p>5. System Mechanical Support: <br />5.1 The Government requires that the system have the capability to be supported from the ceiling of the room at the Government's discretion. The Contractor shall provide attachment points on the top plate of the system. The Government shall supply the support structure. The design of this support structure is not yet available.</p>
<p>5.2 The Contractor shall also provide its standard floor-based support system.</p>
<p>6. Computer: <br />The Contractor shall not provide a computer with the system. The Contractor shall install, and demonstrate all necessary software on a Government-supplied laboratory computer.</p>
<p>7. Manual/Stand-by Operation:<br />All valves must be able to be operated by manual switches, separate from any computer operation. The Government shall give preference to a system which can be run at base temperature, after the initial cooldown period, with power disconnected from the computer and valve/control panel.</p>
<p>8. Plate Mounting: <br />After award and after Government consultation, the Contractor shall provide mounting holes on all plates. The maximum number of holes on any single plate shall be 30.<br /><br />9. Compressor for Return Line: <br />The Government prefers, but does not require, a system which does not contain a compressor in the high-pressure return line.</p>
<p>If the high-pressure 3He return line has a compressor in it, the quoter shall provide valving that makes it possible to bypass the compressor after the cooldown period, when the refrigerator is operating in its nominal condition at base temperature.</p>
<p>10. Preventive Maintenance: <br />The minimum acceptable time between required preventive maintenance is two weeks. The Government will give preference to a system in which the time is longer than two weeks.</p>
<p>11. Customer Support: <br />The Contractor shall provide free, unlimited, telephone customer support during normal business hours (in offeror's location). This support shall be provided by technical personnel who are experienced with the offered system. Technical personnel shall be required to return calls within one business day;</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br>(ii) Examples.<br>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C.  362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br>(1) Listed End Product<br>Listed End Product:	Listed Countries of Origin:<br>  	  <br>  	  <br>  	  <br>(2) Certification.
