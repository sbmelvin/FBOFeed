<DESC>FAA Software Market Survey The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement to procure the following software from Software AG, 11700 Plaza America Drive, Suite 700, Reston, Virginia, 20190: a)	ADABAS - database management system (DBMS)  b)	ApplinX - web enabling tool c)	ADABAS SQL Server - database software for SQL server  d)	EntireX - system integration tools e)	Natural - programming language  f)	Natural Security - security application  g)	Predict - data dictionary h)	Entire Net-Work - connectivity tools  This software will be used on a UNIX (Solaris) operating system.  The application that will utilize this software is the FAA Logistics Center (FAALC) Logistics & Inventory System (LIS).  LIS is a mission critical system that provides logistics parts and services to the NAS that keeps systems running, such as the radars at major airports.  LIS interfaces with other key systems such as DELPHI, PRISM and the FAALC Warehouse Management System (WMS). LIS currently is hosted on a z/OS IBM mainframe.  FAALC personnel using Software AG products such as Natural for its programming language and ADABAS for its DBMS developed LIS in-house to be hosted on that mainframe.  The FAALC must now migrate LIS software and data from its mainframe host to a UNIX host.  This must consist of changing the operating system without rewriting LIS or changing LIS functionality.  This re-hosting must be seamless to the LIS users.  Software AG products must still be used on the new UNIX host.  These are the only known software products capable of effectively meeting FAA requirements to minimize project risk in areas such as ensuring proper migrated LIS performance, reducing project costs and reducing project completion timelines.  Use of other software would result in the following unacceptable outcomes: a)	Extensive rewrite of the current LIS application (and the DBMS interface/configuration) b)	Rewrite would introduce unacceptable risk to the modified LIS being able to provide its identical original functionality (even if programming language conversion tools were used)  c)	Rewrite would require minimum of 30,000 hours at $3 million d)	Rewrite would delay project completion and LIS (on UNIX) go-live by minimum of 3 years e)	Rewrite that would change current LIS functionality would require user training, lead to customer dissatisfaction and reduce quality of support to the NAS  f)	FAALC would lose approximately $2 million per year in fees for another organization to continue hosting the mainframe based LIS  g)	Use of other than Software AG tools for web enabling, system integration and connectivity would significantly increase project risk, since must use Software AG for the programming language and DBMS The FAA, NAS Contracting Team (AMQ-210), 6500 S. MacArthur Boulevard, P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73125 must receive responses to this market survey, no later than 2:00 p.m. CST, Friday, January 5, 2006.  Hand-carried responses (or responses sent by overnight delivery) shall be delivered to Room 313 of the Multi-Purpose Building located at 6500 South MacArthur Boulevard, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73169.  Responses must be sealed and labeled as follows:  Kelly Tillery, Market Survey No. DTFAAC-07-R-00441; due 2:00 p.m. CST, Wednesday, January 5, 2006.  Responses must include name and telephone number of a point of contact.    The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Final determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>PR Number(s): FD20300748504 Item: 0001 P/N: 1886-280,  Description: This item is used on the F110-129 engine.  It is an electro-hydraulic device with hydraulic amplification with force balance mechanical feedback.  This item receives an external electrical input from the Digital Electrical Control to either increase or decrease fuel flow. This electrical current is applied to the coil(s) shifting the armature which, in turn, moves the control jet off null.  The control jet then directs additional fluid pressure from the supply port to the control port. The additional pressure from the control port moves the pilot valve plunger off  null, causing supply pressure to be ported to the control port.  This additional pressure is directed to the external Main Fuel Servovalve to increase fuel flow through the Main Engine Control/Main Fuel Control.  When the pilot valve moves off null, the feedback rod applies a nullling force to move the control jet back to the null position.  This waiver also applies to any new NSN/PN that supercedes an existing NSN/PN.  To qualify as a superceding NSN/PN covered by the waiver, the superceding NSN/PN must have the same form, fit and function as the original NSN/PN Total Line Item Qty: 12.0000    Destn: FB2039,Tinker AFB,OK.,73145-9013.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for construction services for window and door renovation of the Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

The windows and doors are now over 100 years old and exhibit the condition that results from age and repeated exposure to northern winters, including deteriorated and peeling paint, cracked and rotten wood, missing glazing and worn weather stripping. The intent of this project is to restore the original windows and doors. This restoration will stop ongoing deterioration, improve energy efficiency and enhance the appearance of this historic building. 

The estimated cost of this project falls within the range of $1 million to $5 million, with an expected project duration of a total of 12 months, to be completed in 2 phases (May through October 2007 and May through October 2008). Work for this project is expected to begin in May 2007. A qualified contractor will be selected using a best-value source selection procedure, in accordance with Part 15 of the FAR. All elements of work to be executed must be within congressionally mandated cost limitations. Funds are currently not available for this acquisition. This will be a lump sum, fixed-price contract open to all business concerns in accordance with the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program.

The award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and offers the best value to the Government, considering technical factors and the evaluated price. For this procurement, technical factors will be significantly more important than price.

Small Business Participation: This procurement is open to both large and small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 with a small business size standard of $31 million. Although this procurement is not set aside for small businesses, small firms including women-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned and service disabled veteran-owned businesses are strongly encouraged to participate in this project.

Joint Ventures: Joint ventures or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality contractor team effort.

Proposal Submission Requirement: The Request for Proposal (RFP) package will only be available electronically and is anticipated to be available on January 5, 2007. The RFP will not be available on the FedBizOpps website. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the RFP and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and/or additional information. The RFP cited above can only be obtained by accessing a secure website known as the Federal Technical data Solution (FedTeDS).

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/ OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per  the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

	1.  Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary to order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contracts, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified to each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and include item (d), as necessary:

a.	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license, at a minimum, shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitted; and

b.	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

c.	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

d.	A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBA documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously, or at the time of pick up, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2.  Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter, as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

	3.  Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for what specific time thereafter, as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

	4.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractors record copy, at the time of Release of Claims, to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<RESPDATE>122806
<ARCHDATE>01272007
<CONTACT>Capt Bryan Paton 703-432-4176
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) intends to issue a sole source contract for REMEDY software licenses, maintenance on those licenses, and Senior Consultant services as outlined in Attachment 1.   MARCORSYSCOM intends to award the contract to BMC Software Distribution, Inc., P.O. Box 201040, Houston, TX 77216-1040. BMCs REMEDY software offers integrated packages/modules for the services required to fulfill the Marine Corps Enterprise Networks (MCEN) network common operational picture (NETCOP) requirements.  The REMEDY software package will enable the Marine Corps Network Operations and Security Command (MCNOSC) to leverage the significant assets that have been procured in the past with the Remedy software licenses and services to provide a local network common operational picture (NETCOP) utilizing REMEDY software.  Training on the previously procured assets can be utilized, and already established back-end hardware and software assets (required for REMEDY integration) will have the capability to be utilized, thus extending their lifecycle and reducing total cost of ownership (TCO) on the entire package.  The current local COP assets consist of time-proven REMEDY software and hardware capabilities that set the standard for network COP scenarios.  It is imperative that the Government !  be able to utilize those assets currently in place to integrate with the new requirements to provide a full Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) approach to IT management.  Failure to do so would leave the non-NMCI units without help desk support.  The management and execution, technical support and guidance, familiarity of the engineering staff, and established training on standardized hardware and software, will facilitate the smooth operation and execution of the current COP and should be extended for the implementation of the required NETCOP. It is imperative that MCNOSC not suffer any interoperability issues concerned with this purchase due to hardware or software substitution.  Any disruption would affect the MCNOSC command and control capability as well as every subordinate unit that depends on the MCNOSC for support.  The management and execution, technical support and guidance, familiarity of the engineering staff, and established training on a standardized suite facilitates the smooth operation and execution of the garrison and tactical networks deployed around the globe.   It is paramount that the currently installed REMEDY base not be compromised with a hardware and/or software substitution.  A substitution would result in a loss of the knowledge and expertise gained over the years on the REMEDY products and would require extensive re-training of all individuals involved in the process.  This effort would waste both time and resources and could compromise the current proven infrastructure.  Any new assets purchased must be compatible with current operations, equipment, and training; the MCNOSC cannot entertain substitutions, because such an action will hinder the command and control environment across the entire MCEN.  Additionally, any substitutions would have to be retested to re-achieve accreditations throughout both the MCNOSC and Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC).  The delivery of the software is required NLT 30 days After Receipt of Order (ARO), and delivery of the services will be for approximately six to seven months (beginning 1 Feb 2007).  No RFP is available for competitive bidding, however interested parties are encouraged to submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement no later than 1200 on 28 December 2006 to the contact person listed above.  The applicable NAICS code for this effort is 541511.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.501) with Chiron Corporation, 4560 Horton Street, Emeryville, CA 94608, as the only responsible source that can provide analyzers that will test for HIV, Hepatitis C and West Nile Virus. Based on the above information, the only known item is Procleix TIGRIS System.

Chiron Corporation is the sole manufacturer of the Procleix TIGRIS System. The Chiron Procleix TIGRIS analyzer allows testing via DNA amplification technology for the newly mandated screening for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and West Nile Virus (WNV).  The system contains all materials to implement this requirement minus testing personnel and reagent costs.  Additionally, it will allow for minimal modification of spaces and provides a unique walk-away technology where samples are loaded and run with minimal technical supervision of the process required.  

The equipment must be able to process up to 100 units of whole blood on at least three days per week with minimal technical intervention for specimen throughout.  It must be able to withstand periods of high level production while simultaneously being able to perform within prescribed manufacturer?s guidelines even during periods of relative inactivity up to one week.  

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 334516 with a  Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability, to include proof of distributorship of specified brand name only item(s) in providing the same product. All capability statements received within 15 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a MS Word or Adobe PDF attachment to Sandra Bishop, spbishop@nmlc.med.navy.mil.  Capability statements are due by 1600 (4:00 PM) Eastern Time 05 JAN 2007.  No phone calls accepted.

<DESC>The 853rd Electronic Systems Group (ELSG), 641st Electronic Systems Squadron (ELSS), wishes to identify potential contractors for Land-based JPALS Increment 3 Technology Development (TD).  This increment of Land-based capability must provide fixed and mobile precision approach and landing systems that support 100 ft decision height (DH) and  statute mile (sm) visibility (Category II minima).  The system must also support auto-land capability for suitably equipped aircraft (to include Army, Navy and Air Force aircraft) and must be FAA certifiable (able to pass an FAA flight check).  Land-based JPALS must also support civil interoperability with Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) Category II.  The overarching objective of the TD effort is to identify and mature the critical technologies necessary to support a Category II/III precision approach capability.  These technologies must be matured to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 (reference the DoD Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) Deskbook, dated May 2005).  The preliminary critical technologies are:  Global Positioning System (GPS) Sensor System (antenna, antenna electronics and receiver), the detection and mitigation of GPS threats; navigation solution integrity, and integrity monitoring.  Specific work activities for the Land-based JPALS Increment 3 TD are: (1) Support the development and validation of performance requirements for Category II precision approach.  (2) Support the identification of critical technologies and plans to mature each technology to TRL 6.  (3) Conduct the necessary analysis, modeling and simulation, and testing to mature each critical technology to TRL 6, including performance in the presence of the most current GPS threat environments.

<CONTACT>Donna J Broderick, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 286-8162, Fax (301) 286-6299, Email Donna.J.Broderick@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to contract for a no-cost extension for the continuation of a specialized suite of contracts that supply Information Technology (IT) equipment and software to the Federal Government through a Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) specifically identified as SEWP III. The following contracts are affected by the intended extensions: Contract  NAS5-01133 Hewlett-Packard (HP);  Contract  NAS5-01134 Government Technology Sales, Inc. (GTSI) / Sun Microsystems; Contract  NAS5-01135 IBM;  Contract  NAS5-01138 Government Micro Resources, Inc. (GMR) / Cray;	Contract  NAS5-01139 Hewlett-Packard (HP) / Compaq;  Contract  NAS5-01140 Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI);  Contract  NAS5-01142 Government Technology Sales, Inc. (GTSI);  Contract  NAS5-01144 UNISYS;  Contract  NAS5-01145 Government Micro Resources, Inc. (GMR) NASA GSFC does not intend to increase the maximum ordering value of the contracts.  The effective ordering period is extended for an additional three months beginning January 30, 2007 through April 30, 2007. The contract extensions are required to ensure uninterrupted support and to meet critical requirements until the follow-on competitive contract is awarded.  This procurement action is being conducted in accordance with 10 U.S.C.	2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  The highly specialized nature of the SEWP III contracts combined with the highly automated and optimized acquisition schedule enable customers to get critical items for a wide diversity of projects and programs not obtainable elsewhere in the Federal Government within the required time frame.  SEWP, unlike any other available GWAC, is centered around high-end, state of the art technology.	While many general commodity, low-priced (under $2500) items exist on SEWP, the urgency of extending SEWP III until SEWP IV is in place is in the availability of the newer, higher priced technology, which is both more critical and difficult to obtain in a timely fashion elsewhere.  Delay in the award of the extensions of the SEWP III contracts will result in serious injury to major Government programs by either the unavailability of the required hardware/software and/or additional financial cost.  It is not practical or cost effective to conduct a full and open competition for three months of support as a precursor to the award of a follow-on contract.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 5, 2007.  Interested organizations must provide documentation which establishes its capability in the required areas including documentation of past relevant experience.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<ARCHDATE>02052007
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Rebecca Hindin, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 564-1266
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541511   The United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) National Decontamination Team intends to award a sole source acquisition to the University of Iowa, Department of Chemistry Optical Science and Technology Center under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-3.  The primary purpose of this acquisition is to support the Airborne Spectral Photometry of Environmental Contaminants Technology (ASPECT) program in expanding the automated spectral signature identification for the FT-IR systems onboard the EPA ASPECT aircraft.  Background:  EPA's ASPECT project focuses  on spectral technologies to remotely detect chemical and radiological vapors, plumes, and clouds.   EPA operates the ASPECT system in support of local, State and Federal first responders.  The detection systems being used rely on unique hardware and software components.  The overall system  configuration has been designed and optimized to provide the response community with standoff detection, imaging and mapping of chemical and radiological plumes from various sources such as facilities, transports, and other hazardous material release situations.  The three main hardware components  consist of a geo-registered high-speed infrared line scanner, a fast scanning FT-IR spectrometer and a gamma-ray spectrometer.  These components are integrated with commercially available digital cameras, air-to-ground telemetry links, and various systems control computers.  The entire instrument  package is mounted in the passenger cabin of an aircraft uniquely suited for remote sensing applications.  The detection systems, controls, computers, and monitors are mounted on specially designed racks installed in the aircraft cabin.  A custom designed aircraft power buss supplies the required  power for all of the above systems.  Description of Work:  The contractor shall provide to the EPA ASPECT program automated spectral signature detection software filter upgrades.  The principal focus of the work will be chemical specific filters to install into the specialized software used by the  ASPECT system for rapid, automated chemical detection.  These software filters will be loaded into the software user interface to the data processing computer aboard the ASPECT response aircraft.  These filters will improve the speed and reliability of the system to detect specific chemical  signatures while responding to emergency response actions. Demonstration of Contractor Qualifications:  The intended contractor, the University of Iowa, Department of Chemistry Optical Science and Technology Center, has unique qualifications and experience necessary for successful completion of  this work, including:  ASPECT Spectral Signature Pattern Recognition:  The personnel available through the University of Iowa, Department of Chemistry Optical Science and Technology Center initially developed the data processing techniques designed for the outputs from the ASPECT MR254AB sensor.   The intended contractor currently is in possession of significant volumes of previously collected data from the ASPECT sensors that are critical to the development of chemical specific filters for incorporation into the pattern recognition software program.  Specifically there is a large amount of  background data sets used to develop pattern recognition coefficients for these chemical signature recognition filters.  The intended contractor is one of only two known existing resources with expertise and experience in the development and upgrading of the chemical signature recognition software  being used by the ASPECT program.  The second resource is unavailable to perform the needed tasks.  The chemical signature recognition techniques applied by the ASPECT program deviate significantly from the widely practiced techniques being applied by other similar federal and commercial  organizations.  At this time the ASPECT sensor package has no equivalent commercially and no other vendor has developed the necessary skills to produce the spectral signatures data processing programs that are required..EPA has been determined that the University of Iowa, Department of Chemistry  Optical Science and Technology Center is the only viable source to meet the Government's requirements.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirements as stated herein may submit a response, which if  received with 15 calender days of the date of this announcement will be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing.  A determination not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions  should be directed to Rebecca Hindin via e-mail at hindin.rebecca@epa.gov.  For information regarding the Statement of Work, please refer to EPA's Office of Acquisition Management website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/.

<DESC>NAICS Code 541710 ? Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences ? SBA size standard is 1000 for this code.  The purpose of this pre-solicitation notice is to announce The Global Positioning System Wing (GPSW), Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC)?s planned activities for the progressive competition and down-selection for the acquisition and production (Phases B/C and D) of the Global Positioning System (GPS) Modernized Space Receiver (MSR) program as described in Request for Proposal (RFP) FA8807-05-R-0001 dated 20 April 2006 and as amended via RFP Amendments 0001-0006 issued 19 May 2006, 01 June 2006, 23 June 2006,  21 July 2006, 08 August 2006, and 29 August 2006, respectively.  GPS MSR is a phased acquisition; Phase A includes trade studies and refinement of the Technical Requirements Documents and the Protection Profile.  Phase A has a 9-month period of performance from 28 September 2006 through completion of System Design Review (SDR).  The requirements of Phase B/C include the development and delivery of 5 Developmental Flight Units (DFUs) that are flight worthy, 5 Engineering Developmental Units (EDUs) for early testing in the laboratory, and 15 MSR classified algorithmic digital chips for security certification activities.  The period of performance for Phase B/C is 36 months after contract award of Phase B/C.  Phase D includes annual production options with the Government?s minimum requirements of two MSR units each year.  The period of performance for Phase D is 2010 through 2020.  Throughout Phases B/C and D, the Government may also procure Developmental Flight Units (DFU) Support, Production Flight Unit (PFU) Support, as well as Special Studies and Classified Special Studies as necessary for the MSR Program. 

RFP FA8807-05-R-0001 resulted in contract awards to General Dynamics C4 Systems, Inc. and ITT Industries Space Systems, LLC for Phase A activities.  The RFP and resulting contract awards provide for a down-select to a single contract.  The Call for Improvements (CFI) RFP envisioned in the down-select is scheduled for release on or about 27 April 07.  The CFI RFP will include complete proposal preparation instructions and proposal evaluation criteria.  To be competitive, potential offerors for Phases B/C and D that are not incumbents must be able to clearly demonstrate their capability to perform the Phases B/C and D work and demonstrate system maturity necessary to successfully perform the subsequent Phases.  To meet the requirements of the CFI RFP for the down-select, potential offerors who are not currently performing Phase A contracts will be required to include in their proposals the same contractual documents required by RFP FA8807-05-R-0001 and RFP Amendments 0001-0006.  Specific information and instructions with respect to these documents are contained in RFP FA8807-05-R-0001 and RFP Amendments 0001 through 0006 thereto.   These and other GPS program documents are available to all potential offerors for the down-select in the MSR Bidder?s Library.   To gain access to the MSR Bidder?s Library contact Ms. Jamie Moos at (310) 726-1669 or by e-mail at jemoos@arinc.com.  In addition to establishing a Bidder?s Library account, potential Offerors desiring to access MSR documentation from the Bidder?s Library must have the following Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) components: (a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or (b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html).  Any questions in regards to obtaining a CAC or ECA, should be directed Mr. John Pezan at (310) 653-3208 or by email at john.pezan@losangeles.af.mil.  The approximate timeframe for processing a CAC or ECA is eight (8) weeks.  The process time for access to the MSR Bidder?s Library website is approximately one (1) week for Offerors currently possessing a CAC or ECA.  

In order to demonstrate an offeror?s technical capability and system maturity, competitors (including those not currently performing on MSR Phase A contracts) will be required to perform a SDR as required in RFP FA8807-05-R-0001.  The MSR SDR will be a review to ensure that the offeror?s proposed MSR can proceed into preliminary design and that all system requirements and functional performance requirements reflected in the Technical Document (TRD)/Protection Profile (PP), as updated through the results of the trade analysis conducted during Phase A by the Requirements Technical Interchange Working Group (RTIWG), are defined. Further, the SDR will ensure that those system and functional performance requirements are consistent with program budget, schedule, risk and other system constraints.  The SDR will determine whether the MSR functional definition is decomposed to a level sufficient to begin preliminary design.  Completion of the demonstration shall provide:
1. An established system functional baseline;
2. An MSR risk assessment;
3. A System/Subsystem Description Document (SSDD), and; 
4. A program development schedule including hardware and software critical path drivers.
5. Results of trade studies, to include Cost As an Independent Variable (CAIV) trades. 
A successful SDR shall be predicated upon the Government's determination that the MSR performance requirements and plans for design and development form a satisfactory basis for proceeding into preliminary design.

Time for SDR has tentatively been set-aside on 10-12 July 07 and the SDR will take place at the offeror?s facility.  Details for scheduling the SDR will be included in the CFI RFP.  

As stated in Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award (page 1), RFP FA8807-05-R-0001, and Section H ? Special Contract Requirements (SCR), SMC ? H014 of the resulting contracts, the criteria for the Government?s selection of the best overall offer will include best value assessment of the CFI proposal, innovation and cost justification demonstrated in Trade Studies, successful completion of design review with a robust, compliant, and low risk design for development and production, successful compliance with all contract requirements, responses to the Government provided Engineering Process Questionnaire (EPQ), responsive and effective management, and technical competence.  The Government reserves the right to change these evaluation criteria at any time.  Specific evaluation criteria will be provided in the Government?s CFI RFP.  

Information associated with the MSR Program may be classified up to SECRET.  Offerors and their teammates interested in competing will be required to have a minimum of SECRET facility clearance and personnel cleared to the SECRET level prior to award of the resultant contract.  Only offers submitted by U.S.-owned companies performing within the continental United States or its territories will be considered for award.   

This pre-solicitation notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered a request to submit proposal or otherwise by considered as a commitment by the Government.  To aid in planning and scheduling events with respect to the down-select competition, request offerors (other than those currently performing Phase A contracts) interested in competing, provide the Government with a Statement of Interest and Capability (SIC).  The SIC should describe the prospective offeror?s team, each team member role in the MSR program, capabilities of each member of the team, experience of each team member in performing efforts each team member will be proposed to provide.  At a minimum, the SIC should cover (1) military GPS receiver development, (2) space-qualified GPS receiver development, and (3) GPS M-code.  SICs shall be no more than ten pages and shall be submitted to SMC/GPSW/PK (ATTN: Ms. Cathy Butler, 483 N. Aviation, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808 or via email to cathy.butler@losangeles.af.mil.  Responses to this notice must be received not later than 30 calendar days after initial publication in FedBizOps.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOUCE PROCUREMENT FOR PROGRAM TITLE.  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/IFGD) intends to initiate award discussions with the intent to make an award, based upon other than full-and-open competition, in accordance with 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), to Johns Hopkins University-Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU-APL), Baltimore, Maryland.  The overall objective of this acquisition is to develop a design and implement a bi-directional optical interface between a high speed router in a L3 Communications data link terminal and an AOptix Corporation Free Space Optical Communications (FSOC) terminal, accomplish the integration of the optical interface at the AOptix facility in Campbell CA, and provide technical support for testing at Campbell CA (up to a total of four weeks during the period 1 Apr 06 to 1 Jul 06) and extended free space range testing in Hawaii at a separation distance of approximately 150 Km (four consecutive weeks during the period Aug-Sep 06).  The optical interface will provide  reliable transfer of information between the two terminals, provide a wavelength translation from the 1310 nm source on the router to the 1550 nm band used by the FSOC terminal, provide the high signal-to-noise ratio optical transmit signal required for long distance FSOC, provide an optical automatic gain control (AGC) function for the receive side to reduce the variations in the magnitude of the optical fades at a rate equivalent or greater than the fade frequency to condition the amplitude to the required range of the optical interface of the router interface, and provide wavelength division multiplexed optical channels to provide multiple channel operation on the FSOC link.  The contractor shall also provide a second interface/optical modem to provide bi-directional communications between the terminals at the other end of the free space communications link.  Johns Hopkins University is the sole source provider of the high dynamic range optical modems that can be used to provide the optical interfaces between the RF data link terminal and a FSOC terminal, provide the required optical frequency translations, provide the wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) signals for multiple channel operation, and meet the test schedule in Campbell CA in Apr-Jun 2006 and comprehensive testing in Hawaii in Aug-Sep 2006.  This proposed AFRL/IF effort will address combining RF and optical communications, conditioning optical signals with high dynamic range optical modems, and accomplishing reliable free space multiple channel communications in extended range testing.  Other business opportunities for the Air Force Research Laboratory are available at www.fedbizopps.gov.  Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>SUBJECT: NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT DESC: Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, it is the Governments intent to award a sole source to Promega Corporation, 2800 Woods Hollow Road, Madison WI 53711, for the purchase of DNA reagents.  The estimated value of this requisition, including four one- year option periods, is $3,998,057. The Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory (AFDIL) is an American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors (ASCLD) accredited forensic lab.  With the accreditation, our strict guidance is to adhere strictly to establish ed Quality Assurance (QA) and Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to include consistency and continuity of test procedures.  After validating a product, it is set to be used exclusively throughout the forensic identification.  Validation and using various p roducts in not possible from this point because it violates the consistency and continuity of obtaining accurate test results.  This is not a formal solicitation.  This synopsis is not considered a Request for Quotation or Proposal.  No solicitation docume nt is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous  to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the purchase will be awarded without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the G overnment.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the following email address no later than 4:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, 5 January 2007.   EMAIL:  elayne.seiler@amedd.army.mil Please see below for Justification for other than Full and Open Competition JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION JUSTIFICATION 1.  Requiring Activity: Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP), Washington, DC         Contracting Agency:  U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, Fort         Detrick, MD  21702-5014 2.  Description of Action:  This Justification and Approval is being requested for a 5-year requirements contract using Defense Health Research funds. 3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  The required reagents and supplies are used to support the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory (AFDIL) mission in amplification and extraction procedures for DNA identification.  The estimated value of this req uisition, including four one-year option periods, is $3,998,057. PowerPlex 16 system is a multiplex STR system used in DNA typing, including paternity testing, forensic DNA analysis, human identity testing and tissue culture identification. DNA IQ particles are used to purify DNA from a number of difficult sample types, commonly found at crime scenes using either manual or automated approaches. Tissue and Hair Extraction Kit when used in conjunction with the DNA IQ system, is designed to purify double-stranded or single-stranded DNA from tissue and hair samples. The Slicprep device allows solid material to be incubated with a solution in a basket that is placed in a deep-well plate. 4.  Authority Cited:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The FAR citation is 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), and the FAR citation title is, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will  Satisfy the Agency Requirements.   5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  Although there are comparable products in the market, Promega is the sole manufacturer of the PowerPlex 16 system, DNA IQ system, the Tissue and Hair Extraction kit, and the Slicprep device that were specifically made to wo rk in conjunction with our operational machines.   6.  Efforts to obtain Competition:  Not applicable. No effort will be made to solicit offers from as many pote ntial sources as practical since there is only one source capable of providing the supplies and reagents for our requirement.  For example, the lack of Penta D and E from other comparable products for the Power Plex16, such as, the Identifiler of Applied B iosystems, does not meet our requirement. 7.  Actions to increase Competition:  Any future competition requires various validation procedures involving significant man-hours and efforts by the scientists.  Validation and research may last 6 to 8 months during which time the normal daily operation of forensic identification will be suspended.  Furthermore, validation of a product oftentimes requires the consensus of various forensic teams worldwide.  AFDIL is an accredited forensic lab.  With the accreditation, our strict guidance is to adhere stric tly to established Quality Assurance (QA) and Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to include consistency and continuity of test procedures.  After validating a product, it is set to be used exclusively throughout the forensic identification.  Validation and  using various products is not possible from this point because it violates the consistency and continuity of obtaining test results. 8.  Market Research:  Prior to the decision to implement a product into the laboratory at AFDIL, extensive studies are performed to determine which product possesses the desired properties.  Reagents and consumables are compared and tested for sensitivity,  consistency, cost, and compatibility with existing instrumentation used in the lab.  The DNA IQ, for example, was researched, not only by AFDIL but various forensic teams.  It was developed specifically for the forensic community, and is the only material  of its kind to have been validated in a number of forensic laboratories worldwide to purify DNA and to remove inhibitors of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) process from the sample.  AFDIL tests and compares each product used and makes its decision bas ed on its internal studies and on the studies of international forensic community. 9.  Interested Sources.  Not Applicable. 10.  Other Facts:  The DoD DNA Registry, through the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory (AFDIL), provides DNA analysis and human remains identification data to multiple agencies within the Department of Defense.  The primary mission is to support t he Office of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner in their role to properly identify and return fallen US service members throughout the world.  AFDIL not only works on identification cases but also on evidences to be presented in criminal trials in courts na tionwide, as well as worldwide.  All reagents and consumables used in the laboratory need to be approved for use in processing forensic cased work based on Fry and Dalbert Hearings.

<DESC>The Department of Defense requires additional effort for continuation of the development, operational testing, and implementation of a Law Enforcement Technical Center (LETC) for Iraq.  The Government intends to award this effort to Technical and Man agement Services Corporation (TAMSCO). TAMSCO and its subcontractors designed, integrated and tested the LETC and are implementing the LETC under Contract W9113M-05-C-0139. The Government has determined that award of this effort to any other source would r esult in duplication of costs to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing implementation of the LETC. The period of performance is through 30SEP07 and will be added by modification to existing Contract W9113M-05-C-0139.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals to the U. S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, P.O. Box 1500, Huntsville, AL 35807-3801, ATTN: SMDC-RDCM-AK/Koger.

The pads shall be quickly and easily donned and doffed over boots and uniforms.  The KEPS shall be capable of being ambidextrous and shal l be available in small, medium, and large sizes. The KEPS are intended to provide protection for the knees and elbows of Soldiers while they are engaged in tasks that subject these areas to discomfort caused by impacts or pressure.  The KEPS shall protect  from protruding objects and debris (e.g. rocks, gravel, glass) and not restrict range of motion or circulation while remaining securely in place during individual movement tactics. Under impact loading conditions, the padding shall demonstrate a non-shock  type response.  Under constant compression loading conditions, the padding shall deflect minimally and quickly recover to near original thickness.  The fastening system should provide a secure, continuously contoured fit during movement and repositioning.   There should be an outer, non-slip cap to protect from protruding objects.

<DESC>12.21.06:  This modification is posted to correct the "response due date," previously set for 17 NOV 2006.  That date was relevant to an IVL solicitation; however, the date continued to show on subsequent postings even though no longer relevant.  The current date of 12.31.2099 is simply an override designed to convey that there is no current relevant due date, as the system will not allow no date.  The timeline for the solicitation remains as published in other documents, and is subject to change.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on line (NECO) site at https://www.neco.navy.mil/. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case that FBO is not available.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Division Crane. AMENDMENT 2 The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division requires Miniature Day/Night Sight subsystems for Crew-Served Weapons (MDNS-CSW).  A five year indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity contract is anticipated; expected quantity is a minimum of 15 units and a maximum of 3000 units.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination NSWC-Crane.  Fifteen (15) units required 150 days from award date of contract with subsequent deliveries at a rate of 200 units every 30 days until order is complete.  Preliminary inspection will occur at source by a Government QAR and final inspection and acceptance will be at destination by NSWC Crane personnel.  This solicitation will be issued on a full and open competition basis using a performance specification. The MDNS-CSW required is a system of common, standardized aiming modules, illumination modules, and mounts that are system-integrated for use on crew-served weapons.  Prior public Market Survey activity on MDNS-CSW occurred pursuant to two previous NSWC Crane announcements: N00164-06-R-4887 WEAPONS QUADRANT MOUNTS (WQM) and N00164-06-R-4803 CREW SERVED AND HEAVY WEAPONS AIMING LASER (CSHWAL).  The original Market Surveys can be downloaded by clicking on the foregoing links; then entering the announcement numbers in the Search by Solicitation / Award Number block in the provided form.  No Performance Specification for the WQM is yet prepared.  A Preliminary Draft of the Performance Specification for the CSHWAL, dated April 25th, 2006, remains posted, but is closed for receipt of comments.  Market Survey results and field trials of commercial offerings in July 2006 revealed that no known existing laser meets the requirements for the CSHWAL.  Also revealed was that the future!   CSHWAL and WQMs need to be fully system integrated with a Visible Bright Light-Heavy (VBL-H).  Therefore, NSWC Crane has developed a new Performance Specification that unifies the CSHWAL, VBL-H, and WQMs subsystem capabilities into an integrated MDNS-CSW system.  The MDNS-CSW Revised Performance Specification will be published on or about December 2006-January 2007.  When it is published, interested parties are invited to comment on the MDNS-CSW Revised Performance Specification.  The Closing Date for receipt of comments on the MDNS-CSW Revised Performance Specification is Friday, 27 April 2007. NSWC Crane will hold a public pre-solicitation conference for the MDNS-CSW acquisition.  The tentative date for this pre-solicitation conference is Sunday, 14 January 2007, in Orlando, Florida.  Attendees must register for this conference with the Contracting Officer no later than Friday, 5 January 2007.  No additional attendees will be accepted for this conference after Friday, 5 January 2007, in order to accommodate the correct seating capacity at the conference site.     It is expected that the competitive solicitation will require offerors to submit two product samples, technical, past performance and price proposals.  Award will be on a best value basis.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet @ www.ccr.gov. It should be noted that during the course of this acquisition program, the Government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Wexford Group International (WGI) and possibly other direct Government contractors as advisors to the Government participants.  This sources sought announcement does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement or incurred for participation in the pre-solicitation conference will NOT be reimbursed.  Any information provided that is marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to !  non-government personnel and entities.

The basic contract period will be for 12 months. Each contract contains nine (9) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 120 months. The Government will not synopsize the options.  The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is $90,000,000.  The contract will end when 120 months is reached, or when $90,000,000 for all contracts combined is reached, whichever occurs first.  This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices.  The task order range for this contract is between $2,500 and $8,000,000.  Task orders may fall below or above this limit; however contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract.  The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the Government through issuance of a task order.  After award of the initial contract(s), each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order, except under those circumstances described in the contract.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered to each awardee under the performance period of the contract. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.

Factor 1 - Experience
Factor 2 - Past Performance 
Factor 3 - Technical Approach

Relative Importance of the Evaluation Factors: The evaluation factors are divided into two categories; non-price evaluation factors (Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5) and price (Factor 6).

The importance of price will increase if offerors non-price proposals are considered essentially equal in terms of technical quality, or if price is so high as to significantly diminish the value of a proposal?s technical superiority to the Government.

<SUBJECT>R -- TECD CREDIT CARD PROGRAM
<SOLNBR>S-AQMPD-07-R-0001
<RESPDATE>013107

<CONTACT>Pete Jones, Contract 0fficer, Phone 7038756273, Fax 7038756085, Email jonespw@state.gov
<DESC>The service provider shall provide the necessary products and services to accomplish all of the requirements stated herein.
The Office of Foreign Missions (OFM) in the Department of State seeks to institute a credit and/or debit card based system to manage its obligation for providing diplomatic tax-relief privileges for foreign diplomatic missions, international organizations and their members throughout the United States.  This new system will be referred to as the Diplomatic Tax-Exempt Credit/Debit (TECD) Program.    

OFM seeks from the private sector proposals for the provision of diplomatic tax-relief privileges initiated through the use of a provider issued ?tax-exempt? credit and/or debit card to foreign missions, international organizations and their eligible personnel.  ?Tax-Exempt? means vendors should exempt or remove charges associated with most taxes on purchases made using such cards.  The U.S. government will not underwrite or assume any liability for these credit/debit cards, and also will not guarantee payment of the debts on these credit cards. All risk in extending credit will fall on the credit issuer.  

OFM hopes to eventually provide diplomatic tax-relief privileges solely through a credit/debit card-based system.  However, it accepts that technological and programmatic issues stand as current obstacles to achieving this vision.   Therefore, this credit/debit card will serve as one of two systems that OFM will make available to the foreign mission and international organization community for obtaining diplomatic tax.  OFM estimates that such credit/debit cards will be used frequently and will likely have a higher average use-rate in comparison to those issued to average consumers.  

The tax-exemption identification cards that OFM currently produces will continue to exist as an option for the provision of diplomatic tax-relief privileges.  However, the option to use the existing system will only be available to certain individuals.  Therefore, the majority of the diplomatic and international community will receive their tax-relief benefits through the TECD Program.  Each mission/organization will have the option of using either the existing tax-exemption identification card system or the new TECD Program.  In the event the selected bank is unable to provide services to a mission/organization or their members, they will be able to use the existing system.   

There are roughly 9,000 diplomatic tax-exemption cards currently circulating throughout the United States.  

The provision of this service will attract the operating accounts of many foreign missions and international organizations as well as their members to the bank selected for this program.  Therefore, service providers stand to generate new revenues not only from providing this system, but also through the added customer and deposit base that goes along with providing banking services to such account holders.  

As a point of reference concerning the credit worthiness of foreign missions and their members, in conjunction with participating oil companies, OFM has provided ?tax-exempt? gasoline credit cards to foreign missions and diplomats since the mid-1980s.  Although, the tax-relief mechanism used with this card is vastly different from the one described in this document, the extension and management of credit to foreign missions and their members is basically identical.   Over the past 20 years, the service providers of the ?tax-exempt? gasoline credit cards have reported extremely few problems concerning foreign missions or their members as routinely delinquent or unable to pay balances on such accounts.  A list of the oil companies that participate in the ?tax-exempt gasoline credit card program can be viewed on the OFM website at www.state.gov/ofm/tax/gasoline/24625.htm.  

OFM will permit the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) to participate in the TECD program to facilitate its responsibility to provide tax-relief privileges to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States (TECRO) and its members.  These privileges are established under the Taiwan Relations Act (PL 96-8) of April 10, 1979.   AIT will serve most of the roles/responsibilities identified for OFM in this document.  

This solicitation not only offers the opportunity for service providers to present a solution to OFM?s business process needs for a credit and/or debit card based diplomatic tax relief program, but to propose added services that might realize the Department of State?s vision of electronic and streamlined government business processes, both domestically and abroad.

Currently, OFM plans to offer this opportunity to all service providers capable of meeting or exceeding the requirements established in this document.   

Background of the Diplomatic Tax Exemption Process:
The Foreign Missions Act of 1982 (22 USC 4301-4316) requires that OFM manage the U.S. Government?s provision of certain diplomatic privileges on the basis of reciprocity.  The U.S. Government?s obligation to provide diplomatic tax relief is primarily a result of both the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.  However, this privilege is also an obligation of various other bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements, such as the United Nations Headquarters? Agreement. 

The authority to authorize TECRO and its members for tax-relief privileges is an obligation of AIT in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act (PL 96-8) of April 10, 1979.      

Due to the reciprocity requirement in the Foreign Missions Act, OFM is required to provide foreign missions with diplomatic tax relief privileges to the extent that each counterpart foreign government provides such relief to the U.S. diplomatic mission and its members.  Therefore, OFM limits or denies tax exemption to missions that limit or deny tax relief to U. S. diplomatic representatives in the host countr

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Citrix Licenses.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. 3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the Citrix Licensing product as a key component of the Departments OpenNet Everywhere (ONE) networking server farm.

The Citrix licenses provide access to the Citrix server farm located within the Department of State for remote dial-in from posts and or stations throughout the U.S. and abroad. 4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. The 41USC 253(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority. 5. A demonstration that the proposed contractors unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name here in have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments ONE networking infrastructure. 9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition. The ONE Network infrastructure is a Citrix environment, and any deviations to the Citrix licenses would pose technical anomalies that could potentially interrupt the availability of the remote servers to the Department of State employees.  The goal of the Department is to form a cohesive network infrastructure where resources will be better and more easily remotely accessed.<BR><BR>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning  Purposes (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of  this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except  as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection  31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for  Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall  not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of identifying potential  sources capable of implementing commercial knowledge management techniques  and processes that allow knowledge gained from the past to be applied to  current and future projects, programs, and systems. 1.0	DESCRIPTION This is an announcement of a Request for Information (RFI).    This RFI is  issued for the purpose of identifying potential sources capable of  implementing commercial knowledge management techniques and processes that  allow knowledge gained from the past to be applied to current and future  projects, programs, and systems. This is not a solicitation.  This is a  market survey.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal,  nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition  approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not reimburse any costs for providing any information,  documentation, and/or data submitted or preparation costs for submittals  in response to this RFI. 2.0	BACKGROUND INFORMATION Air Force Knowledge Now (AFKN) has been identified by the Air Force Chief  Information Officer (AF CIO) as the Air Force Center of Excellence for  Knowledge Management (AFCOEKM) within the Air Force. The Air Force  definition of knowledge management is the strategies and processes of  identifying, capturing, and leveraging knowledge and expertise within an  organization." To be efficient, knowledge management must allow the user  to take advantage of information technology solutions while creating a  supportive, collaborative, and sharing culture. Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) currently maintains the AFKN system.  Multiple components are integrated to contribute to Air Force Knowledge  Management (KM).  The amount of information generated and needed by the  Air Force workforce and the demographic changes facing this workforce  cause us to constantly evaluate how this online knowledge is managed. We  recognize that in order to meet our Air Force strategic business  objectives, we must get this knowledge quickly and easily to each  individual in a manner that relates to that individuals job  responsibilities. The AFKN team in HQ AFMC/A8 has been leading the way in implementing a  proof-of-concept framework of a future that integrates strategy, mission,  culture, technology, and people.  The enabling concept associated with  this strategy is called Knowledge-Centric Operations (KCO).   The Long War  of the new century requires all of our resources to jointly work in  concert across the value chainthe extended kill-chain.  High performance  will only result from high levels of collaboration, innovation, learning,  and knowledge sharing across temporal, geographical, cultural, and  functional boundaries.  Continuous innovation is required to enable  warfighters, who must draw real time from all five domains as they close  and engage the enemy.  Warfighters need clean data, accessible  information, relevant expertise/knowledge, and keen foresight to not only  strike from the Air, Space, Land, Sea, and Cyberspace, but to also sustain  superiority. The KCO Enabling Concept is designed to spur the continuous adaptation and  reorientation of a truly integrated force that is innovative, more agile,  more rapidly deployable, and more capable of engaging a wider range of  threats.  With KCO, organizations and communities focus on learning by  managing their warfighter know-how, adapting to the always-changing needs  of the extended kill-chain, and excelling in both routine and non-routine  activities so the joint team can dominate the 21st Century battle space. The AFCOEKM researches, identifies and evaluates collaborative and  knowledge sharing capabilities and technology to employ in Air Force  organizations and processes.  They employ a methodology through maturity  and services models to engage Air Force organizations to effect cultural  change and implement process improvements in line with KM principles  founded in industry and academia. 2.1	Air Force Knowledge Now (AFKN) Technology.  The AFCOEKM developed a  simple web-based environmentknown as AFKNto begin to eliminate  organizational barriers, effect process changes, and transition the Air  Force to a knowledge sharing culture from the bottom up.  AFKN utilizes a  Community of Practice (CoP) model to initiate knowledge sharing at the  lowest levels of Air Force organization.  CoPs are shared spaces that  allow members of a group(s) to share information and administrative and  communications tools to conduct business, keep abreast of important group  issues and solve group problems.  CoPs provide an ideal means of  coordinating activities within a group of people or a communityconnecting  people to content and people to people to transfer knowledge. 2.2	Acquiring New Technologies and Capabilities.  The Air Force will  continue to partner with Government, industry and academia to identify  emerging KM technologies and services.  Additionally, the AFCOEKM will  define Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) for legacy and emerging  systems to integrate with, and be accessible from, the collaboration  environment. 2.3	A Learning Experience.  The AFCOEKM facilitates constantly-evolving  team-based learning at every level of the Air Force.  As boundary-less  knowledge sharing becomes synonymous with Air Force culture, the Air Force  will transform into a learning organization.  The learning organization  supports the strategy of a functionally-driven culture of thinkers  One  Team  always learning and always evolving with One Mind to accomplish One  Mission. 2.4	KM Services.  The AFCOEKM will continue to develop and refine its  methodology and services to place and sustain Air Force organizations on  the leading edge of collaboration, knowledge sharing, and continuous  process improvement. The Air Force Information Strategy Goal 7:Implement knowledge management  practices and technologies to assure knowledge is identified, captured and  shared, was issued to specifically address this challenge.  The Air Force  Information Resource (IR) Flight Plan includes this goal and issues the  following objectives: 	Identify and adopt knowledge management best practices and technologies 	Facilitate identification, capture, transfer, and sharing of knowledge  sources and/or content 	Foster ongoing integration of new knowledge into work practices. Simply stated, the goal is to capture knowledge and manage it.  Stating it  simply, however, is an understatement.  Gartner, one of the worlds  leading information technology research and analysis providers, stresses,  It is interesting to note that most of an enterprises knowledge is tacit  (as much as 80 percent to 90 percent of what a person knows will never be  captured).   Captured knowledge is limited and can at best only provide a  baseline reference for performance or decision making.  Even if the  knowledge in question has been accurately captured, nuances associated  with actually performing a task proficiently or with making a more  informed decision are not included.  These more subtle aspects, the keys  to efficiency and effectiveness, remain in the minds of those individuals  who have experience performing the task or with those who were involved in  the decision-making process at the time the knowledge was captured.  This  is why most personnel prefer turnover time with incumbents (versus being  given a continuity book) when assuming new positions. 2.5	Tapping Tacit Knowledge.  Capturing knowledge and managing it is only  part of the KCO military challenge.  The larger challenge, and the one  with the greatest potential benefit to airmen and commanders at all  levels, is the challenge of tapping tacit knowledgethe personal  practices, experience and expertise found in the minds of individuals.  The objective here is not to explicitly capture knowledge for the purpose  of managing it, but to provide capabilities which allow airmen to reach  knowledge experts or professional expertise to accelerate and enhance  situational performance and decision-making to achieve mission  objectivesjust-in-time. The desired effect is to implement and expand knowledge sharing Air Force  wide to break down barriers and help Air Force functional areas work in  concert to support national objectives. A process is composed of the business practices that are used to apply  capabilities to produce effects.   Processes are keys to fusing  intellectual capital in functional areas through to produce the desired  effects needed by airmen and commanders.  They allow KCO to be flexible  and responsive by creating a solution-set of the right capabilities for  the effect that is needed. Below is an alphabetized list (not all-inclusive) of common collaborative  capabilities currently employed with KM solutions or as KM solution-sets  in industry or academia.  These capabilities are conduits for intellectual  capital that enable cross-cutting information sharing. 	Application and Document Sharing.  Usually combined with instant  messaging capabilities to enable people to share computer software  applications and files during a real-time conversation. 	E-Learning.  An element of education performed with personal computers,  CD-ROMs and/or the Internet.  This includes email, discussion groups and  other collaborative capabilities.  Advantages are that just-in-time  learning is possible, and courses can be tailored to specific needs and  asynchronous. E-learning may also be used to support distance learning  through the use of wide area networks. Often, but not always, e-learning  will also attempt to be a student-centered learning solution. 	Email.  A method of composing, sending, and receiving messages over  electronic communication systems. 	Instant Messaging.  Text communication between two or more people  through a network such as the Internet.  Instant messaging differs from  e-mail in that conversations happen in real-time. 	Search/Discovery.  Allows one to ask for media content meeting specific  criteria (typically those containing a given word or phrase) and retrieves  a list of files that match those criteria.  More advanced search engines  use bots (e.g., spiders, web crawlers, etc.) to index content to focus and  narrow searches. 	Shared Network Folders.  Repositories of information shared within a  local or wide area network. 	Tele (Audio) Conferencing.  The live exchange of information among  persons and machines remote from one another but linked by a  telecommunications system. 	Threaded Discussion Groups.  Discussion groups differ from chat rooms  and instant messaging because they usually deal with a single topic and  personal exchanges are typically discouraged.  Discussion groups are often  archived and organized by thread, which means all the messages that reply  to a starting message can be read in some order. Discussion group archives  are sometimes the best way to find an answer to very obscure questions. 	Video Conferencing.  Video communication involving audio and often text.  At its simplest, it provides transmission of static images and text  between two locations. At its most sophisticated, it provides transmission  of full-motion video images and high-quality audio between multiple  locations. 	Web Meetings and Broadcasts.   A focused, and typically moderated, forum  which combines instant messaging, application and document sharing  capabilities for groups to collaborate on a specific topic or agenda. Web  meetings and broadcasts typically can be archived. 	Weblogs (Blogs).  An online diary or journal application which contains  periodic, reverse chronologically-ordered posts on a common webpage,  typically accessible to any Internet user.  Formats vary from simple  bullet lists of hyperlinks, to article summaries with user-provided  comments and ratings.  Most blogs are run through a content management  system and have a way of archiving and generating a static address for  individual entries. 	Wiki.  Software that integrates work on a single project by several  concurrent users at separated workstations.  A group of Web pages that  allows users to add content, as on an Internet forum, but also permits  others (often completely unrestricted) to edit the content. The term wiki  also refers to the collaborative software (wiki engine) used to create  such a website. 2.6	The AFCOEKM Philosophy.  Plant knowledge engines/capabilities, nurture  collaboration, and tend when ripe.  Make collaboration available at  minimal cost to recruit champions (i.e., anyone with .mil access can  create or participate in an AFKN Community of Practice (CoP)); provide  support to sprouting communities (i.e., provide help desk services and  technical assistance); and engage organizations ready to transition to a  more strategic approach (e.g., via consultations and workshops) to  facilitate organizational change and continuous improvement. AFCOEKM uses a CoP methodology to implement KM principles.  A CoP is a  shared space where a group (possibly widely dispersed) of people who have  committed to working together build a collective knowledge base around a  common vital interest.  The defining characteristic of a CoP is it is a  working level capability.  The key to transforming the Air Force to a  knowledge sharing culture is ensuring people at the lowest levels  contribute their personal practices, experiences and expertise and share  this intellectual capital to accomplish the mission.  CoPs are designed  specifically for this purpose. A new AFKN CoP can be established by anyone  in minutes and is technologically simplenot intimidating.   As sharing  expands, new and additional collaboration capabilities or knowledge  engines can be introduced to members in the already-accepted CoP  environment. 3.0	INSTRUCTIONS:  CAPABILITY  STATEMENT REQUIREMENTS An interested party must be able to demonstrate, in any capability  statements submitted, extensive experience with and ability to perform the  kind of work described in this notice.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. MARKET SURVEY  SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS:   PURPOSE:  The Government is studying the attachment and performance of Flash Suppressors on heavy machineguns.  Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane is seeking to conduct a Product Improvement Project (PIP), seeking improved flash suppression for .50 Caliber M2 HB Machine Guns.  This effort is named Flash Suppressor  Heavy Barrel (FS-HB) until such time as the Government may assign formal nomenclature.   BACKROUND:  The USSOCOM Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) program provides small arms accessories to Army, Navy, and Air Force Special Forces Operators.  In 1993, USSOCOM arranged with the Naval Sea Systems Command to establish the SOPMOD Program Management Office at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Crane Division, at Crane, Indiana.  Since then, the SOPMOD Program has provided joint Special Operations Forces (SOF) with standardized, versatile weapons accessories to meet all needs across SOF mission scenarios.  These accessories increase SOF survivability and lethality by providing enhanced weapon performance, signature suppression, target acquisition, and day and night precision aiming.  The SOPMOD program provides these accessories to SOF operators when the accessories are developed to the point that they are operationally suitable, affordable, sustainable, and funded.  SOPMOD is an evolutionary acquisition program that continues to change and to up!  grade its subsystems with new combat technologies.  The FS-HB effort is undertaken to find a commercial item that exhibits marked improvement in performance over the current baseline .50 Caliber flash suppressor (Flash Suppressor, LSN: 1005-LL-LU0-3700).  REQUIREMENTS:  Platform modifications of this limited scope do not require a formal requirements document.  The fundamental platform modification requirement is to decrease the visible flash signature of M2 HB .50 Caliber Machineguns, thus increasing the existing capability of the Operator to survive and win close-range gunfights, particularly at night. INFORMATION REQUESTED:    a.  Performance:  The performance information required is to support a Government effort to explore industry capability to supply Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) flash suppressors for the M2 HB .50 Caliber Machinegun.  This Government is interested in extended life, expanded application, high-endurance machine gun flash suppression solutions that demonstrate enhanced flash suppression capabilities when compared to the baseline Flash Suppressor, LSN: 1005-LL-LU0-3700.  Ultimately, the goal of FS-HB is to correct any current operational performance shortfalls of the baseline Flash Suppressor, LSN: 1005-LL-LU0-3700.  The Government seeks COTS items or Non-Developmental Items (NDI) that eliminate or reduce visual cues, with a product life of 50,000 rounds under various firing schedules.  The FS-HB should fit the M2 HB barrel without the use of special tools or permanent modifications to the weapon or its parts, to include the barrel.  The Government will have limited to no inter!  est in products that adversely affect the reliability, maintainability, or basic functional performance of the host M2 HB.  Please submit a technical description of the product, such as physical characteristics, operational features, performance data, photographs, and physical characteristics.  This submission may be in the form of commercial product literature, operating instructions, and/or supplemental technical documentation that define the item and associated hardware. Request that potential sources address Fit, Function, Flash Suppression, SOF Environment (Rough Handling, cold etc), Accuracy, and Interoperability.  Potential sources should also provide any test results on the item, and should certify that the product is safe for use for its intended purpose.  The product should be able to safely use all existing .50 caliber ammunition, to include SLAP (M903).  If any remaining developmental or production issues exist, sources should relate their organization's experie!  nce, understanding, and plan for resolving the issues. b.  Schedule/Cost:  The SOPMOD Program is considering the establishment of a 5-year production contract for the FS-HB.  Each FS-HB information package provided by vendors should be cost-estimated in a configuration that includes a container, such as a sealed plastic bag or small, sealed box.  Each container will have a simple set of mounting / operating instructions, either as a folded sheet inside the container, or on the outside label.  Please fill out and return the price and delivery table (attachment 1) located at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/synopcom.htm for each variety of FS-HB product described.  Pricing information provided in response to this announcement will be handled by the Government as proprietary information and used by the Government for planning and budgetary purposes only.  Providers will not be bound at any time to the information provided. PRICING NOTES:  The SOPMOD Program seeks a low-cost solution for this FS-HB, and has an initial production price goal of less than $150 (Objective).  This price expectation may be adjusted after analysis of responses to this Market Survey.  The SOPMOD Program will have limited to no interest in any item having a production cost in excess of $499.00 (Threshold).  This is because under current policy, end items costing $500.00 or more require centralized serial number registry control and UID codes, greatly increasing the logistics burden and life cycle cost of the item.   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP):  Currently, the Government has no interest in the acquisition of vendor intellectual property.  Should this project result in a formal solicitation, the Government will clearly define its IP interests in the solicitation. The Government wishes to maintain open system architectures, and will have very limited interest in items that restrict future spiral development by using proprietary interfaces.  The SOPMOD Program does not have a drawing for the M2 .50 Caliber barrel/muzzle interface surface.  The SOPMOD Program will have limited to no interest in any item requiring permanent modification of the Heavy Barrel.   PARTICIPATION:  This announcement is a public invitation.  Failure to participate in this Market Survey will not preclude abstaining vendors from offering on possible future solicitations for the FS-HB.  However, this announcement is part of the full-free-and-open competition process, which encourages industry and academia to help shape Government specifications to match what is possible, affordable, and timely.  Failure to participate in this open dialog process may result in a Government performance specification over which the abstaining vendors have limited influence in the acquisition process, and may deprive abstaining vendors of potentially valuable direct early interaction with end-users, contracting officials, and acquisition planners.  TECHNICAL AND SCHEDULE RISK:  Small purchases of the FS-HB could occur as soon a February, 2007, when results of this Market Survey are received and analyzed.  The SOPMOD Program will have limited to no interest in basic research or initial applied research responses, or in early prototypical items, unless a clear, rapid path can be shown to achieve rapid delivery in a time frame relevant to current conflicts.  This schedule objective may be adjusted earlier or later depending on the schedule data collected from responding vendors.  COMMENTS:  The technical Point of Contact (POC) for this Market Survey is Mr. Scott Ross, telephone (812) 854-5849, e-mail to: scott.ross@navy.mil .  His mailing address is: NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane, ATTN: Mr. Scott Ross, Code 4081 Bldg 2521, 300 Highway 361, Crane IN 47522-5001.  It should be noted that during the evaluation of all information submitted, the Government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) and Wexford Group International (WGI), EG&G, and possibly other direct Government contractors as advisors to the Government evaluators.  While the Government may use Market Survey information provided to conduct small purchases for testing, combat user assessments, and specification/solicitation preparation, this sources sought synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issu!  e a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) is conducting market research, FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, to identify any Small Businesses (SBs), Non 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs), SBA 8(a) Program Businesses, Hubzone Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) and/or Women Owned Small Businesses (WOSBs) that possess the necessary technical capabilities to provide technical support as described in the draft Statement of Work for the EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs/Environmental Fate and Effects Division. Detailed information on the requirement is provided via a draft copy of the Statement of Work (SOW) which is posted to the following web-page on: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/0710252/index.htm                                        The Environmental Fate and Effects Division (EFED) of the Office of Pesticides Programs (OPP) is required under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA), to perform risk assessments of pesticides for both ecological and human health.  As such, OPP has established a risk assessment process which incorporate modeling as a means of estimating exposures in surface water and groundwater.  Currently OPP relies on a number of models to generate estimated exposure concentrations (EECs) in both drinking and ambient surface water. EPA is using the paired Pesticide Root Zone Model (PRZM) and Exposure Analysis Modeling System (EXAMS) to estimate a distribution of daily surface water concentrations that could be used for multiple chemicals over several years of predictions across the country.  PRZM-EXAMS has the capability of predicting water concentrations over a number of years based on collected historical weather data for the sites which are being modeled.  EPA relies on this model to provide EECs for use in the ecological risk and drinking water assessment. Pesticides environmental fate properties used in the modeling come from registrant-submitted data used for pesticide registration or reregistration.  The values used for spoil properties and site characteristics are chosen from databases appropriate for the sites of which the pesticide may be used.  Finally, the weather inputs for the model are taken from regional specific weather data, based on the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Major Land Resource Areas.  PRZM modeling is generally simulated for 30 years in order to calculate a return frequency of concentration in surface water body. The objectives of this potential contract are to: 	-	Develop scenarios using the guidance provided including the PRZM Guidance for Selecting Field Crop and Orchard Scenario Development Input Parameters, the Input Parameter Guidance and the example input scenario file to develop a single scenario for each identified crop/geography combinations.  	-	Develop additional scenarios as needed. 		-	Prepare scenario documentation using PRZM Guidance for Selecting Field Crop and Orchard Scenario Development Input Parameters, the Input Parameter Guidance and the example Metadata file. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620 with a size standard of $6.0 million for potential socioeconomic program businesses.  The current contractual vehicle for this requirement is a GSA Schedule Order number EP06H000149 under Syracuse Research Corporation?s GSA Schedule number GS-00F-0019L with a miximum value of $222,467.00. The potential contract will be a Fixed Rate Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) type with a 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods with a maximum estimated cost of approximately $690,000.00.   Any interested small business concerns are advised of the language in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section I Clause 52.219-14 "Limitations on Subcontracting" paragraph (b)(1) which states that under a small business set-aside contract for services "at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern." *****Therefore, the Capabilities Statement should realistically demonstrate how the small business concern would be able to comply with this clause which would be included in any potential contract.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) - Responses to this RFI are due no later than Jan 12, 2006 at 2:00 pm EST.

STATEMENT OF NEED


The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a continuing need to train its field and headquarters operational personnel in biotechnology/pharmaceutical topics. The Food and Drug Administration's Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) trains field and headquarters investigators and analysts to conduct inspections of biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical manufacturing processes and practices for compliance with GMP/GLP regulations through its Division of Human Resource Development (DHRD).  We seek the opportunity to expose course participants to product development; pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical facility and equipment design; technology transfer; product manufacturing processing; products; and analytical testing methods.  

FDA's ORA field employees are dispersed over a large geographic area.  Therefore the interest, at this time, is to offer training in the pharmaceutical area via distance learning - ORA employees have access to web based training from their desktop. 

DHRD is interested in working with an educational institution with pilot scale cGMP biopharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities to provide training to ORA employees.  Additionally, DHRD is interested in the institution having the capability to easily adjust to rapid changes in the technology in the pharmaceutical manufacturing processes.  The capability would allow training in quality systems for ORA field employees to prepare them to inspect the pharmaceutical firms that FDA regulates employing knowledge of the state of the art technology.  DHRD is also interested in an education institution that does not produce for profit pharmaceutical products as that would create a conflict of interest.

DHRD is also interested in the possibility of expanding the opportunities for training from an educational institution to include other product areas that FDA regulates, e.g. food, biologics, medical devices.

Pharmaceutical topics we are interested in include, but are not limited to:

Background in FDA-mandated regulatory issues governing the pharmaceutical industries

1. Manufacturing systems, processes and controls, for example:

This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the RFI.  This notice is not to be construed as an acquisition Request For Proposal (RFP), nor is any commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract implied, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI.  Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.

The mission of AF/A9 involves the assessment of current and future warfighting concepts and systems under a wide range of circumstances to support current operations and the development of plans?both for force structure and budgeting.  AF/A9 requires robust information technology (IT) services to support its missions.  The software used by AF/A9 is significantly more sophisticated than typical office automation including: specialized operations research constructive simulation models, mathematical optimization, value focused thinking, and other tools associated with operations research.  The computational heart of the organization is spread across fourteen vaults with specialized analytic architectures that combine UNIX (Solaris, IRIX, and/or LINUX) with Windows in stand alone networks.  These architectures are selectively combined and modified in five vaults to run on the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network with AF Enterprise office automation applications.  The architecture is further abstracted into another subset that runs on the Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network throughout these vaults.  The remaining nine vaults have highly specialized and adapted networks to support mission specific requirements.

AF/A9 uses proprietary data and trade secrets from industry that are competition sensitive.  All contractors in AF/A9 are subject to individual non-disclosure statements and corporate non-competition clauses to enable the combined arms assessments necessary to inform senior Air Force leadership decisions.

Each AF/A9 network has a separate accreditation package, subject to certification by a designated approval authority.  The equipment inventory consists of approximately 1,800 line items.  The various operating systems are integrated via middleware to allow shared printing and file services.  Each network within AF/A9 has several terabytes of storage configured in several ways, most with tape backup.  AF/A9 is responsible for the installation, configuration, patches, log monitoring, and system upgrades on 133 servers, approximately 650 desktop Windows workstations, and 150 Windows laptops distributed across twelve networks.  Altiris is used to manage the clone images and individual machine configurations.  AF/A9 works with the 844th CG per established local procedures, for the AF/A9 communications and audio visual support:  telephone, video teleconference, commercial COMSEC devices, projectors, and sound systems.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE issued by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Office of Acquisition and Assistance on behalf of the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, Office of Microenterprise Development (USAID/EGAT/MD) to determine the availability of potential sources to manage the Knowledge Management, Communications and Training (KMCT) Program. This sources sought notice is soliciting capability statements from Small Businesses 8(a), firms that have the capacity to implement the KMCT program.

I. BACKGROUND
In 2002, USAID awarded Accelerated Microenterprise Advancement Project (AMAP), which has been a series of Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQC). The project has been designed to provide USAID Washington and Mission-based operating units with services required to establish, deepen and/or expand their activities in microenterprise development. The AMAP initiative was designed knowing that the success of many development initiatives in part rests on effective collaboration, communication, and sharing of knowledge and experience. 

Two task orders were awarded under AMAP?s Support Services Contract to separately to manage AMAP related knowledge, as well as to provide office general assistance in training and administrative support. These task orders have supported a number of dynamic learning tools to reach out to our worldwide community of practitioners and provided opportunities to share the latest thinking and research in microenterprise development. For example, the microLINKS.org website hosts a number of innovative, interactive learning tools and thousands of resources to serve a global community of practitioners by helping to link knowledge with practice. Discussion forums, e-conferences, communities of practice and easy access to specialists for problem solving are just some of the resources provided through www.microlinks.org. Further, hundreds of USAID officers and microenterprise development practitioners have benefited from MD sponsored training. 

II. PURPOSE
The purpose of the KMCT activity is to strengthen microenterprise development practice through capturing, sharing and generating microenterprise development knowledge.

This includes any ideas that address the TDL needs to include, but not limited to, the following four areas: (1) Innovative approaches for reducing or eliminating the configuration of TDL terminals (i.e., “network design”) before mission deployment; (2) Innovative approaches to allow end users to configure TDL terminals in the field in real time or near real time; (3) Techniques for dynamic reconfiguration of network architecture to support multiple tactical nets. and (4) Methods to allow terminals in a TDL network to reconfigure themselves in response to a changing operational environment. Approaches that require only software modifications to TDL terminals are much cheaper to implement than those that require hardware modifications, and are therefore preferred, though ideas of any type are needed.  The agency is most interested in approaches that require no more than 3-5 years for development and deployment. This request is not funded and it is not a solicitation.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN07-12 - Request for Information - Assurable Global Networking
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - Assurable Global Networking

Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO), is requesting information on research ideas and approaches that could provide the foundation for next-generation Assurable Global Networks (AGNs). The requested information is sought to determine whether or not recent "clean-slate" thinking about the Internet has generated concrete ideas that warrant specific project-oriented investment by DARPA. No funding has currently been allocated to this effort, which is viewed as long-term fundamental networking research. A Broad Agency Announcement and/or other solicitation may or may not result from the findings of this RFI.

The DoD's Global Information Grid (GIG) includes a global network currently based on Internet technology. Considering the objectives of GIG architects provides some guidance as to the desired nature of an AGN. In the same way that it is unthinkable that commercial networks of the future could be as fragile and vulnerable as those of today, the future GIG must be assurable first and foremost. It is increasingly clear that current Internet technology is an inadequate foundation for an "assurable" network, if "information assurance" comprises concerns such as confidentiality, availability, integrity, and safety, which in turn depend on authentication and accountability.

Root causes of vulnerability in today's networks arguably lie in the prioritized list of ARPANET design principles documented in Table 1 [based on D. Clark, "The Design Philosophy of the DARPA Internet Protocols". Proc SIGCOMM, Sept 1988]. As outlined in Table 1, the topmost concern was basic inter-connectivity and the least concern was accountability; this list of priorities resulted in an Internet with corresponding strengths and weaknesses. It is likely that quite a different design would have emerged if assurability had been the topmost priority, and if the full range of modern threats (insider threat, lifecycle threats, inconsistent configuration management, pervasive software flaws, human error, social engineering, node capture, etc.) had been anticipated.

The prioritized list of design principles is interesting not only in its implications for information assurance, but also in terms of requirements that are not explicitly addressed. For instance, Internet designers clearly recognized the need to accommodate multiple networks and distributed management as driving design criteria. However, it has become clear that in practice network resources and access are also often partitioned as "Communities of Interest" (COIs) that do not necessarily correspond to geography or administrative domains. COIs are collaborative groups of users that must exchange information in pursuit of shared goals, interests, missions, or business processes. COIs often have special privacy concerns, multi-level security challenges, complex trust relationships, and ever-evolving coalition relationships. The best way to support such communities of interest is an open problem that may lead to radically different network designs, especially when information assurance is a topmost concern.

A second unmentioned requirement concerns support for mobility. Present-day Internet infrastructure is largely static, yet mobility is intrinsic to modern society and to the mission of the DoD. From the AGN perspective it is important to note that not just endpoints but also the infrastructure are expected to be mobile. Therefore, mobility at multiple levels must be intrinsic to future network designs, and topology construction may well occur as the result of forces that differ notably from the underlying economic market of the Internet.

Finally, the original design criteria concerning support for heterogeneous subnets (original priority #4) is worth re-emphasizing in the context of an Assurable Global Network. Protocol designers must consider the complexities that arise when trying to support users at the "tactical edge". End-to-end communication over wireless links and subnets must be intrinsically and securely supported by future network architectures or the goal of ubiquitous connectivity and computing will not be realized.


DARPA Internet design principles (in priority order)	Information Assurance Implications
The Internet must support multiplexed utilization of existing interconnected networks.	Interconnectivity and assurability are inherently at odds and must be balanced deliberately, but this topmost priority does not explicitly consider the tradeoff. Moreover, because legacy networks must be incorporated into the design, the required security mechanisms are driven by the limitations of the least capable legacy network.
Internet communication must continue despite loss of networks or gateways.	To speak of lost gateways and networks oversimplifies the nature of modern threats. Robustness must be redefined in terms of cyberattack as well as external physical attack or failure. Signals intelligence, infiltration, exfiltration, and malicious control are as important to consider as outright infrastructure loss.
The Internet must support multiple types of communications service.	Support for deploying multiple types of service without central administration is a key factor in the success of the Internet. Having said that, it may be that mission-specific assurable networks are not an appropriate arena for experimentation and innovation. It remains to be seen how a network architecture can support both innovation and security.

On another note, the Internet implementation of this criterion arguably promoted lack of separation between user applications and network services, thus needlessly exposing essential services to easy attack by users. Separation of control and data may be essential to network assurability.
The Internet architecture must accommodate a variety of networks.	Cross-domain security solutions are particularly difficult to design.
The Internet architecture must permit distributed management of its resources.	Existing implementations of distributed management are largely based on assumptions of trust, leading to protocols such as BGP that allow single inept or malicious user or administrator to create widespread chaos. Protocol "bulkheads" do not exist to limit damage from errors or malicious users. Defensive systems are layered upon protocols at additional cost and complexity, instead of being jointly designed with those protocols. The combination of configuration complexity and human error is the largest source of vulnerability in many networks.
The Internet architecture must be cost effective.	To the extent that economic considerations may be a root cause of poor security, a criterion concerning the cost of network defense should perhaps have a higher priority. Having said that, cost and security can also be at odds. What is the architecture that properly balances security and economic concerns?
The Internet architecture must permit host attachment with a low level of effort.	An integrated design would ensure simplified and authenticated attachment, one desirable end-point of this program. It remains to be seen what minimum requirements must be imposed on end systems in order to deliver an AGN.
The resources used in the internet architecture must be accountable.	Authentication and accountability are central to the achievement of IA objectives comprising availability, integrity, confidentiality, and safety.
 
Table 1: Prioritized design criteria of the original DARPA Internet


What is the path forward? Promising network designs are emerging in response to new network use cases. For instance, the concept of mobile ad-hoc networking has recently stimulated thinking about highly challenged environments that must support COIs, coalitions and joint operations, intrinsic mobility, bandwidth constraints, heightened threat of eavesdropping, and a potential for node capture that underlines the impossibility of fully preventing node compromise. Thus MANETs represent an extremely challenging niche for information assurance and network design and represent a small-scale version of the objective AGN.

If the history of disruptive technology is any guide, an effective MANET design might therefore substantially influence future networks. After all, MANETs do and will have inherently self-configuring protocols that account for mobility and reduce the threat of vulnerabilities based on misconfiguration. Assurable MANETs will likely be based on protocols that have a "Byzantine Generals" perspective on trust in contrast to present-day protocols that assume well-intentioned interlocutors. Finally, MANETs that support multiple COIs despite bandwidth constraints will have revisited the ideas about separation of control and data that are partly responsible for the complexity of red/black interfaces in today's GIG designs.

Although MANETs represent one source of disruptive innovation for Internet design, a first-principles architectural rethinking has as at least as much promise and may yield results more rapidly than the diffusion of niche ideas. Therefore, to inform future work on Assurable Global Networks, DARPA/STO is soliciting position papers answering the following questions:

1.	What should be the prioritized list of design criteria for a future Assurable Global Network that ultimately supports the DoD GIG?
2.	What technology shortfall examples most clearly illustrate the need for a new architecture?
3.	What concepts from the current Internet would need to evolve or change in order to support the proposed reprioritization?
4.	What elements of the present-day Internet design can or should be retained in the future AGN?
5.	To what extent does traditional "layering" impede progress toward the AGN? What might be the most appropriate abstractions and separations of concern in a future Internet? Consider both vertical layering and horizontal end-to-end considerations. Of particular interest are layerings that explicitly account for the relationship between network management, virtual private networks, and network control traffic.
6.	There are many threats to information assurance other than network architecture, to include the inevitability of software bugs, the complexity of system configuration, the susceptibility of people to social engineering attacks, and the inevitability of human error. Are these orthogonal issues in information assurance or can network design help defend against these threats and if so how?
7.	Are the needs of the DoD so different from users of the present Internet that a separate network architecture is needed, or can one architecture serve both needs?
8.	What overall R&D roadmap (key milestones and general timeline) might lead to a deployable Assurable Global Network? Do not be unrealistically constrained by time, but consider rather what would be needed to achieve a fully featured result.
9.	What cornerstone high-payoff project or experiment should be executed in the short term to best create a foundation for a future AGN? Note: this is the most important question in the list. Ideally the answer follows logically from answers to the previous 8 questions.

The following DOL Wage rate determination will be incorporated as part of the resultant purchase order: It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.  All quotations must be received not later than 5 Jan 2007, 10:00 A.M.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-07-138 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) to procure from Illumia Inc, 9390 Towne Center Drive, Suite 200, San Diego, CA 92121.  WG-30-503: Infinium Human Hap 550 Whole-Genome Genotyping Kit.  Each Sentrix Human Hap550 Genotyping BeadChip can process one sample and genotype > 550,000 local.  Each package contains ninety-six BeadChips, along with reagents for amplifying, fragmenting, hybridizing, labeling and detecting twenty-four whole-genome genotyping samples. The reagents are required for performing a whole genome association study in a Native American population. Infinium arrays are compatible with the Illumina Beadstation already installed in the LNG laboratory. To the best of our knowledge no other manufacturer produces a genotyping array that is compatible with this hardware, which requires us to obtain arrays directly from Illumina.  The Illumina reagent chemistry is preferred because the chemistry is compatible with the TECAN liquid handling robot currently in use in the laboratory. Use of Illumina arrays allows the experiment to be performed by LNG. The absence of suitable hardware for both running the arrays and scanning them would require that the arrays be run at another facility which increases the actual cost per chip. The Illumina 550K Whole Genome chip hip represents highest SNP density currently available and utilizes a haplotype maximization approach to SNP selection. Other vendors use a random SNP utilization approach to SNP selection and although using a similar number of SNP assays is unable to capture an equivalent amount of genetic information to the Illumina 550K array. The offeror must include a completed copy of the following provisions: 1) FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors ? Commercial; 2) FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation ? Commercial Items.  As stated in FAR Clause 52.212-2 (a),  ?The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.?  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical Evaluation, Price, and Past Performance; 3) FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications ? Commercial Items;  4) FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statues or Executive Orders ? Commercial Items, Contract Terms and Conditions ? Commercial Items; and 5) FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders ? Commercial Items ? Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations however; all responses received within 15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition. The offeror must include in their quotation, the unit price, the list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun & Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size.    The clauses are available in full text at http://www.arnet.gov/far.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation,Request for Quotes number W81XWH-07-T-0013, for commercial products, prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcem ent constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in behalf of the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Center, Europe (USAMMCE) and othe r activities of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) with veterinary activities that have recurring requirements for pet food, intends to award a sole source contract with Hills Pet Nutrition, Inc, Topeka, Kansas for Hills Pet Fo od Science and Prescription Diet product lines. Most of these products are issued by USAMMCE to fulfill needs at veterinary clinics in Europe, Iraq and Afghanistan and other areas of the Middle East.  USAMMCE has requirements world wide.  Stateside activit ies are veterinary clinics.  Army Regulation 40-905 Veterinary Health Services confirms the Army Veterinary Services as the Executive Agent for DoD and the Director, DoD Veterinary Services Activity, has directed that Hills Pet Nutrition Science product as the standard diet for Military Working Dogs (MWD).  However, the Veterinary Service also uses and prefers the Prescription Diet.  Hill Pet Foods Prescription Diet products are only sold through Veterinarians and the Science Diet product line is sold through discriminating retail vendors.  Hill has no wholesaler for the entire Hills Pet Nutrition product line and no one company other than Hills Pet Food could provide the entire product line.  In addition, the DoD Veterinary Service has determined t hat all Military Working Dogs will be fed a standard commercial diet consisting of Science Diet Active Maintenance Formula, however, this is only one product of 153 products desired by the Army veterinarians.  Special diets other than the above diet may be  fed to individual Military Working Dogs (MWD) only if prescribed by the attending Army veterinarian on a case-by-case basis.  The DoD Veterinary Services has also indicated that the preferred pet food for the DoD Veterinary Clinics is Hill's Pet Foods Sci ence and Prescription Diet since they provide an entire line of nutritional products that cater to the routine as well as special needs for canines and felines.  Further, it is desirable to procure directly from Hills Pet Food since they also monitor the q uality control on their products and warranty their product.  This IDIQ contract will be used to provide a procurement instrument for use by USAMMCE and other activities of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, however, demand data provided in this synopsis only reflects requirements from USAMMCE.  The Government intends to issue an IDIQ contract for Science Diet and Prescription Diet food products to Hills Pet Foods, the only known authorized source for these products.  The contract shall co nsist of one Base Year and four One Year Option Periods.  CLIN 0001 BASE YEAR - 0001AA Canine Products & Feline Products; 0001AB Shipping Charges.  CLIN 0002 Option Year 1; CLIN 003 Option Year 2; CLIN 0003 Option Year 4 and CLIN 0005 Option Year 5, all co nsists of the same SUB-CLINS as in CLIN 0001.  All products are identified on Enclosure A which lists all products and also indicates annual estimated quantities of each product.  Annual estimated expenditures are approximately $200,000.00.  The list at En closure A shall be the basis for the quote on this solicitation.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFP FOR TWO FREE-PISTON STIRLING POWER CONVERTORS.	Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject Synopsis/RFP and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to 1) Extend the proposal due date, 2) Answer additional questions received before the Question Submittal Deadline, and 3) Revise the initial instructions of the subject solicitation.  1) The due date for receipt of offers is extended to 5:00 PM EST, Monday, January 15th, 2006.   2) The following questions, submitted before the Question Submittal Deadline, are being answered (selected questions are paraphrased): Q1: The solicitation states that "Prospective Offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer."  What is the procedure for notifying NASA GRC of our intent to submit? A1: An e-mail notification will meet this requirement.	Early notification is utilized by the Government to adequately plan Government resources.  Although notification is encouraged, it is not required for this procurement.  The following section modifies this requirement. Q2: Are the drawings referenced in the 'Drawings' Section of the 'Minimum Requirements' required with the proposal?   A2: No. The proposal should include a discussion of the drawings (i.e. the Offeror's ability and willingness to meet the requirement) but the drawings are not required with the proposal.  (Please note: Drawings that are submitted with the proposal will be counted as part of the established page limitations.)	 Q3: The referenced FAR provisions state that "the initial offer should contain the offer's best terms..." because the award is intended to be made without further discussion.  What part(s) of the proposal constitute the delivery contract and should include our offer terms?  A3: The reference to "terms" above relates to the terms in the offer or proposal (i.e. delivery timeline, quality, price, etc.).  Once a selection has been made, a contract will be created with contractual terms and conditions and incorporate the proposed terms. Q4: Is it possible to extend the proposal due date? A4: The proposal due date has been extended. 2) The initial solicitation instructions (posted December 7th, 2006) have been revised.   The following sentence SHALL BE DELETED IN ITS ENTIRETY:  Prospective Offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.  AND THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE SHALL BE INSERTED IN LIEU THEREOF: Prospective Offerors are encouraged to notify this office of their intent to submit an offer. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on [ENTER DATE]. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.
