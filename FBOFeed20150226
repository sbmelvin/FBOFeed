<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health, Division of Laboratory Sciences intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price maintenance agreement contract to Parker Hannifin Company, 242 Neck Road, Haverhill, MA 01835. This contract will be for a base year of 12 months with 4 option years of 12 months each.
<p><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The Division of Laboratory Sciences uses the Parker Hannifin Company scientific equipment (Domnick Hunter hydrogen generators) instruments in CDC laboratories to quantitate Trans Fatty Acids. A service contract is necessary to keep the hydrogen generators in prime operating condition. In order to ensure critical deadlines are met, it is crucial that these instruments are functional and able to run 95% of the time. The Protein Biomarker Laboratory must obtain a service contract which covers annual maintenance service, as well as needed repair services for these instruments. As initial warranties expire for purchased instruments, they need to be covered by a maintenance agreement, which provides preventive maintenance and required services to ensure that the instruments are maintained in optimal operating condition and are available to perform required analyses.</p>
<p>Parker Hannifin Company is the sole manufacturer of the Domnick Hunter hydrogen generators and the only company that is capable of offering trained and certified technical and scientific staff with field service engineers trained on the Parker Hannifin equipment. Additionally, Parker Hannifin Company has experience in troubleshooting, repairing, and completing preventive maintenance practices for the Parker Hannifin equipment. As the sole developer of the Parker Hannifin Company Domnick Hunter hydrogen generators, Parker Hannifin has the ability to assist the CDC with any function in Domnick Hunter hydrogen generators, including maintenance, necessary upgrades and updates, and method applications and development.</p>
<p>The equipment to be covered in the contract is included as an attachment to this notice.</p>
<p>No solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps. We will only issue a solicitation to Parker Hannifin Company. Parker Hannifin Company is the only source available to provide this service that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurement is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Ms. Tessa Buffington via email to vsr3@cdc.gov using solicitation number 2015-N-16891 in the subject line, no later than 6:00pm Eastern Time, March 13, 2015.</p>

<DESC>Posting (brief abstract): 

This Market Survey is issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS)  Section 3.2.1.2.1.

1.	Introduction/Purpose

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is soliciting interest from industry participants capable of designing and building NavAids Monitoring Equipment (NME). The FAAâs Air Traffic Organization (ATO) mission is to provide safe, secure and efficient air traffic services to commercial, private and military customers operating in the National Airspace System (NAS).  The NavAids Monitoring Equipment system with an integrated interface will provide consolidated monitoring and control of navigational aid equipment by replacing multiple independent control and monitoring units located in air traffic control towers.  Background information and high level draft requirements for the NME system are provided in            Attachment 1 titled Market Survey Submission Requirements and Instructions. 

2.	Nature of Competition

This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  This market survey capability announcement is not a competition, but request for pertinent information to assist in the pre-acquisition stage. The acquisition strategy for this procurement has not been determined at this time; however, either an unrestricted competition or a set-aside may be chosen depending on the responses to the market survey. Interested large and small businesses are encouraged to respond to this market survey. 

Accordingly, this Market Survey must not be construed as either a promise to award a contract or an obligation for the Government to provide compensation for information associated with the preparation and submittal of inquiries addressing this Market Survey. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the FAA. The FAA reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey. Responses will not be returned.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of this survey or results of information submitted.

No solicitation exists.  Therefore, a schedule of the NME acquisition milestones such as draft Screening Information Request (SIR) release dates, proposal receipt dates, and anticipated contract award dates has not been determined. Also, the total estimated contract value for this effort has not been determined. If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the FAAâs Contract Opportunities (FAACO) web page.  It is the potential vendorâs responsibility to monitor the FAACO site for the release of any solicitation documents.

<SUBJECT>Direct User Access Terminal Service (DUATS)- Intent to Single Source
<SOLNBR>19866
<RESPDATE>030915
<ARCHDATE>03092015
<CONTACT>Troy Dorsey, troy.dorsey@faa.gov, Phone: 202-267-9889

<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform the industry of the basis of the FAAâs decision to contract using single source procedures.

I. INTRODUCTION/STATEMENT OF INTENT

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award up to a two (2) month single source contract extensions to each of the incumbent DUATS contracts. The period of performance of each single source contract extensions will be from March 17, 2015 up to May 16, 2015.

DUATS is currently provided by two service providers â Computer Science Corporation (CSC) and Data Transformation Corporation (DTC) via contracts DTFAWA-08-C-00119 and DTFAWA-08-C-00121. The contracts are Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Quantity contracts which were awarded in September 2008.   Both contracts expire on March 16, 2015, with no additional option periods available.

II. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES

DUATS is an internet-based service that provides GA pilots with preflight services via self-briefings and flight plan filing without the aid of a Flight Service (FS) Specialist.  
  
DUATS technical support is available via telephone to resolve access issues; however, no Air Traffic operational expertise is offered.  National Airspace System (NAS) connectivity is provided via the National Airspace Data Interchange Network (NADIN)-II, which interfaces with the Weather Message Switching Center Replacement (WMSCR) system for weather advisories and with air traffic operations for filing flight plans.  DUATS provides aviation weather in both textual (alphanumeric) and graphical formats.  After obtaining an online briefing, pilots can then use DUATS to file, amend, and cancel domestic Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight plans.  

III. REASON FOR SINGLE SOURCE EXTENSIONS

The FAA is currently conducting a limited competition for Direct User Access Terminal Service II (DUATS II) between the three incumbent service providers (Computer Science Corporation (CSC), Data Transformation Corporation (DTC), and Lockheed Martin) with operational internet-based automated pre-flight flight service systems that can meet the DUATS II requirements and are compliant with FAA Security requirements. 

Both current DUATS contracts (DTFAWA-08-C-00119 and DTFAWA-08-C-00121) expire on March 16, 2015, with no additional option periods available. The FAA requires up to a two (2) month single source extension to both of the current DUATS contracts to allow for completion of proposal evaluation and contract award of the limited competitive follow-on contract(s). 

As the FAA is currently in the process of completing a limited competitive acquisition for the follow-on DUATS contract(s), a competition for the extension period is not feasible. Therefore, a single source extension to each of the current DUATS contracts for up to two (2) months is in the best interest of the FAA.

IV. QUESTIONS

This announcement is for informational purposes only, not a Solicitation/Request for Proposal.  Any questions regarding this announcement must be directed, in writing, to Troy Dorsey, Contract Specialist, via email at troy.dorsey@faa.gov by 2:00 PM EST, March 6, 2015.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>This is a pre-solicitation / non-competitive (notice of intent) synopsis to award a purchase order without providing for full and open competition. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Elsevier B.V., RADARWEG 29 AMSTERDAM, NOORD-HOLLAND, 1043 NX NETHERLANDS to provide institution wide access to QUOSA Information Manager: Platinum Version and QUOSA Virtual Library: Institutional Repository Edition to the NHLBI Information Technology and Assessment Center (ITAC).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The NHLBI Information Technology and Assessment Center (ITAC) has provided a NHLBI-wide subscription to QUOSA Information Manager and QUOSA Virtual Library to NHLBI Intramural and Extramural staff (both scientific and support staff) for several consecutive years. This subscription renewal will enable staff to continue to use QUOSA and maintain their personal document collections.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The ITAC is requesting the purchase of a software subscription to QUOSA Information Manager and Virtual Library in order for the NHLBI scientists and support staff to retrieve and organize journal articles from on-line journals and scientific databases, such as PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and Ovid. QUOSA enables articles to be exported into bibliographic software programs named Endnote and Reference Manager, for which the NHLBI holds a site license. This simplifies the process of obtaining citations for manuscripts as well as allowing researchers to stay up-to-date on related research.</p>
<p>The QUOSA Virtual Library allows a group of employees to share articles and internal documents in a common space, a specialized document repository, currently hosted by QUOSA, Inc. Those in the group can share, archive, and deliver documents to group members.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide institution wide access to QUOSA Information Manager: Platinum Version and QUOSA Virtual Library: Institutional Repository Edition.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>NHLBI Intramural and Extramural staff, both scientific and support staff, use QUOSA to search for scientific articles pertinent to NHLBI research to keep up-to-date on related research topics. The renewal of the subscription for these licenses will allow staff to continue to keep their personal document collections as well as those collected in QUOSA Virtual Libraries. The subscription renewal incudes product updates, upgrades, support, as well as, maintenance of Virtual Libraries.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that QUOSA can only be obtained directly from Elsevier (the manufacturer) and there are no authorized resellers for this software subscription.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source (for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold) and only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 519130, Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals, and the Small Business Size Standard is 500.

The resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-78 (December 26, 2014).</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.

<p>All responses must be received by March 5, 2015 at 11:00 a.m., EST and must reference synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HL)-2015-077-RMD. Responses shall be submitted to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Room 6144, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Renee Dougherty.

 The Contractor shall indicate in their proposal and submit that organizationâs guidelines which will be followed for the retro-commissioning process.

The Contractor shall perform retro-commissioning services as detailed in the following.  Retro-commissioning applies a systematic investigation process for improving and optimizing a buildingâs operation and maintenance (O and M).  Retro-commissioning occurs anytime after construction, as an independent process.  It may or may not emphasize bringing the building back to its original intended design.  The core retro-commissioning process consists of four primary phases (and will be applied to each building identified for retro-commissioning):  1) Planning Phase which will include but not be limited to Initial Site Survey and Interview, Documentation Review (including existing in-house and contractor maintenance practices), Develop Utility Bill Benchmarking (utility data furnished by NAVFAC HI Energy Team), Identify any equipment deficiencies that may prevent the completion of the Investigation Phase, for instance if any equipment is inoperable preventing the completion of the testing and balancing of the HVAC system.
 Generate a listing of necessary repairs to continue RCx process and the cost should the Government elect to have the repairs done by the Contractor, Develop and Submit RCx Planning Report, Generate Project Issues Log and List of Potential Energy Conservation Opportunities (ECOs) â Planning Phase;  Participate and Facilitate a RCx Scoping Meeting; 2) Investigation Phase which includes but is not limited to Implementing Diagnostic Monitoring (Data Logging) Plan; Conducting Point to Point and Functional Testing, Executing Test and Balance Assessment Survey (electrical and water use, etc.); Comparing Current System Performance to Desired System Performance Criteria, Updating Project Issues Log and List of Potential ECOs, Retrieving and Analyzing Data Logging Data, Performing Energy Analysis of Potential ECOs, Developing Investigation Report; 3) Implementation Phase Support includes but is not limited to Implementation of repairs and improvements, Retesting and re-monitoring for results; Revising estimated energy savings calculations, Developing system performance report; 4) Project hand-off and integration phase includes but is not limited to preparation and submittal of retro commissioning final report and develop re-commissioning plan/schedule.

<DESC>A Market Survey was conducted by Sources Sought Announcement on 9 July 2014 posted on NECO/FedbizOpps seeking availability and capability of qualified and eligible businesses in the Small Business Programs.  As a result of the market research analysis, the Government is not confident that there are a minimum of two verified, capable, small business contractors in any socio-economic program available to perform the design and construction services for this project. On 8 January 2015, the Small Business Program Office concurred with the following unrestricted, full and open competition determination.

THIS IS AN UNRESTRICTED COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR SUBPART 6.1 FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.
 This procurement will use the two-phase design-build selection procedures and consists of one solicitation covering both phases. Source Selection procedures will be used with the intent to award a firm-fixed price construction contract to the responsible Offeror whose proposal, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the Government. 

The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for the Design and Construction of P-800 Steam Plant Decentralization at Naval Base San Diego (NBSD), San Diego, California. 

This project disconnects the existing centralized steam distribution system and provides for the construction of localized mechanical systems for approximately 45 buildings and ten piers at Naval Base San Diego (NBSD).
 Mechanical systems include high efficiency natural gas water boilers, radiant gas heaters and other similar heating systems and associated piping to accommodate building and pier mechanical load requirements. The project will also discontinue use of the centralized steam system. This includes the modification, demolition and abandon-in-place of existing steam distribution lines and heat exchangers that support building systems such as hot water heaters and heating and ventilation systems. Dedicated steam plants will be constructed to serve the piers.

The project includes renovation of all affected building spaces where the existing heating systems are renovated. Renovations include ceiling, wall, and roofing repairs, as well as furring to accommodate mechanical piping and electrical renovations.
 Mechanical utility work includes upgrading and expanding the natural gas laterals or valve box or vault for the underground natural gas piping system to provide the required gas service to the new gas-fired system retrofits and/or providing new gas lateral for building where there are no existing gas service. Gas service to each facility shall include service meters with pulse output capable of remote reading. Electrical utility work includes modification of existing underground electrical to accommodate the decentralized steam system retrofits. Demolish the existing aboveground steam distribution system and disconnect from the existing central cogeneration steam plant to accomplish full decentralization of the steam system.
 Demolish existing steam manholes and repair paving, parking aprons, and other surfaces where manholes are removed.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238220, and the annual size standard is $15 million. The estimated price range for design and construction is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000. 

The Government intends to evaluate proposals without discussions.

<DESC>The Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to acquire, through full and open competition, technical, analytical, engineering, and project/program management support for The Joint Staff J6 Command, Control, Communications and Computers/Cyber Directorate (C4/Cyber), and more specifically the Deputy Directorate for Cyber and Command, Control, Communications, and Computers Integration (DD C5I).  The mission of the Joint Staff J6 is to serve the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), develop C4/Cyber capability requirements and facilitate on behalf of the Joint Force in order to deliver a sustained information advantage, enable decision and action at the speed of the problem, and to ensure the warfighter receives jointly integrated and effective capabilities necessary to conduct operations.
 The Joint Staff J6 DDC5I provides engineering, assessment, training and analysis support in order to accomplish the mission responsibilities of the CJCS and the Joint Staff. In order to effectively accomplish integration responsibilities, Joint Staff J6 provides technical support to assessments and exercises to identify and resolve joint interoperability gaps, overlaps, and shortfalls that result in deficiencies in joint warfighting capabilities. The development of architectures, data and services, and standards are key enablers and criteria for assessment and integration.

The work objectives to be performed under this requirement include:

- Capability, Programs, and Systems Analysis
- Joint Command and Control (C2) Requirements Management
- Requirements and Architecture Development
- Architecture Information Sharing (to include Systems Integration  and  Web Development)
- Integration and Interoperability Support
- Data and Services Support
- Joint Fires Support
- Deployed Analysis in Operational Environments
- System Engineering Support
- Configuration and Data Management Support
- Information Technology (IT) Support
- C4 Cyber Support
- Technical Support

The support provided will utilize the operational experience of the Joint Staff and Military Services to influence and shape present and future C4 and Cyber capabilities.
  It will deliver the Joint Force a horizontally integrated portfolio of quality C4/Cyber systems and services that anticipate and satisfy their operational needs.

For planning purposes only, it is estimated that the requirement will call for 1,557,835 hours of effort over the life of the contracts.

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  However, interested parties may identify to the Contracting Officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governmentâs requirement with a commercial item.  Under this requirement, the Government intends to make multiple awards for the entire requirement.  The awarded contracts will be Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) â Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts with an ordering period beginning around 15 January 2016 and continuing through 14 January 2021.

The specific actions and/or tasks required will be identified on individual task orders issued under these contracts.

Travel will be required in support of this requirement.

<DESC>NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolk Philadelphia Office intends to procure, for the Navy International Program Office (NIPO) the continued development, maintenance, and management of the FMS Admin Case Tracking System (FACTS), the FMS Strategic Planning Database, and Operational Cost Execution Models, all of which are equally critical for and necessary to perform Activity Based Costing (ABC) activities, and FMS Administrative Budget Support functions that ensure validity of the data used by DoN and U.S. Coast Guard leadership in decision-making.  Support tasks include system administration, database, database administration, configuration management, network engineering support, as well as program and financial management support related to supporting the above mentioned systems, ensuring compliance with IA programs and objectives including continued Certification and Accreditation (C and A), support for the continued development, maintenance, updates and enhancements of the developed software for FACTS, the FMS Strategic Planning Database, and Operational Cost Execution Models.
  
It is anticipated that a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract will be issued as a result.
  The applicable NAICS and size standard are 541511 and $27.5M respectively.  This is a sole source action to be awarded to George Consulting LTD.  A recently completed Independent Verification  and  Validation (IV and V) test resulted in over 600 findings which need to be corrected by George Consulting.  These findings affect the FACTS Web server, Application Server and Database server, the FACTS Router, Remote Desktop Gateway (RDG) server, IA Suite server and HBSS server falling under the CSI IPT area of responsibility.  Based on contractor experience and work completed to date, only George Consulting, Ltd. has the experienced personnel required to address the IV and V findings and complete the FACTS migration effort.
  With the current FACTS System migration effort taking place and IV and V findings which need to be corrected, in addition to the Navyâs Security Assistance Program Budget Review Process (SAPBR) which the FACTS System will be supporting through FY 2015, a contract award to another contractor at this point in time would be disruptive and would jeopardize mission accomplishment.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The Small Business office has reviewed this market research and concurs with the acquisition strategy identified herein.

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.
  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based on the responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this notice.   Any responses to this synopsis should be sent to the attention of Mike Capilato (Code 260.2) at michael.capilato@navy.mil and reference this notice.

<DESC>Defense installations are required by law - in particular, by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005), and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA 2007) - to eliminate fossil fuel use in new and renovated facilities by 2030 and to reduce overall facility energy usage by 30% by 2015.  Army policy is to achieve five (5) Net Zero Energy (NZE) installations by 2020 and twenty-five (25) by 2030. Design of Net Zero Energy installations is a complex undertaking however, that requires an optimal mix of demand reduction, system integration on a community scale, use of renewable sources, and storage technologies.  Installation planners lack the ability to analyze and optimize performance of complex non-linear dynamically coupled systems needed to achieve NZE goals in a timely and cost-effective manner. <br>  <br> Prior work developed early versions of a Net Zero planning tool (Net Zero Planner) which assists installation planners to develop an optimized path towards a Net Zero Energy installation.  This tool needs further development and enhancement to incorporate additional capabilities.   <br>  <br> This is not a request for proposal and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. <br>  <br> The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511 which has a size standard of $27.50M. This is a small business set a-side.  <br>  <br> Major Requirements:  The Contractor shall provide necessary manpower and equipment to accomplish the following six tasks: <br> Task 1:  Implement full HVAC system coverage across all models. <br> Task 2:  Add four (4) new residential housing facility types. <br> Task 3:  Upgrade to most recent version of EnergyPlus. <br> Task 4:  Implement comprehensive ASHRAE 90.1-2004 modeling for calculating the EPAct baseline energy consumption. <br> Task 5:  Generate EISA baseline source energy use intensity (EUI) reference values for each facility type and climate zone. <br> Task 6:  Update documentation and User Guide for Params. <br>  <br> Period of Service: All work to be performed under this contract shall be completed not later than three hundred (300) days from contract award. <br>  <br> Estimate of when solicitation will be issued:  April 16, 2015 <br>  <br> Point of Contact (POC):  Wanda Huber, Wanda.L.Huber@usace.army.mil, (217) 373-6730. <br>  <br> Alternate POC:  Andrea Thomas, (217) 373-6746, Andrea.J.Thomas@usace.army.mil.

The contractor will be required to begin full performance 12 March 2015. <br> 	 <br> The Army desires industry innovative ideas that will mitigate these risks. Without mitigating theses risks, the Army must award an interim contract to the current incumbent contractor, AT&T Government Solutions. <br>  <br> Any contractor awarded will be required to provide workforce analysis support system, civilian forecasting system and competency management system support services for headquarters, Department of the Army Office of the Deputy of Chief of Staff, G1, Office of the Assistant G-1 for Civilian Personnel Plans, Analysis and Evaluation Divisions (AG-1)(CP)PAED) Fort Belvoir, VA.  <br>  <br> This requirement is only an interim solution. The long term requirement to provide workforce analysis support system, civilian forecasting system and competency management system support services at Fort Belvoir, VA will be solicited in the near future and will provide for competitive proposals. For maximum consideration, responses to this notice are requested in writing no later than 12:00 noon, Eastern Time, 2 March 2015.  <br>  <br> Send responses by e-mail to Kerry St. John at kerry.a.stjohn.civ@mail.mil .

<DESC>This Small Business Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business or HUBZone small businesses capable of Sequencing Service.
<p>Our high-throughput experiments present many leads that we must follow-up at a functional level. Traditional mutagenesis takes at least a postdoc year of effort per gene, but we have many hundreds of candidate genes to screen. Members of our team have identified several hundred genes that show sex-biased expressed just when germline sexual identity is established in the embryo. In vivo RNAi is an effective tool for determining the function of these genes specifically in the somatic gonad and germcells. This allows use to examine the function of genes that may have vital roles in the whole organism (and thus result in uninformative lethal phenotypes).</p>
<p>The requested project is supplemental to our project that was initiated with a previous another purchase order. Construct injections require expertise, facilities and reagents that are outside the scope of our lab. We must continue to collaborate with the vendor to avoid the introduction of new variables into our research and to avoid long delays and additional costs resulting from retesting products from other potential suppliers.</p>
<p>Services to be performed:<br /><br />Injection service<br />Mutation Service</p>
<p>All work shall be performed at the contractor's research facility during their prescribed working hours.<br />. <br />The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 813990 with a size standard of 500. Offerors who are capable of providing at a minimum, fifty-one percent (51%) of the required/actual services of this solicitation. All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business. Interested firms responding to this market survey must provide (a) capability statement demonstrating their experience, skills and capability to fulfill the Government's requirements for the above. The capability statement shall be in sufficient enough detail, but not to exceed 15 pages, so that the Government can determine the experience and capability of your firm to provide the requirements above. Your capability statement, not to exceed 15 pages, should include references. Capability statement must be received at the address identified in this synopsis no later than 11:00 A.M. local time at designated location) on March 9, 2015.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction<br /></strong>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under NAICS code 517911 should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><strong>Background<br /></strong>The Center for Scientific Review (CSR), at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has been using voice-over-IP (VOIP) audio-conferencing to facilitate CSR's scientific review meetings since 2006. VOIP technology has provided CSR with a stable technology for connecting with reviewers nationally and internationally, many times alleviating the need for travel. Voice-over-IP (VOIP) technology allows CSR to improve the traditional teleconferencing that was used in the past. VOIP provided CSR with a teleconferencing vehicle to reach out to an expanded audience of scientific reviewers who access the review meetings by dialing into a virtual conference room, regardless of their geographic location nationally or internationally.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose<br /></strong>CSR is the focal point, at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in support of the conduct of initial Peer Review, and the foundation of the NIH grant and award process. CSR carries out the majority of Peer Review of research and research training applications submitted to the NIH. In addition, CSR serves as the central receipt point for all such Public Health Service (PHS) applications; makes referrals to scientific review groups (SRGs) for scientific and technical merit review of applications; and, to funding components for potential award. To this end, CSR develops and implements innovative, flexible ways to conduct referral and review for all aspects of science.</p>
<p>CSR is seeking a qualified vendor to provide audio conferencing and web interface services to be used at meetings during its Peer Review rounds which are held throughout the year.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements<br /></strong>Specific project requirements are anticipated to be in accordance with the attached DRAFT Statement of Work.</p>

<DESC>This RFI is issued solely for information, planning purposes, and market research only; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The DEA is not at this time seeking proposals.  The purpose of this RFI is to seek industry information about existing commercially available real-time and non- real-time tracking systems. This RFI is not seeking information about commercially available real-time and non- real-time tracking systems which are in the developmental phase.

DEA consistently seeks to obtain information and comments from industry that will provide the agency with insight into market conditions and/or scientific advances that will aid in the refinements of requirements and the formation of an acquisition strategy for tracking technology systems.  This RFI is designed to conduct market research to determine the current level of technology and availability of such technology in the current market. DEA is interested in obtaining information related to existing, fully developed, and integrated commercially available tracking technology that effectively integrates Global Positioning System (GPS), wireless communication systems, and customized mapping and data distribution software. Small businesses are encouraged to respond to this RFI in order to assist DEA in determining the potential level of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability of the Small Business community to fulfill this requirement. However, responses to this RFI are solicited from all interested parties.

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has a requirement for a family of real-time and non-real-time tracking equipment to meet the operational requirements of the tracking program currently in operation throughout DEA.  The equipment shall be compatible with the current Centralized Tracking System (CTS) used to monitor and track all DEA assets and investigative targets.  

The tracker shall be self-contained and include all necessary components to install, collect and transmit, via wireless technology, GPS data (latitude, longitude, time, date, and velocity) to a remote tracking terminal station. The ability to remotely command and monitor tracker status shall exist. The tracker shall have as a minimum the following programmable features:  GPS sample rate (minimum 5 seconds), motion detection, scheduled and unscheduled callouts (phone, e-mail, pager), Geo-fence (entrance, and exit alarms) and power management (Sleep, Wake on motion, Full on).  

The actual tracking device power specifications shall be DC operated with the following power requirements:  power inputs shall be protected against polarity reversal, internal power regulation shall allow operation from a power source rated between 9VDC and l5VDC, maximum total device current during operation shall not exceed 100ma. During sleep mode the maximum current shall not exceed 10ma. 

The maximum physical size shall not exceed 4.7" x 2.8" x 1.75" to include connectors, magnets, mounts, and tie wrap loops and the maximum weight shall not exceed two pounds, excluding batteries.

The tracking devices shall have a built-in capacity to store at least 200,000 GPS records.  Non-volatile memory shall be used to prevent data lost during power outages or operating 
in non­coverage areas. While operating in non-coverage areas, GPS records shall be stored in onboard memory and automatically downloaded once the tracking device is within coverage. Devices that are designed as data loggers shall retain all GPS data records in memory until downloaded.  If  GPS tracking records are stored in a format other than industry standard NEMA, the contractor shall provide the necessary software conversion tools to allow the data to be exported to data analysis programs such as Microsoft Access and/or Excel.  As a minimum, tracking records shall include data fields that record the targets latitude, longitude, time, speed, and block street address. The mapping software as a minimum shall have the capability to perform data search and sorts on these fields.

All tracking devices shall have as a minimum, one (1) input control line that can read the status of a switch (open or closed), and one ( 1) output line that can be remotely commanded to switch a one ( 1) amp load. Switching inputs/outputs are not required on devices that are designed to be used as data loggers.

All tracking devices shall operate in the following environment with no degradation in operational performance:  operating temperature range of -20F to 140F, relative humidity of 5% to 95%, water resistance equivalent to that as sprayed from a garden hose for three (3) minutes, survive a one ( 1) meter drop onto a concrete surface as well as vibrational forces that are associated with the exterior surfaces of a moving vehicle.

All power cables, input/output cables, programming cables, antennas (GPS and Cellular), and documentation necessary to install the tracking device using either the vehicles power source or an external battery source should be provided with each tracking device.  Tracking devices shall operate using commercially available communication protocols and standards. Acceptable wireless communications protocols and standards include:  Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM). In addition to conducting real-time tracking in the US, the DEA is seeking solutions that will support its global tracking requirements.  Solutions that employ satellite based communication technologies are acceptable.   All cellular based tracking devices shall have an Internet Protocol (IP) capability in addition to a cellular or radio link point to point capability. The IP capability is required to ensure that tracking devices procured are capable of operating with the DEA Centralized Tracking System (CTS).  A Microsoft Windows compatible mapping software package that allows the tracking device(s) to transfer GPS tracking data and device status to a remote base control tracking terminal shall be prided.

<SUBJECT>Port Operations and Maintenance - non-competitive action to execute an out of scope modification - Commander, Navy Region Hawaii, Pearl Harbor
<SOLNBR>N6883613C0042
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:bruce.ayres@navy.mil">bruce.ayres@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Pearl Harbor (FLCPH) intends to execute an out of scope modification against contract N68836-13-C-0042 to increase the not to exceed amount of CLINs 1003-4003 and 1004-4004.  All reimbursable supplies and services are procured on an as needed basis in order to maintain the operability of CNRHâs vessels using CLINâs 1003-4003 and 1004-4004. The required supplies and services vary but are typical of commercial tools, equipment, and operating supplies when engaged in performing maintenance and repairs on vessels, trailers and equipment.   No other CLINs are used to procure such items and services. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, the contractor is required to procure and manage an adequate amount of consumables and spare parts to maintain operability of the CNRHâs vessels.
  The NTE amounts were established as static dollar values during the acquisition planning and solicitation phases of the contract.  Offerors were required to use the Government provided $1.5 million NTE amounts in their price proposals for the base and all option years of CLINs 0003 and 0004 and all corresponding option years.  The static CLINs had no impact on the price analysis and/or the resulting award.  The purpose of the increase is to better align the needs of the operation to the NTE values of the contract.  

On 27 August 2013, N68836-13-C-0042 was awarded as a firm-fixed price contract to provide maintenance, operations, and logistics services in support of Commander, Navy Region Hawaiiâs (CNRH) port operations at Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam (JBPHH).
  The contractor is required to maintain the appropriate number and types of vessels, while ensuring the vessels are properly configured to support the port.  The contractor is Metson Marine Services Inc., 2060 Knoll Drive, Suite 100, Ventura, California, 93003.  The contract was solicited and awarded as a small business set-aside under full and open competition procedures.  The Government intends to execute the modification consistent with the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), one source or limited sources, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Government will support the proposed actions by written justification and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceeding.
 The Government will post the approved justification to the GPE. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement; however, THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  All capability statements received by 12:00 pm Hawaiian Standard Time on March 10, 2015 will be reviewed by the Government and considered. However, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely to the discretion of the Government. Should your firm desire to submit a capability statement, it should demonstrate the Offerors experience and expertise to provide the services identified above within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government.
 The statement shall include business size; subcontracting requirements; and any other information indicating a legitimate ability to meet these specific requirements. Statements should not exceed 5 pages in length.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Civil Enforcement intends to extend contract EP-W-09-033 with Eastern Research Group, Inc. for three months past its current expiration date of 31 March 2015.  This extension is necessary because of a protest to the award of a new contract under Request for Proposal SOL-DC-13-00031. The services under EP-W-09-033 include the ongoing investigation of violations to the various environmental statues, and the litigation of civil and criminal cases.  These services are essential to the EPA mission and suspension of this contract would have a serious adverse effect on the discussed efforts. Therefore, until a new contract award can be made, it would be both impractical and harmful to the agency and the public interest for any source other than the current contractor to be considered for the provision of these services.  After the contract has been extended, a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition will b e posted to FedBizOpps.

This special notice to industry is to follow up on previous market research conducted under sources sought notice No. SAQMMA13SS0002 (at https://www.fbo.gov/spg/State/A-LM-AQM/A-LM-AQM/saqmma13ss0002/listing.html) which industry participated in and has requested information to share related to acquisition planning. This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP), or any type of solicitation for competition. This special notice is for industry to be informed on a determination made by the Government in conjunction with the Small Business Administration to place this upcoming opportunity under GSA 8(a) STARS II for competition among IDIQ GWAC holders, and GSA has determined this requirement to be compatible with the scope of the 8(a) STARS II for Constellation I under Functional Area (FA) 2 which will be referenced.

<p>All GSA 8(a) STARS II IDIQ holders under Constellation I under Functional area 2 will be requested within five (5) days of the GSA E-Buy Task Order RFQ posting to opt in - or opt out of the opportunity after they have a chance to review the requirements under the opportunity.</p>
<p>We anticipate a short period for questions and answers if needed, along with a multi-phased evaluation approach which will be defined in the task order RFQ synopsized under GSA E-Buy.</p>
<p>Any additional questions or concerns, please contact Vincent J. Sanchez at 703-875-6629, via email SanchezVJ@state.gov or Crystal Brooks at 703-875-6218 or via email at BrooksCC@state.gov.

<SUBJECT>Third party validation of energy storage technologies for stationary storage applications
<SOLNBR>15_432
<RESPDATE>040315
<CONTACT>Summer Ferreira, Email energystorage@sandia.gov
<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background Information:</span></strong>
<p>Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) with the support of DOE Office of Electricity funding has both an energy storage analysis laboratory (ESAL), equipped with over 100 testing channels capable of evaluating DC storage solutions up to 72 volts and 2000 amps, and an energy storage test pad, capable of grid tied evaluation of energy storage systems up to 1 MW in power and above.  For promising technologies capable of grid integration and other stationary applications, the DOE OE can provide support through both these resources and labor for carrying out third party evaluation of technologies.  Interested developers from the R&amp;D through commercially deployed stages (solutions with technology readiness level between 3 and 9) are encouraged to submit applications.  Applications are currently being accepted and will be evaluated for suitability to carry out validation at Sandia. Sandia is a multi-program laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the United States Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opportunity Description:</span></strong></p>
<p>Manufacturers, integrators and consumers of stationary energy storage are encouraged to apply for third party testing of storage solutions identified for stationary applications.  Selected technologies will be evaluated.  Sandia will determine the appropriate scale of the validation activity and test plan to be followed, and will carry out in-house evaluation and public reporting of the results from such testing.The industrial partner will be expected to provide batteries for testing. <br /><br />The industrial partner will be expected to provide batteries for testing and to participate in project discussions and data review efforts. <br /><br />Applications for analysis at the ESAL will be considered for DC technologies to run under the DOE "Protocol for Uniformly Measuring and Expressing the Performance of Energy Storage Systems" frequency regulation application, along with analysis of performance metrics.  This protocol is attached for reference.</p>
<p>The Energy Storage Test Pad has opportunities for grid connected energy storage systems to be analyzed for A: performance of grid support functions, and/or B: safety in the deployment environment. Test articles will be used to validate common test protocols and to develop advanced protocols for the performance and safety of energy storage systems. Battery systems may be required to provide representative cells and or modules for performance and safety analysis in the ESAL prior to system testing. Grid support functions include area regulation, frequency regulation, voltage support and many other automated and commanded operation modes. Performance of these functions will be analyzed using test procedures designed to derive salient metrics.  Test procedures will be mutually agreed upon by Sandia and the collaborating partner. Safety will be analyzed using Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA), which will help develop a systematic test program to validate the enforcement of safety constraints. When supplying a proposal for testing services, please provide all requested information from the application packet.<br />Information Sought:</p>
<p>A detailed description of the technology and proposed application is required.  This is to include the battery specifications and any abuse and performance testing that has been carried out either in-house or through another third party testing entity.  The attached application files must be used to apply for testing.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions to Responders: </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fast Track application:</span> The fast track application form is to be used for any testing that the applicant can provide justification for expedited processing and analysis. Additionally, the project must be of limited scope, with no greater than 12 weeks of testing expected. The device(s) must be available for immediate shipping. Attach additional page(s) if needed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Standard application:</span> The standard application may be used for any energy storage testing project proposed for evaluation at Sandia.  Applications will be considered on a semiannual basis.  The deadline for the next review period is April 3, 2015.</p>
<p>The application forms are available in .pdf and .docx.  Submissions and attachments should not exceed 5MB and only the following document types will be accepted (.doc, .docx, .pdf). Responses should be submitted electronically no later than 5:00 p.m. MDT on April 3, 2015 for standard applications. An email notification will be sent acknowledging successful receipt of the response.  Fast track applications can be submitted at any time.  Send completed application to Summer Ferreira at energystorage@sandia.gov.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evaluation Criteria:</span></strong></p>
<p>SNL is seeking the partner offering the most promising energy storage solutions for use cases needed in grid storage in the U.S., abroad in forward operating bases, as well as in storage markets outside of the U.S. which are anticipated to have applicability to domestic storage interests.</p>
<p>Firms should be capable of providing an estimated in-kind and/or funds-in contribution depending on the technical expertise of the industrial partner and size of the proposed project.</p>

It has a very limited market, and the expertise required to repair the units are unique to this company and product.<br /> In order to maintain emergency readiness within the NOAA OMAO Ronald Brown, it is necessary to procure the services. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is FAR 13.106-1(a)(2)(b)(1)(i), Only one responsible source.
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 541712 with a business size standard of 500. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. A statement of capabilities must be received by 11:00am, March 6, 2015 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required services. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Stacy.p.hill@noaa.gov by 11:00am, March 6, 2015.</p>

Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity:  
Department of Veterans Affairs, Rocky Mountain Acquisition Center, NCO 19; 4100 E. Mississippi Avenue, STE 900, Glendale, CO 80246
Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition, 

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:     
This is a sole source original contract request for a firm fixed price contract with Richard-Allan Scientific Company to provide 12 months of preventive maintenance on Thermo-Fisher Tissue Processors and Cryostats at Fort Harrison VAMC, Grand Junction VA Medical Center, and Eastern Colorado Health Care System.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  
This is a new preventive maintenance contract request to service existing Thermo Fisher equipment at Fort Harrison VAMC, Grand Junction VA Medical Center, and Eastern Colorado Health Care System.  The preventive maintenance includes a premium plan service agreement for all replacement parts, labor and travel expenses for any unscheduled service visits and scheduled service visits.  The preventive maintenance total cost is $43,856.00 for a one year period of performance as per below table:

Fort Harrison VAMC
Thermo Fisher Tissue Processor 
Model: A78400006 / Serial: EX40441201
Printmate Cassette Printer PM2189M1208
Slidemate Slide Printer 510186-03
Rotary Microtome 39619 & 37197
Period of Performance: Feb 2014 - Feb 2015
$23,538.00	Denver ECHCS
Thermo Fisher Tissue Processors, 2 each
Model A78400001 - Serial EX20010602 
Model B64100002 - Serial EX29350812
Period of Performance: Apr 2014 - Apr 2015
$15,908.00

Grand Junction VAMC
Thermo Fisher Cryostat
FSE / CC0173D1007
Period of Performance: Feb 2014 - Feb 2015
$4,410.00	

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), and FAR 6.302
     (X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   
Components and replacement parts of the Thermo Fisher Tissue Processor equipment are proprietary to Thermo-Fisher. Use of parts not validated by Thermo-Fisher will jeopardize the integrity of the equipment and VA's capacity to provide reliable patient care.
1.	Thermo-Fisher has the ability to perform a certified preventive maintenance visit to validate the performance of the equipment in accordance with Thermo-Fisher specifications.
2.	Thermo-Fisher provides a loaner option for the slidemate sub-component of the Tissue Processor.
3.	Thermo-Fisher service engineers have access to proprietary advanced service materials. Other companies are not licensed by Thermo-Fisher for this and are unable to access advanced levels of service materials.
4.	Thermo-Fisher only offers preventive maintenance through their subsidiary company, Richard-Allan Scientific, Inc., which is large business.  It was determined that no small businesses are available for this requirement through market research through Contractdirectory.gov, FPDS EZ search, VETBIZ, GSA eLibrary, SBA dynamic search, SAM, public Internet search engine, and Thermo Fisher Scientific official website.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  
Preliminary research found that Richard-Allan Scientific Inc. manufactures the Thermo Fisher Tissue Processor.  Preventive maintenance, repair and maintenance on the Thermo Fisher are proprietary and require new, OEM, proprietary parts and processes available only from Richard-Allan Scientific Inc.  Market research conducted revealed only one source available (see section 8 below for further details).  

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  
The anticipated cost will be fair and reasonable based on previous acquisition history in comparison with similar items in a related industry IAW FAR 13.106-3(iv).  A price comparison was conducted against previous contracts from different companies on similar laboratory equipment preventive maintenance (see Price Fair & Reasonable in contract file).  

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  
Market research was conducted on Contractordirectory.gov, FPDS.gov, VETBIZ, SAM, GSA, and Google which resulted in multiple Thermo Fisher subsidiary large businesses.  All companies belong to Thermo Fisher Scientific and consist of regional geographical territories pending supply and service product lines.  One Thermo-Fisher vendor, Thermo Fisher Healthcare, has a GSA schedule; however, their GSA schedule does not provide preventive maintenance service.  All market research conducted revealed a sole source entity.  It was determined there is only one source that can provide preventive maintenance services on Thermo Fisher equipment.  

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  None. 

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: None

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  
Each station and NCO-19 will continue to seek the latest and best equipment to satisfy the Government's need when equipment is due for replacement.  Searches through Internet, GSA schedule, VA contracts, etc. will be conducted for new equipment.  It is industry standard that proprietary maintenance and repair is required for laboratory equipment purchased.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-76.  NAICS Code is 811490. The Small Business size standard for this NAICS code is $7 million dollars. Request for Proposal (RFP) W25G1V-14-R-0019 applies. This procurement is being conducted under the requirements of FAR Subpart 6.1 Full and Open Competition, FAR 15, Contracting by Negotiation and FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  It is the intention of the Government to award a Firm Fixed Price single or multiple Blanket Purchase Agreement(s) (BPA) for the base period of three years. <br>  <br> Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD), Tobyhanna, PA, has a requirement for a service contract to obtain textile repair services at regional Source of Repair (SOR) facilities located at Ft. Hood, Texas and Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD), PA. Contractor will provide textile/fabric and material repairs or replacements, detailed technical inspections, and cleaning of the textile products IAW Technical and TYAD Manuals. This requirement will be for a base period of three years. Requirements will be in accordance with Performance Work Statement (PWS) (Attachment 2) for service requirement.  <br>  <br> Award evaluation and basis for award will be performed in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items. Offerors are cautioned award may not necessarily be made to the lowest priced offer.  <br>  <br> 52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br>  <br> 1.  Award will be based on best value.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br>  <br> 		(i)  TECHNICAL: Offeror's technical proposal should clearly reflect how the offeror proposes to comply with the performance required and identified in the Performance Work Statement. Offeror's technical approach, including any supporting documentation, is to be clear and concise and should clearly reference the Scope, Requirements and Functional Task Requirements identified in the Performance Work Statement.  Proposal shall include the terms of their best commercial warranty. This evaluation will result in a determination of technical acceptability or unacceptability.  Exceeding the technical requirements will not result in a more favorable evaluation since the overall technical evaluation will be Acceptable/Unacceptable. <br>   <br> 	     (ii)  PRICE:  Offerors are advised to provide the most competitive pricing they can with the initial proposal submission. <br>  <br> 		(iii) DELIVERY TIMEFRAME. Offerors are advised to clearly state acceptance to the twenty (20) day turn-around time for each system submitted in lots between five (5) to ten (10) systems.   <br>  <br> 		(iv)  PAST PERFORMANCE.  Offerors shall submit a list of all relevant Government and commercial contracts (prime and major subcontracts) during the past 3 years, which are relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation IAW Proposal Submission Instructions. <br>  <br> 		(a)   In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. <br> 		(b)   Nothing in this solicitation prohibits the Government from obtaining and considering past performance from any source available. <br> 		(c)   Negative information obtained during past performance evaluations will be provided to the offeror to be addressed unless such negative information or circumstances have already been addressed by the offeror. <br>  <br> To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than  quote mark Acceptable quote mark  must be achieved for Technical, Delivery Timeframe and Past Performance. Technical is significantly more important than Price, Delivery Time and Past Performance. Price is slightly more important than the Delivery Timeframe and Past Performance. Past Performance is of lesser importance than Price and Delivery Timeframe. The evaluation will determine the best overall value to the Government considering all factors. In the case of equal ratings, Price will be the deciding factor. Offerors are advised to provide the most competitive pricing they can with the initial proposal submission as it is anticipated that award may be made without discussions with offerors. Offerors are advised that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest priced offer.   <br>   <br> Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaire (PRAQ) (Attachment 3).  For all contracts identified in Section iv, Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaires must be completed and submitted.  The offeror shall complete Part I of the PRAQ and e-mail the questionnaire to both the Government contracting activity and technical representative responsible for each past/current contract or the commercial POC.  The contractor shall instruct the Government/Commercial POCs to electronically complete Part II of the PRAQ, and to then e-mail the entire questionnaire by the time and date identified as the solicitation closing date, to the Contracting Specialist at cheryl.a.saylock.civ@mail.mil.  The offeror shall provide the Contracting Officer a list of all the POCs (Company name/POC) who were sent a questionnaire in their proposal response and date e-mailed to POC (month/day). <br>  <br> 2.  To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than  quote mark Acceptable quote mark  must be achieved for the Technical, Delivery Timeframe and Past Performance Factors. <br>  <br> PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS: <br>  <br> 1. TECHNICAL CAPABILITY - The offeror's proposal shall demonstrate that they have the capability to provide the required textile (tent) repair service. Offeror will incorporate the knowledge and skill sets required pursuant to the Performance Work Statement (PWS) (Attachment 2) as well as past experience obtained from working on the same or similar projects. The offeror shall show in their technical proposal that they have a complete understanding of the requirement and a well conceived plan for satisfying the requirement.  The technical proposal shall contain:  Knowledge and Capability of all the  quote mark Documents Reference quote mark  in PWS; An Inspection Process/Program; Quality Assurance Program; and Employee Qualification/Certification requirements and resources available to meet all the requirements described in the PWS.  Proposal shall include the terms of their best commercial warranty. <br>  <br> Technical proposals must receive a rating of acceptable to be considered for award: <br>  <br> Acceptable = Proposal demonstrates a sufficient understanding of the requirements and the approach meets performance or capability standards. The proposal demonstrates no strengths or weaknesses or has one or more strengths that will benefit the government although not significantly.  The proposal has no material weaknesses but may have minor weaknesses that can be overcome. Weaknesses may potentially cause disruption of schedules, increase in cost, or degradation of performance if not addressed.  Special contractor emphasis and close government monitoring will probably minimize any difficulties of performance.  The proposal generally meets requirements; therefore, has an acceptable probability of meeting the requirements.   <br>  <br> 2. PRICING - Offerors are advised to provide the most competitive pricing they can with the initial proposal submission. <br>  <br> 3. DELIVERY TIMEFRAME - Offerors are advised to clearly state acceptance to the twenty (20) day turn-around time for each system submitted in lots between five (5) to ten (10) systems. <br>  <br> 4. PAST PERFORMANCE - Offerors shall submit a list of all relevant Government and commercial contracts (prime and major subcontracts) during the past 3 years, which are relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation IAW Proposal Submission Instructions. <br>  <br> 		(a)   In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. <br> 		(b)   Nothing in this solicitation prohibits the Government from obtaining and considering past performance from any source available. <br> 		(c)   Negative information obtained during past performance evaluations will be provided to the offeror to be addressed unless such negative information or circumstances have already been addressed by the offeror. <br>  <br> Each example shall have the following information: <br>  <br> Government Agency or Company Name and address <br> Customer point of contact (POC) and position within the company/agency <br> Customer POC telephone Number/email Address <br> Contract or Sales Number <br> Date of Contract or Sale <br> Dollar Value of Contract or Sale <br> Place/Period of Performance <br> Services provided <br>  <br> Relevance is defined as fulfilling the same or similar requirement for the same or similar quantities under the same or similar circumstances. An example which is considered to be ideally on-point is one which satisfied the same technical requirement for the same quantity, provided to a Government customer, and within the same delivery timeframe as required under this solicitation. It is not required to submit examples which are ideally on-point; however, offerors should strive to provide those examples which are as relevant as possible. <br>  <br> Quality is evaluated as overall customer satisfaction, including but not limited to: performance of the equipment and services provided; timeliness of delivery; willingness to negotiate and accommodate changes; cost control; processing of warranty claims; performance of maintenance agreements; availability of general customer support. <br>  <br> Should the offeror provide more than three (3) examples of past performance, the Government is not obligated to contact more than the first three. Offerors should confirm that the POC telephone numbers are accurate and in service; failure to provide valid telephone numbers does not obligate the Government to further pursue those examples of past performance. <br>  <br> In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. <br>  <br> Past performance will be evaluated as a risk factor on the following scale: <br>  <br> Low Performance risk = Verification of past performance shows that offeror consistently meets work schedules, provides specified services, meets contract terms without failure or resolves issues immediately, and has not been defaulted on any contract in the past three years.  There is little doubt, based on the offeror's performance record, that the offeror can perform the proposed effort. <br>  <br> Moderate Performance risk = Verification of past performance shows offeror meets work schedules and specified services most of the time, meets contract terms without failure or resolves issues immediately, and has not been defaulted on any contract within the past three years. Some doubt does exist however, based on the offeror's performance record, that the offeror can perform the proposed effort. <br>  <br> High Performance risk = Verification of past performance shows that offerors have consistently not met work schedules and other obligations, have defaulted on at least one contract within the past three years, or have chronically failed to meet contract terms, or the past performance information provided is not relevant to this requirement.  Significant doubt exists that the offer can perform the proposed effort. <br>  <br> Unknown Performance Risk = Little or no record of relevant past performance or, contact information (telephone, fax, e-mail) is not valid and the points of contact or agencies could not be reached.  Unknown risk rating has no positive or negative evaluation significance. <br>  <br> Nothing in this solicitation prohibits the Government from obtaining and considering past performance from any source available. <br>  <br> Negative information obtained during past performance evaluations will be provided to the offeror to be addressed unless such negative information or circumstances have already been addressed by the offeror. <br>  <br> A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice or withdrawal is received before award. <br>  <br> PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:  The pricing shall be filled out as follows: <br>  <br> Clin 0001:  <br>  <br> Service to provide textile/fabric and material repairs or replacements, detailed technical inspections, and cleaning of the textile products IAW Technical and TYAD Manuals.

FAR Clause 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options is also included in the combined synopsis.  Clause 52.217-8 is for the purpose of extending the performance under the contract as the Government requires, e.g., if the succeeding contract has not been awarded at the time of expiration and the services being provided are critical.  The performance may be extended more than one time, but the total extension may not be more than six months after the original expiration date of the contract.  Should the Government determine to use clause 52.217-8, the Government must notify the contractor in accordance with the clause.  <br>  <br> Evaluation of offers/quotes: <br> a)  If there are no other options in the solicitation, six-months worth of the base price will be added to the base for evaluation purposes.   <br> b)  If there are option amounts, the price evaluation will be the sum of the base amount, plus all the options, plus six-months work of the final option amount. <br>  <br> The offeror need not provide any new or additional pricing.  The above methods of evaluation are simply to comply with the evaluation requirement of 52.217-5. <br>  <br> This contract will be a firm fixed price contract for inspection, repair/replacement and materials, as needed, as referenced in PWS 4.0 Scope. <br>  <br> Material cost will be based upon contractor's submitted published price list per PWS, Annex A, Tent Repair Equipment List. <br>  <br> Pricing must be provided for all as indicated above.

All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. <br>  <br> 	HQ Army Materiel Command	 <br> 	Office of Command Counsel <br> 	9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 <br> 	Ft.

<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a <br />Plasma Cleaning System at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p>
<p>The Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) at the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) is issuing this solicitation for the purchase of two Downstream Plasma Cleaning Systems to support nanofabrication in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) user facility. The systems will be used as a shared resource to remove hydrocarbon contamination from the inside of electron and ion microscope chambers, sample holders and samples. These microscopes are accessible to researchers from industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies in the CNST NanoFab. <br /><br />GENERAL DESCRIPTION<br />Downstream or remote plasma cleaning is used to remove hydrocarbon contamination from the inside of electron beam and ion beam microscope chambers, sample holders and samples. The contamination forms from the breakdown of contaminants such as lubricants, vacuum grease, contaminated samples and untreated air. The breakdown of these contaminants form deposits on the sample surface and exposed instrument components while imaging, thereby reducing image contrast and resolution especially at low accelerating voltages.<br />The downstream plasma cleaner systems shall consist of a portable plasma source, control box, appropriate flanges for connection of the source to the specified microscopes, and the associated cabling and software. The systems shall be portable, and capable of being easily removed from one microscope and installed on another microscope. The plasma cleaning systems shall be capable of igniting and maintaining the plasma with the vacuum pressures inside the electron and ion beam microscope chambers with the turbo molecular pumps on. We are looking for three downstream plasma cleaning systems, one for cleaning a Zeiss NVision 40, one for cleaning a Zeiss Ultra 60 and one for cleaning a Li ion microscope based on an older FEI FIB chamber.</p>
<p>The system shall meet or exceed the technical specifications identified below. All items must be new. Used or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>All Offerors shall provide a quotation for the following line items:</p>
<p>Plasma Cleaning Systems.<br /><br />SEE ATTACHED REQUEST FOR QUOTE.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is NIHLM2015398 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation /contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-78. The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 334516 with a size standard 500 employees. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Digestive, Diabetes &amp; Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to procure Near-Infrared Imaging System for Quantitative Dual-Color (700nm/800nm) Western Blots and Microwell Plates.
<p>It is advantageous for the Government to find a Western blot infrared imaging system equivalent to the recently broken LICOR Odyssey imaging system. Occasionally other branches of NIDDK, have been using our system regularly for over 10 years. Without convenient access to such a device, research on many projects is slowed, in some cases to a halt.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />The NIDDK uses molecular genetics and biochemical approaches to understand the mechanisms underlying intracellular trafficking of lipids, nuclear proteins, and other factors regulating transcription, replication, and signal transduction. Researchers also explore the fundamental processes involved in cell cycle control, genome structure, and replication as well as the control of gene expression. Other areas of scientific interest include the glycobiology of development, stem cell biology, and epigenetics.</p>
<p>Most if not all these areas of research, either occasionally or on an ongoing basis, require Western blots for quantitative determination of protein levels in cells. NIDDK had a dependable LI-COR Odyssey Classic imager for over 10 years to satisfy this need, and nearby researchers from other branches in NIDDK also used the old imager. However, this older Odyssey imager has ceased working recently.</p>
<p>FEATURES:<br />Simultaneous two-channel detection (roughly 700nm and 800nm emissions) must be possible for multiplex sample analysis and/or normalization. For each channel, a dedicated and optimized excitation source and detection system must be provided for maximum speed and flexibility. One excitation source should be in the range 670-685nm and the other 760-785nm, to be compatible with existing protocols. Emission filters having band width of 20nm should be available for each detection channel, in order to obtain the highest possible signal-to-noise ratio. Automatic, optimized image capture that offers a dynamic range of greater than 6 logs in a single capture. Linear dynamic range of the detection system must be at least 5 orders of magnitude. Pixel resolutions range from &lt;25 &mu;m to &gt; 300 &mu;m should be possible. Scanned object must remain stationary during imaging. A sample area of at least 25 cm x 25 cm must be available.</p>
<p>Analysis software must be included that equals or surpasses the capabilities of Image Studio Software + In-Cell module TIFF must be a supported output image file format. Excitation source lifetime must be typically at least 40,000 hours of operation time before failure, to minimize operational costs. Upgrade option to add imaging capability of organs and small animals.</p>
<p>The offeror must include a completed copy of the following provisions: 1) FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial items; 2) FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items. As stated in FAR Clause 52.212-2 (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors will be used equally to evaluate offers: Technical Evaluation, Price, and Past Performance. 3) FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items; 4) FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; 5) FAR Clause 52-212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items - Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions.</p>
<p>Note: Past Performance Information: Vendors must submit a listing of the most recent contracts/awards (minimum of 3) which demonstrate similar work in nature to this Solicitation. Contracts/awards may include those entered with the Federal Government, state and local governments and commercial concerns. Include the following information for each contract or subcontract:</p>

<p>1352.209-73 Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) <br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />1352.209-74 Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2014)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>This is a synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The solicitation number is HSTS07-15-R-00027 which is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). This requirement will be an UNRESTRICTED acquisition. The proposed contract will be for one (1) base year and four (4) one year options. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 611699. Services anticipated beginning on or about April 15, 2015.
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a requirement for a firearms outdoor range to conduct mandatory quarterly qualifications and other firearms training. NOTE: THE RANGE MUST BE AN ESTABLSIHED RANGE; THIS IS NOT A REQUEST TO BUILD A RANGE. The outdoor range shall be within a 20 mile radius of the Detroit Metropolitan Airport. The proposed range must meet the following standards to qualify for consideration:</p>
<p>DHS will provide all AMMUNITION, TARGETS and FIREARMS INSTRUCTORS. The range time must be available exclusively to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during the hours indicated.</p>
<p>The range must be able to accommodate 20 shooters. Each shooter will fire approximately 250 rounds per day.</p>
<p>The range shall be capable of allowing leaded ammunition fire. The range owner will be responsible for lead recovery at the range. It shall have parking available on site for a minimum of 20 shooters at one time. The range shall have firing lanes up to 50 yards long. The range rules cannot disallow movement between firing points or restrict movement-oriented firearms firing points training by students (i.e. standing to kneeling transitions). The range rules cannot disallow students from drawing and firing from the holster. The range rules cannot disallow a student from moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present (i.e. tactical move and shoot type drills where instructor/student ratio would be too restrictive) The range must possess moveable barricades for the 25 and 15 yard line course of fire. The range most have target stands available to accommodate paper and cardboard DHS Transitional II targets.</p>
<p>DHS personnel will use the range an average of 18 days per year (3 days X 6 months = 18 days per year/from April 15th to October 30th) with an estimated 20 shooters per day. The estimated number of rounds fired per year is 90,000 (based on 20 shooters per day X 250 rounds per shooter X 18 days). The range must be closed to the public during the corresponding hours. Under this contract, DHS requires exclusive use of the range in 8 hour blocks from 8:00 AM to 16:00 PM. This does not include weekends and federal holidays.</p>
<p>Proposed Site Inspection</p>
<p>As part of the proposal evaluation process, TSA reserves the right to inspect all proposed sites to ensure compliance with all requirements set forth above.</p>
<p>The proposed contract will be for (1) base year and (4) four one-year options. The solicitation incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if given in full text. Full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at www.arnet.gov/far. The following provisions in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) apply to this acquisition. The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offers Commercial Items (July 2013) and the clause at FAR.52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Sep 2013) apply to this acquisition. FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) applies to this acquisition. Additional clauses applicable to this acquisition are listed later in this document.</p>
<p>At a minimum, offerors proposals shall include the following sections: (1) Qualification Statement, (2) Past Performance references, and (3) Price. The proposals will be evaluated using the factors as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Technical Factors</p>
<p>(1) Qualification Statement. Offeror shall confirm in writing that they meet all requirements set forth in this solicitation/synopsis. However, DHS reserves the right to visit proposed site(s) to verify that the range(s) meets minimum qualifications.</p>

<p>All evaluation factors, when combined, are more important than price. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation only if it can be determined that the responsible offerors proposal, conforming to the solicitation, will provide the most advantageous solution to the Government requirement, considering price and other factors. The Government reserves the right not to award a contract in response to this solicitation if it determines that none of the offers received provide the best value to the Government. In such a case, the Government will not be liable for any bid or proposal costs. Award may be made only to a contractor who has registered with the System for Award Management at https://www.sam.gov (formally CCR) prior to contract award. Additionally, offerors are advised that the following clause will pertain to any contract award: Release of Information: The Contractor shall not disclose, advertise, or release information about this contract to any individual or organization without prior written approval from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>PRICING<br />Offerors shall provide pricing to cover a (1) year base period and (4) one year options. Options will be evaluated at time of award. Pricing must be quoted on a 4 hour block basis. Pricing for the base year and 4 term option years must be submitted as follows:</p>
<p><br />Base Year and Four Options:</p>
<p>Base Year:<br />April 15, 2015 - April 14, 2016<br />Price per day = _____________ X 18 days = ___________</p>
<p>Option Year One:<br />April 15, 2016 - April 14, 2017<br />Price per day = _____________ X 18 days = ___________<br /><br />Option Year Two:<br />April 15, 2017 - April 14, 2018<br />Price per day = _____________ X 18 days = ___________<br /><br />Option Year Three:<br />April 15, 2018 - April 14, 2019<br />Price per day = _____________ X 18 days = ___________</p>
<p>Option Year Four:<br />April 15, 2019 - April 14, 2020<br />Price per day = _____________ X 18 days = ___________</p>
<p>Offerors are reminded to submit pricing for all years. A proposal submitted without pricing for a base and four one year term options will be considered technically non-responsive and may be removed from consideration for award.</p>
<p>Contractors will be permitted to bill on a monthly basis for hours used during the month. Invoice to be submitted only once a month.</p>
<p><br />The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order and may award without discussions. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation only if it can be determined that the responsible offerors proposal, conforming to the solicitation, will provide the most advantageous solution to the Government requirement, considering price and other factors. The Government reserves the right not to award a contract in response to this solicitation if it determines that none of the offers received provide the best value to the Government. In such a case, the Government will not be liable for any bid or proposal costs.</p>
<p>To be eligible for award, the offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (Nov 2013), with its quote.

<p>52-215-1 (4) Instructions to Offerors - Competitive Acquisition</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.</p>

Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable TFS estimates. <br />(3) Provide a statement specifying that "all pricing in the proposal is Firm-Fixed, with the exception of TFS".</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>Question #1: The solicitation noted that a 5,000 Gallon capacity truck can be accommodated on site. Does this mean that only a straight truck of this size will be able to maneuver and not a trailer of larger capacity? If so, should 3 deliveries be considered?</p>
<p>Answer #1: Yes, three deliveries should be considered. The delivery area most likely will not be able to accommodate a larger trailer.</p>
<p>Question #2: Many bidders farm these deliveries out to sub-contractors or have large companies supply the fuel and do the delivery. If this is a total small business set aside, shouldn't the subcontractor be a small business too?</p>
<p>Answer #2: Vendors have to comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, specifically for small business set-asides Parts 19.5 and 19.7.</p>

A Multi-Award Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract type is anticipated resulting in issuance of firm-fixed priced task orders.  It is anticipated that there will be a one (1) year base ordering period followed by four (4) one (1) year optional ordering periods.  <br>    <br>  General tasks within the scope of work may include the following:  <br>    <br>  Task 1: Exercise Support  <br>  The contractor shall provide support to various types of exercises, to include educational instruction, which examine issues and decision making processes at the strategic level, interagency level (including interagency activities), operational level, as defined in Chapter II, paragraph 2, Joint Publication 3-0 (17 September 2006, Incorporating Change 1, 13 February 2008) and for the strategic use of military power in joint and combined operations.  These exercises, however, reach down only to and include the level of major operations but exclude issues related to battles; they also exclude issues dealing with the tactical level.  The CSLD groups such exercises into four major categories: war-fighting, operations other than war, educational, and senior level decision making.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health, Division of Laboratory Sciences intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price maintenance agreement contract to Parker Hannifin Company, 242 Neck Road, Haverhill, MA 01835. This contract will be for a base year of 12 months with 4 option years of 12 months each.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement.<br /><br />The Division of Laboratory Sciences uses the Parker Hannifin Company scientific equipment (Domnick Hunter hydrogen generators) instruments in CDC laboratories to quantitate Trans Fatty Acids. A service contract is necessary to keep the hydrogen generators in prime operating condition. In order to ensure critical deadlines are met, it is crucial that these instruments are functional and able to run 95% of the time. The Protein Biomarker Laboratory must obtain a service contract which covers annual maintenance service, as well as needed repair services for these instruments. As initial warranties expire for purchased instruments, they need to be covered by a maintenance agreement, which provides preventive maintenance and required services to ensure that the instruments are maintained in optimal operating condition and are available to perform required analyses.</p>
<p>Parker Hannifin Company is the sole manufacturer of the Domnick Hunter hydrogen generators and the only company that is capable of offering trained and certified technical and scientific staff with field service engineers trained on the Parker Hannifin equipment. Additionally, Parker Hannifin Company has experience in troubleshooting, repairing, and completing preventive maintenance practices for the Parker Hannifin equipment. As the sole developer of the Parker Hannifin Company Domnick Hunter hydrogen generators, Parker Hannifin has the ability to assist the CDC with any function in Domnick Hunter hydrogen generators, including maintenance, necessary upgrades and updates, and method applications and development.</p>
<p>The equipment to be covered in the contract is included as an attachment to this notice.</p>
<p>No solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps. We will only issue a solicitation to Parker Hannifin Company. Parker Hannifin Company is the only source available to provide this service that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurement is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Ms. Tessa Buffington via email to vsr3@cdc.gov using solicitation number 2015-N-16884 in the subject line, no later than 6:00pm Eastern Time, March 14, 2015.</p>

<DESC>An RFP for 100% Small Business Set-Aside will be issued in the near future under this same RFP number, for the following:   <br>  <br> The contractor shall assist in transitioning ARNG providers with initial entry credentialing, maintenance of credentialing and privileging, and support the Centralized Credentials Privileging Board's review of completed credentials and privileging files.  The contractor shall also assist the ARNG-CSG in the development of the accessions credentialing process.  The contractor shall function as the primary point of contact with all ARNG providers for centralized credentialing and privileging.  The contractor shall provide program management and project technical services to insure performance to the specifications of the contract.  In the context of healthcare,  quote mark credentialing quote mark  describes a process of assessing and reviewing the qualifications of the health care practitioner.  It is a complex process and includes review of the licensure, training and education of skilled care providers (e.g. Physicians, Dentists, Family Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants) and assures their clinical competency and that they maintain regulatory compliance in their scope of practice. This process is mandated and defined in the civilian sector by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), the Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC), and the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC).  The credentialing and privileging process within the military is dictated by Army Regulation (AR) 40-68.   Privileging is the process that health care organizations employ to authorize practitioners to provide specific services to their patients.  In the military, the active duty Military Treatment Facility (MFT) serves as the health care organization.     <br>      <br>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). NHTSA's mission is to save lives, prevent injuries and reduce traffic-related health care and other economic costs. The agency develops, promotes and implements effective educational, engineering and enforcement programs with the goal of ending preventable tragedies and reducing economic costs associated with vehicle use and highway travel. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">NHTSA's Office of Behavioral Safety Research plans and conducts a national behavioral research, test, demonstration, and technology development program to build a scientific information base supporting development and implementation of programs to prevent or reduce unsafe behaviors of road users and to promote safe driving behaviors. Research areas include: alcohol-impaired driving, drug-impaired driving, non-use of occupant protection restraints; speeding and unsafe driving behaviors, pedestrian safety, motorcyclist safety, novice drivers, older drivers; driver education and training, enforcement, prosecution and judicial services; and emergency medical services. The Office of Behavioral Safety Research conducts research in the development of promising countermeasure programs to determine effectiveness; and evaluates selected State and local countermeasure programs and NHTSA demonstration programs aimed at reducing or eliminating unsafe actions and crash-generating situations. Examples of studies conducted by the Office of Behavioral Safety Research can be found at: http://ntlsearch.bts.gov/tris/ntlc/nhtsa/index.shtm. </span></p>

<DESC>PROJECT TITLE: Fiber Optic Switch
<p>LOCATION OF WORK: Supplies to be delivered to:<br />Radar Operations Center<br />1313 Halley Circle<br />Norman, OK 73069</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking sources capable of providing ABB Switzerland Pulse Power Switch Assemblies and associated Light Distribution Boxes or equal. NOAA is not seeking vendors to design, develop, and ten produce this requirement; we are seeking vendors already capable of providing a working solution.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this requirement is to replace the High Energy semiconductor switches used in the Line Modulator circuitry of the transmitter within the NEXRAD Weather Surveillance Radar WSR-88D. The switch, when triggered to the "On" state, discharges the Pulse Forming Network within the modulator which has previously been charged to 5200 Volts maximum. The large current which results brings a Klystron into conduction. The existing switch is made with Reverse Biased Diode Thyristors (RBDT's) which are becoming obsolete.</p>
<p>NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, in support of the NWS Radar Operations Center (ROC), seeks potential vendors to provide 245 High Speed Fiber Optic Switches with an accompanying Light Box.</p>
<p>This "Brand Name or Equal" procurement (FAR 6.302-1(c)) is of sufficient quantities of ABB Switzerland Pulse Power Switch Assemblies and associated Light Distribution Boxes to support the WSR-88D radar fleet.</p>
<p>Specific part numbers include:</p>
<p>ABB Switzerland LTD Part Number 5SVC 032708E130 Pulse Power Switch Assembly OR EQUAL</p>
<p>ABB Switzerland LTD Part Number 5SVB 020408T130 Light Distribution Box OR EQUAL</p>
<p>The salient characteristics of the existing RBDT switches are ten RBDT's stacked in series with suitable compression clamp hardware. Each switch has a minimum forward biased hold off voltage of 1100 volts giving the entire stack a hold off voltage of 11000 volts minimum. The normal forward biased stack voltage is 5200 volts maximum with an over voltage protection threshold of 5600 volts nominal. Provisions are made for proper operation with one RBDT shorted accompanied by the setting of a "Maintenance Required" alarm which alerts the operator of the problem. Due to the stringent availability requirements (96%) and unmanned nature of the NEXRAD transmitter, this feature is essential, especially in storm season. The Modulator is designed to operate with a maximum duty cycle of 0.004. The Modulator is capable of operation in two modes: Short pulse (1304 pulses per second maximum with a Pulse Width of 3 usec) and Long pulse (452 pulses per sec maximum with a pulse width of 6 usec). The switch must support this operation. The peak current per pulse is 896 amps maximum during the entire pulse width. Cooling air is supplied to the Modulator. Cooling requirements of the switch shall be stated in any responses to this request. The space available for the switch assembly is approximately 8 inches X 8 inches X 8 inches.</p>
<p>Specifically, NOAA requires the following units;</p>
<p>CLIN 0001 1EA High Speed Fiber Optic Switch with accompanying Light Distribution Box - First Article</p>
<p>CLIN 1001 4EA High Speed Fiber Optic Switch with accompanying Light Distribution Box - Limited Rate Initial Production</p>
<p>CLIN 1002 240EA High Speed Fiber Optic Switch with accompanying Light Box Optional Item - Full Production</p>
<p>DELIVERY SCHEDULE: First article units will be delivered to the ROC in Norman, OK 60 days after receipt of order. Developmental support units are due in 60 days of an approved First Article and full production is due within 6 months of LRIP.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding a fixed-price supply contract for the cables.</p>
<p>This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.</p>
<p>No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of contractor's information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Please submit information to include:</p>
<p>1) Your firm's DUNS number &amp; CAGE code;<br />2) Your firm's SBA certified small business concern status. Specifically identify if your firm is HUBZone-certified, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, or SBA 8(a) program certified;<br />3) A brief description of your firm's ability to provide a fiber optic switch ABB Switzerland LTD Part Number 5SVC 032708E130 and 5SVB 020408T130 or equal.<br />4) Identify any major work components that your firm would likely subcontract out.</p>

<DESC>THE RESPONSE DATE HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO 06 MARCH 2015.
<p>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to the following questions submitted to our Agency for solicitation N68335-15-T-0076:</p>
<p>(1) Question: The Statement of Work 5.9.1.1 lists the locations for wipe sampling, but no information is given as to the number of samples desired to be collected in each location. Are we to assume only 1 sample is desired for each location? It is difficult to give an estimate of numbers of samples to be taken without knowledge of each location. Number of samples desired was provided for air samples in section 5.8 but not for wipe samples in 5.9.</p>
<p>Answer: It is required that the contractor take enough wipe samples per area to ensure a good sample is obtained. This is solely the contractor's determination. However, it is recommended that 2 to 3 samples are taken to ensure a good sample is obtained.</p>
<p><br />(2) Question: Section 5.4.3 asks for results to be expressed in terms of STELs, however, there is no consideration for specific SETL sampling in section 5.8, only sampling for 8-hour work shift /nominal exposure periods. Please clarify the desire for STEL sampling for section 5.8 requirements.</p>
<p>Answer: The contractor shall monitor a shorter period to evaluate STEL levels. The workforce is available for the entire 8 hours. Short-Term Exposure Limits (STELs) - Per OSHA is average concentrations which should not be exceeded over a 15 minute time period.</p>
<p><br />(3) Question: Under Item 5.8.1 Blast Operation, 5.8.2 Painting Operations, and 5.8.3 Welding Operations, the SOW references collecting personnel and areas samples on one employee. Does this mean 1 sample on the employee and 1 area sample at each of those locations? <br /><br />Answer: It is required that the contractor take enough wipe samples per area to ensure a good sample is obtained. This is solely the contractor's determination. However, it is recommended that 2 to 3 samples are taken to ensure a good sample is obtained.</p>
<p><br />(4) Question: How large is each sample size area?</p>
<p>Answer: It has been determined that the dimensions of the sample area will have no impact on the contractor's ability to obtain an accurate sample. The contractor is expected to take samples of each area regardless of size.</p>
<p>(5) Question: Do you want the chromium (VI) speciated as hexavalent chromium? That is how this reads. This basically will double all the samples needed for speciation as hexavalent chromium, as a different sample and method of analysis is required to identify chromium (VI) from simply total chromium. Be advised that if a specific sample for all personal air and area samples as well as wipe samples will be needed to identify chromium (VI) as stated in the Statement of Work, it will double the amount of samples needed to be collected (and roughly double the cost of sampling). If you prefer total chromium measured, please let me know.</p>
<p>Answer: The Government does not require the chromium (VI) to be speciated as hexavalent chromium.</p>
<p>(7) Question: My question is, does a single visit mean one day on base, or can a single visit be two consecutive days, in any given quarter?</p>
<p>Answer: A single visit can be 2 consecutive days.</p>
<p>(8) Question: Section 5.8 states the same sentence for each of the three areas, blasting, painting and welding: The Contractor shall conduct personnel and area sampling for one (1) FRC ASE El Centro worker operating the Large Abrasive Media Blaster.</p>
<p>Does "personnel and area sampling" means sampling the one worker specified only in that area, or does it mean one sample for the worker, and a second area sample, for a total of two samples per area?</p>
<p>Answer: The number of samples taken is at the vendor's discretion to ensure enough data was collected to provide the reports.</p>
<p>(9) Question: What is the length of the contract, is it on an "on-call" basis" or for a specific number of operations/week or per month?</p>
<p>Answer: As specified in the Statement of Work, the service will be required on a quarterly basis for a period of one year.</p>
<p>(10) Question: Is this facility using isocyanates, as it would be very important to include this during the sampling of the paint booth due to the toxicity of isocyanates. Should this should be included or excluded from the quarterly sampling?</p>
<p>Answer: There is no requirement for isocyanates for VOC Testing.</p>
<p>(11) Question: Due to painting operations, does the client wish to have any VOC sampling or analysis completed at the paint booth?</p>
<p>Answer: As stated in the response to Question 10, there is no requirement for isocyanates for VOC Testing.</p>
<p>(12) Question: It is assumed that only 1 surface sample should be taken in each of the areas listed in 5.9.1.1 (for a total of 12 samples). However, the machine shop area lists several locations where surface sampling is desired. Please confirm the total number of surface samples desired each quarter.</p>
<p>Answer: It is at the vendor's discretion to determine how many samples they need to take for each area in order to obtain valid data for sampling / testing.</p>

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (SSC Pacific), intends to issue Request for Proposal (RFP) No. N66001-15-R-0095 for Custom Part Fabrication. SSC Pacific has the mission of rapidly developing technologies and systems for delivery to the warfighter.  SSC Pacific is funded by a variety of DOD organizations to deliver systems that fill critical capability gaps within a short timeframe.  To support the rapid prototyping, SSC Pacific requires custom part fabrication and finishing for projects throughout the center.  The part fabrication includes machining, lathing, milling, welding, sheet metal work, laser and waterjet cutting, 3D printing, plastic fabrication, finishing and urethane casting with a variety of metals and alloys.
Acquisition planning began in August 2014.  A market survey to determine small business capability was posted on SPAWAR E-Commerce Central on 24 November 2014 under reference number MKTSVY-0FA39A.  After thorough review of the small business respondents' capabilities, SSC Pacific intends to solicit the requirement as a small business set-aside.  Due to the nature of this requirement, contractors must be able to perform work at a contractor facility within 150 miles of SSC Pacific (53560 Hull Street, San Diego, CA 92152).
Multiple awards are anticipated.  The anticipated contract type will be Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity with a three-year base period and one two-year option period. Subsequent Task Orders will be issued for individual efforts. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 332710 and the Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.  The estimated value of the acquisition is $30M.
Potential offerors are encouraged to provide comment on the attached draft statement of work.  Due to the diverse requirements, potential offerors are encouraged to create industry partnerships to fulfill all of the Government requirements that are unable to be performed inhouse.  The Government intends to provide a brief industry conference in March 2015 for potential offerors to learn more about the requirement and ask questions.  Further information on the industry conference will be released at a later date via amendment to this presolicitation notice.
The final RFP is expected to be issued in May 2015.  The final RFP will only be available electronically. Electronic copies of the RFP may be obtained from the SPAWAR E- Commerce website at https://e-commerce.sscno.nmci.navy.mil under SSC Pacific "Open Solicitations".  Hard copy versions of the RFP and any subsequent amendments will not be available. Firms are encouraged to review the website regularly for important solicitation information.
