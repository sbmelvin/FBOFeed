The portable fire extinguishers shall be placed on one of two major camps of 500 occupants each, on one of two remote site camps of 16 occupants each, or in a DARS camp of approximately 70 occupants. Additionally, NAMSA is including a request for an additional quantity of optional equipment that may be required later for two additional 500-man camps or for miscellaneous uses. The acquired equipment shall be stored at the NAMSA Southern Operational Center in Taranto, Italy, when not deployed for operations or training and shall be refurbished there, as necessary, between deployments.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to the University of Southern California, Information Sciences Institute (USC-ISI), 4676 Admiralty Way, Marina del Ray, CA 90292 for an effort entitled "Radiation Mitigation by Arithmetic Codes (RadMAC)." The statutory authority for this non-competitive action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1).
<p>USC-ISI is the only responsible source capable of fulfilling this requirement without substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Under a prior contract effort, USC-ISI examined SEU mitigation effectiveness through analysis of the functional simulation results for RAC enhanced circuits at the discreet compute circuit level. The scope of this effort is to:</p>
<p>Explore and validate the effectiveness of residual arithmetic codes (RAC) by simulating and analyzing RAC circuits implemented in 45 nm and 32 nm silicon-on insulator (SOI) technologies. Using advanced simulation and design techniques based on graph organizational structure, RAC will be optimized to mitigate against single and multiple SEUs. To provide validation of RAC's effectiveness RAC will be imbedded into the processing chain of increasingly larger computational and processing circuits. Using SEU susceptibility information about the 45 nm and 32 nm SOI technologies from previous DTRA programs, this program will use a fault injection framework that includes cell radiation characterization information to accurately characterize RAC's effectiveness.</p>
<p>This notice of contract action is not a request for competitive proposals; no formal solicitation will be issued as a result of this announcement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the Government. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice. A determination to proceed with this effort on a sole source basis based upon capability statements received and evaluated in response to this announcement is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to modify the current single-source contract with Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC).

NGC provides the storage, installation, training, and engineering support of previously purchased and built FAA baseline NGC Digital Voice Recorder (DVR) and Rapid Deployment Voice Switch (RDVS) and Enhanced Terminal Voice Switch (ETVS).  The installation includes the upgrade of hardware and software, as well as, the repair and/or replacement of installation failures.  The FAA proposes to issue a contract modification against Contract No. DTFAWA-06-C-00013 to incorporate Small Tower Voice Switch (STVS) with NGC.  
The storage and installation activities will add one (1) year to the current nine (9) year contract for a total contract length of ten (10) years which will end on 08 February 2015 and increase contract ceiling.

There are no follow on requirements.

A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  Any firm that believes they have the technical ability to perform installation (including repair and/or replacement of installation failures), training, and engineering support for STVS are requested to submit their firms capability, qualifications and experience for the requirements outlined above and the FAA will evaluate such information accordingly.  

All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this RFI/Market Survey announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with RFI/Market Survey submissions will be solely at the interested partys expense.  .

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR NATIONAL FURNITURE BUY FOR TASK SEATING, CONFERENCE AND COLLABORATION FURNITURE

This is a market survey for National Furniture Buy For Seating, Conference and Collaboration Furniture.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from large businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing National Furniture Buy For Seating, Conference and Collaboration Furniture.

Excerpts from the Life Safety Assessment report pertaining to the tasks listed herein will be included in the resultant Request For Proposal/Contract; however, the A&E will be provided access to the entire life safety assessment from which the list of items to be designed was derived from.  

The AE will participate in project planning meetings, pre-performance meetings, communicate with VA personnel via telephone and e-mail; and is expected to coordinate so that the final documents include all requirements in accordance with industry standard practices, VA standards, and review comments. 

The AE will be required to perform Construction Period Services. 

I. Project Description

This project will address the design of specific life safety corrections in Building one (1) the Main Hospital. The scope of this project will include excerpts from a Life Safety Assessment Report conducted under a previous project.  

II. General Requirements

An Architect & Engineer (A&E) contract will be negotiated for the development of complete construction documents i.e., working drawings, specifications, reports, cost estimates and construction period services. 

The A&E design shall incorporate all architectural and engineering disciplines necessary to provide a complete and functional design.  Designs shall be in accordance with all applicable requirements of NFPA, EPA, ANSI, OSHA, National Plumbing Code, National Electric Code, ASHRAE, National Safety Code, VA Specifications, VA Construction Standards, VA Design Handbooks, etc. and all applicable local, state, and Federal regulations and standards.

Statement of Task to include the following:

Project Requirements:  In the course of the Life Safety Assessment report generated from a previous project, a number of particular deficiencies emerged as potentially significant cost factors for improvement at the Miami VAMC.  These are such either by their frequency or the complexity of potential modifications in individual cases, or both.  It is presumed that, generally, the present conditions were actually compliant at the various times that they were constructed.  

The selected AE shall be responsible for providing a detail design and cost estimate for he following:

Task 1- Exhaust air chases in the tower portion of Building 1.

On all tower floors 4 through 12, walled-in exhaust air chases are aligned with each other.  There are 24 to 26 of these on each floor, and they primarily remove air from patient and staff restrooms.  Per the original design, there are instances where there are no floors in these chases, making them multi-story exhaust air shafts of varying heights.  These open shafts require a 1-hour or 2-hour rating depending on how many floors each has penetrated, with the intention that such ratings limit passage of smoke between floors.  The exhaust air in these shafts is drawn out the tops of them by means of horizontal ducts in the corridors that gather air from a number of chases then extend up and through rooftop exhaust fans that run continuously.  In some of these chases there are access panels, and these are not rated.  At most of the restroom exhaust grilles, smoke dampers should be provided.  However, none are evident from recent work where chases have been demolished, and this forces a conclusion that none have dampers currently.   The PFI can vary.  The VA can continue the current reliance on continuous exhaust fans as the smoke control device.  Dampers could be proposed at the intermediate floor levels of chases, or at the current exhaust grilles, with access provisions to test and re-set them.  The LSA drawings show these chase ratings based on the 2000 Life Safety Code.   

Task 2 - Areas on the First Floor of Building 1 that are in excess of 200 feet to an exit (to the exterior).

This is a long-recognized circumstance, and one for which the VA retains waivers from the Life Safety Code requirement (19.2.6.2.2).  The floor area and layout is such that the circumstance probably cannot be practically eliminated entirely.  However, it also seems possible that the first floor does have some potential to create protected horizontal exit paths that could significantly improve the situation at a reasonable cost.  Design options could and should be explored that could significantly reduce the scope of areas too far from exits.  Such options could also potentially help address the situations described below in item 6.

Task 3 - Building 1 Exit Stairs emptying on to the First floor with no protected continuation to the exterior .

These conditions were likely compliant when newly built, and when subsequent remodeling has been accomplished.  They remain worthy of notice since there may be opportunities to improve them at reasonable cost. Similar conditions do not affect Building 10.  In addition to the fact that the conditions are covered via waivers, a consideration can be to weigh the importance of actual evacuation during fire emergencies.  The fact that some exit stairs are not arranged to do this results in a "deficiency."  However, evacuation is only one of several functions of the building's exit stairs.  They also (1) serve to separate floors as people use the stairs to move between floors in the course of daily work apart from any sort of emergency activity.  From inception, the building design includes features for a "defend in place" approach to protecting people in emergencies, including sub-division of floors into smoke zones, and 2-hour protection/separation between floors.  This means that stairs (2) can simply be used to move up or down one floor to be separated from a smoke or fire event.  (3) So evacuation of other floors to the exterior at the first floor is more like a last resort for some people in the building, while many others - non-ambulatory patients and their care personnel - use the smoke zone/smoke barrier on each floor to safely move away from a smoke or fire event.  So for them, the exit stairs do not play an initial role in their procedure.  These perspectives should have some tempering effect on determining the importance of any modification to the current building.  Specific circumstances are as follows:

Only one of the five tower stairs of Building 1 (those serving floors 4-12), allows evacuation direct to the exterior at grade.  This is Stair #8.  Two additional ones, Stairs #2 and #4, could possibly be modified at the First Floor landings to also achieve this.  Such changes would be in very small areas on the First Floor, would be somewhat complex, but could be low in costs.

For the "base" of Building 1, floor 3 is served by 6 stairs.  Two of them, Stairs #6 and #8, allow evacuation direct to the exterior at grade.  If Stairs #2 and #4 are modified for the tower stairs as discussed above, those also can help provide compliant evacuation for the third floor.

Floor 2 is served by 12 stairs. Seven of these, Stairs #3, #7, #8, and #11-14, allow evacuation direct to the exterior at grade.  As noted regarding the third floor above, if Stairs #2 and #4 are modified for the tower stairs as discussed above, those also can serve for the second floor.

It may also be worthwhile to explore options for item 5 above that can also provide egress to the exterior from additional stairs.

NOTE: The following deficiencies are part of this project and are listed in the Life Safety Assessment conducted under a previous project. These deficiencies are associated to  Task 1 through Task 3 above: 1.B.20; 1.1.10; 1.1.28; 1.1.103; 1.1.118; 1.2.53-59; 1.3.17; 1.3.27; 1.3.29; 1.3.30; 1.3.33; 1.3.43.  These deficiencies will be included in the resultant contract.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES (a) The <br> Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although  quote mark proposal quote mark  and  quote mark offeror quote mark  are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining information to serve as a market survey to assist in the development of a procurement strategy.  <br>  <br> Note:  This sources sought notice is an updated version of the previous sources sought notice posted under W31P4Q-12-R-0106 on 2 April 2012 for 'Sources Sought for Research, Development and Testing of Solid, Gel, Hybrid Rocket Propulsion Technology for Application in US Army Missile Systems (follow on to W31P4Q-08-D-0025 with Aerojet and W31P4Q-08-D-0026 with ATK) quote mark . <br>  <br> The Government seeks potential sources having the experience and facilities capabilities to perform full-rate production of tactical missile propulsion systems encompassing small diameter aviation rockets/missiles up to 18-inch diameter deep strike/air defense missiles.  The Government requests information on the potential source's knowledge, skill and experiences in research, development, and testing of solid rocket propulsion technology for application in US Army missile systems. This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued pursuant to FAR 15.2. The US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) Redstone Arsenal, AL, on behalf of the US Army, desires to obtain information to serve as a market survey to aid in development of procurement strategy for research, development, and testing of propulsion technology for application in US Army missile systems. As a result of issuing this RFI, the Government expects to receive information from potential offerors to assist in determination of the ability of potential offerors to develop and transition propulsion technology into tactical propulsion systems production operations.  No award is intended as a result of this sources sought notice nor does the Government intend to pay for information received.  Responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. <br>  <br> For questions regarding this RFI, please contact the Government contracting POC, Ms. Tammy Benson, via email at tammy.j.benson.civ@mail.mil. <br>  <br> The AMRDEC has requirements for research, development, and testing of solid rocket propulsion technology for application in US Army missile systems. Central to these requirements is a focus on controllable thrust, enhanced performance, reduced sensitivity, and safety/environmental compliance. Therefore, as part of these efforts, all technology development should address the specific issues of the goal at hand, whether that goal is controllable thrust, performance, reduced sensitivity, or safety/environmental compliance without neglecting any of the other goals central to this requirement. Due to technology transition objectives, the Government seeks to identify companies that have capabilities in research, development, and testing of solid rocket propulsion technology and the having the experience and facilities capabilities to perform full-rate production of tactical missile propulsion systems for Aviation, Close Combat, Precision Fires, and Air/Missile Defense.  Size ranges encompass propulsion systems for small diameter aviation rockets/missiles up to 18-inch diameter deep strike/air defense missiles.  <br>  <br> The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about the research, development, and production capabilities of potential offerors in the following technology areas: (1) New Ingredients and Materials: Propellant ingredients that are stable, compatible, processable, and cost effective for Army missile propulsion are among the ingredients to be developed, synthesized, and evaluated. These include high energy-density oxidizers, fuels, polymers, ballistic modifiers, processing additives, bonding agents, and plasticizers. In addition, new materials for composite cases, to include fibers, resins, insulators, and nozzle components that can enhance motor performance may be evaluated. Novel and/or improved processing techniques for propulsion system structural components may be employed to enhance performance, integration, and cost effectiveness. New ingredients must be characterized for heat of formation, density, purity, elemental analysis, stability, hazards properties, and if pertinent, crystal structure, molecular weight, equivalent weight, functionality, viscosity, and reactivity. Hazards associated with the preparation, analysis, and use of solid propellant ingredients and of those materials employed in the manufacture of rocket motor components or propellant are to be identified. Samples of promising new materials may be obtained or prepared and analyzed to deliver to the AMRDEC for verification. (2) Rocket Propulsion Technology: (a) Minimum Signature Propellants: Less sensitive high performance minimum signature propellants with an objective theoretical impulse density greater than 14.0 lb-sec/cu. in. that maximize producibility and minimize cost. (b) Reduced Smoke Propellant: High performance, reduced smoke composite propellants with an objective theoretical impulse density greater than 16.0 lb-sec/cu. in. that maximize producibility and minimize cost. (c) Composite (Smoky) Propellant: High performance composite propellants with an objective theoretical impulse density greater than 17.5 lb-sec/cu. in. that maximize producibility and minimize cost. (d) Rocket Propulsion Inert Components: Design, development, analysis and test of rocket cases, nozzles, insulators, and combustion chambers tankages for solid propulsion systems, to include controllable thrust devices/components may be conducted. Integration methods and processing techniques that enhance propulsion system performance, survivability and Insensitive Munitions characteristics may be designed, developed and evaluated. (3) Controllable Thrust Propulsion (CTP): Experimental and analytical investigations of approaches to provide a variety of thrust time profiles from a single motor design may be conducted. Approaches to be examined include barrier type pulse motors, bulkhead type pulse motors, and variable area nozzles. Aviation and Close Combat applications for this technology also require minimum signature, and therefore concept implementation must not preclude meeting this requirement or the requirement for Insensitive Munitions. Development and testing of structural and control components, propellants, or materials for CTP to validate the component performance and assumptions and to address the critical design issues may be performed. Specialized propulsion system testing may be conducted to verify the predicted effects of each developed component on the system performance described in this effort.  <br>  <br> As previously stated, the purpose of this RFI is to gather information about the research, development, and production capabilities of potential offerors in the Technology Areas identified.  Responses: To assist in market research associated with the research, development, and testing of propulsion technology, the Government is requesting information from industry.  Interested parties should submit white papers not to exceed 15 pages and no smaller than 12pt Times New Roman font. The white paper should include the following: (1) a brief description of any projects that the respondent's company is or has been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, which should include any relevant lessons learned; (2) any additional materials that are deemed appropriate by the respondent. The objective of this process is to assess potential offerors capable of achieving the stated objectives.  <br>  <br> All questions must reference RFI number W31P4Q-14-R-0029 and be submitted in writing no later than 3:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on 4 November 2013 to the contractual point of contact Ms. Tammy Benson at tammy.j.benson.civ@mail.mil; telephone requests for addition information will not be honored.  Question submittals must also include: Company name, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, and appropriate point of contact information.  <br>  <br> All RFI responses must be submitted to the contractual point of contact, Ms. Tammy Benson at tammy.j.benson.civ@mail.mil no later than 3:00 PM CST on 25 November 2013. The Government requests that the respondents deliver one electronic copy in Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF format.

The Government intends to award a contract to CPE since it is the engineering firm of record to date. Due to a 1.5 year delay in the construction start-up of this project additional engineering and design services may be required to the original design documents due to changes to the site that may have occurred during this delay. Additional engineering services may also be required during the construction of this project. As the engineer of record for four projects in the Louisiana Barrier Island Area (Chaland Headland, Pelican Island, West Belle Pass and the current project Chenier Ronquille), CPE has intimate knowledge of these projects and the area where these projects are located at and that a substantial duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through a competitive process. <br />Interested firms shall submit in writing, its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, business size and a brief statement regarding its capability to provide the required engineering and design services for the project above and also any unique qualifications within 15 calendar days from the date of this announcement.

The intended procurement will be awarded through FAR Part 36 Construction and Architect-Engineering Contracts. Although the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with the only known source, CPE, all responses received prior to the close of this notice will be considered by the Government. This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The Government reserves the right either to solicit offers based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or to issue a contract to CPE, whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the Government, without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br />Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. FURTHER, IT DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. <br /><br />The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent Federal agency with the primary mission of investigating civil aviation accidents in the United States and significant accidents in the other modes of transportation - railroad, highway, marine and pipeline - and using safety recommendations aimed at preventing future accidents.
<p>The NTSB has a requirement for telecommunications support for telephone service at the NTSB Headquarters located at 490 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Washington, DC 20594. The NTSB intends to issue a non-competitive contract to Verizon Maryland, Inc. (Verizon) located at 1 E. Pratt Street, 8th Floor, Baltimore, MD 21202-1128. This is a Fiscal Year 2014 requirement.</p>
<p>Verizon is currently providing this service via existing Verizon data lines. The technical risk would be significant if the NTSB were to change contractors for this requirement. If the NTSB did so, there could be a loss of service to both the NTSB and many of its clients during transition as mew data lines are installed and configured. These are telecommunications circuits that, in many cases, use hard-coded sending and receiving software. The cost to change contractors and to recode software would not be cost effective or in the best interests of the Government.</p>
<p>This requirement is conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items. The authority for this award is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), Soliciting from a single source. For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances, of the contract action, deem only one source reasonable available.</p>
<p>Sources capable of fully satisfying the above requirements are invited to submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government the necessary information to determine actual capability. At a minimum, this information, which must be prepared specifically in response to this notice, must include: 1. Identification of company or organization; 2. An assertion of existing, full capability to meet proposed requirements; 3. Business/contracts/marketing office point(s) of contact; 4. Notification of business size and/or special status; and 5. Any additional information that may be useful to the successful procurement of the requirements, if solicited.</p>
<p>These expressions of interest shall adhere to no greater than five page submission limit plus web links and any specialized product descriptions. The statement of qualifications should include only information that clearly demonstrates the respondent's capabilities, expertise, and experience to perform the requirements described in this notice. General marketing material should not be included. The NTSB prefers that companies do not submit proprietary material. However, the Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of your submittal. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which shall be considered by the NTSB. Parties must submit information within five (5) days of publication of this notice. NTSB will not return capability statements and the supporting documentation submitted in response to this notice. Telephone responses and inquiries will not be accepted. You may email questions, regarding this notice, to the issuing office: Ardena.Lovelace@ntsb.gov.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>This publication constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) notice pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e). The Government does not presently intend to award a contract but wants to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes. Written follow-up questions may be asked of responders for clarification, but this will not indicate a selection of preference. This is not a commitment to fund any effort submitted in response to this request. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland is seeking qualified sources that can provide enhanced air-to-surface capability for a Next Generation Targeting Forward Looking Infrared (NEXGENFLIR) system in a maritime mission environment.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Warfighting Objective</span></p>
<p>The F/A-18 &amp; EA-18G Program Office (PMA265) is exploring the potential development of a follow on Targeting FLIR (TFLIR) to replace the current TFLIR inventory. The F/A-18 NEXGENFLIR will be an Electro Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) targeting pod that provides greater capability than currently utilized systems to detect, classify, and track, both air-to-air, and air-to-surface targets. The NEXGENFLIR shall provide the capability to designate air-to-surface targets and will provide this capability to the end of the F/A-18 projected service life. Enhanced capabilities over legacy systems will include improved resolution and recognition ranges, improved tracking, aided target recognition, laser ranging/designation and integral datalink. Information provided via this request will be used to evaluate and assess the feasibility of a NEXGENFLIR pod to replace the current TFLIR, for an Initial Operational Capability in the 2022 timeframe.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL, COST AND SCHEDULE INFORMATION</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notional Requirements and Performance of NEXGENFLIR Pod</span></p>
<p>It is anticipated that the NEXGENFLIR will consist of a pod that is mounted on the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft. The pod contains a FLIR system with Electro Optic (EO) capabilities that can be used for targeting and visual identification beyond current system limitations. The system should include a Laser Spot Tracker (LST) capability that can track a target that is illuminated by a tactical laser source. It also has a Laser Designator and Ranger that can emit energy to designate targets and provide guidance for laser-guided weapons and measure range to target. Additionally, a Near-Infrared (IR) Marker capability provides air-to-surface target cueing to observers equipped with night vision devices (NVDs). NEXGENFLIR capabilities should improve the warfighters ability to employ ordnance against current threats, to include moving targets in a dense target environment. NEXGENFLIR should also increase reliability, maintainability and reduce total ownership costs.</p>
<p>Capabilities of interest for the NEXGENFLIR are:</p>
<p>&bull; Imaging in both the Medium Wave Infrared (MWIR) and visible (color) spectral bands<br />&bull; Active illuminated imaging in the Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) spectral band<br />&bull; Aided target recognition for infrared and visible imagery<br />&bull; Tactical laser target designation and ranging<br />&bull; Training laser capability supporting designation and ranging<br />&bull; LST search and track <br />&bull; Near-IR Marker capability for cueing for NVD devices<br />&bull; Two-way encrypted datalink for transmission of full motion digital video with metadata<br />&bull; Digital video output capability<br />&bull; Multiple moving target tracking with autocue capability <br />&bull; Digital video recording capability<br />&bull; Continuous zoom capability for IR and visible imaging</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Environmental Conditions</span></p>
<p>The NEXGENFLIR pod is expected to be carried on station 5 (fuselage station) of the F/A-18E/F &amp; EA-18G aircraft, operating in both the Carrier-based and forward deployed operational environments. Existing information for a potential sensor's capability to operate reliably in these environments will aid the assessment of the sensor's performance. Respondents to this RFI should provide any applicable testing or analysis information relevant to sensor storage and operation in the planned operational environment.</p>
<p>The system will be expected to meet performance requirements for day-night conditions with visibility down to 2.7 nautical miles (nm) at ground level, in all climates over all terrain exclusive of severe storm phenomena.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONTENT OF RESPONDENTS SUBMISSION</span></p>
<p>Respondents to this RFI should provide:</p>
<p>Technical Information:<br />&bull; A description and performance assessment of the NEXGENFLIR pod</p>
<p>&bull; A description of the technical risk areas in the NEXGENFLIR pod development, integration, demonstration, and manufacturing program phases.</p>

<RESPDATE>031113
<CONTACT>POINT OF CONTACT: Brooke Pyne, NSWC Technology Office, e-mail Crane_TEO@navy.mil, 812-854-4823.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) conducts Research and Development (R&D) directed toward Strategic Missions, Special Missions and Electronic Warfare/Information Ops in support of our nation's warfighters.  The Strategic Missions area encompasses the full range of DoD activities that alter an adversary's will and ability to attack the United States and it interests, the area's primary technical areas include Threat Detection, Integrated Missile Defense and Global Strike.  The Electronic Warfare/Information Ops area supports any military action using electromagnetic energy to control the electromagnetic spectrum or attack an adversary; this area's main focus includes Electronic Attack, Electronic Warfare Support and Electronic Protection.  The Special Missions area supports military forces engaged in Special Operations, Irregular Warfare and Riverine Operations, this area's primary technical areas include sensors & communications, mobility & maneuverability, special munitions & weapons, and training.  Our mission is to provide Acquisition, Fleet Support, Acquisition Engineering, R&D, Product Engineering, Systems Engineering, Test & Evaluation, Logistics, Maintenance & Repair, Legacy Systems/Products, and Program Management.  Within these mission areas the Division is responsible for the full spectrum of R&D, acquisition, and fleet support.  Typical functions include fundamental research; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; and development of operational systems.  NSWC Crane is interested in receiving proposals for R&D in all of its mission areas.  This notice constitutes a combined synopsis/Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2).  It is intended that this BAA be open for a period of three years from the date of publication. Proposals may be submitted by any non-governmental entity including commercial firms, non-profit organizations, and institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia comprising such concerns.  NSWC Crane encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions (HBCUs/MIs).  However, no part of this BAA is specifically reserved for HBCUs/MIs.  The following guidelines apply to concept papers or proposals.  Typically each proposal may be: (1) funded incrementally for periods up to three years subject to the availability of appropriations; (2) funded between $10,000 to $5,000,000, with the size of each dependent upon the topic (although NSWC Crane reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds); (3) more than one effort may be funded for an individual topic area; (4) NSWC Crane is not interested in concepts that already have been developed or proven (even if they never have been sold before); (5) NSWC Crane seeks proposals for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding; and (6) deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation rather than focus on a specific system or hardware solution.  Proposals for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and would not be considered for funding.  In order to minimize the cost regarding proposal preparation, as a preliminary step, interested parties are strongly encouraged to submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as "white paper").  This white paper should not exceed 10 pages, with an executive summary (short paragraph) on the effort, a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, current Technology Readiness Level (TRL) (see attached APPENDIX 6, TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVELS AND THEIR DEFINITIONS an anticipated TRL if project is funded, and a rough cost estimate.  Offerors should submit the white papers electronically.  A title, BAA number, offeror name, project duration, approximate cost, and a brief abstract with information explicitly pertinent to the proposed work must accompany the white paper.  The Government reserves the right to request a proposal from any, all, part of, or none of the offerors submitting white papers.  Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit full technical and cost proposals on all or part of their white paper submission. However, any such encouragement does not assure a subsequent award.  Offerors may submit full technical and cost proposals even if they did not submit a white paper or their white paper was not identified as promising.  The Government will acknowledge the receipt of white papers and full technical and cost proposals by e-mail.  White papers (and any resulting proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific, technical, and socio-economic merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential naval relevance and contributions of the effort to NSWC Crane's specific mission areas; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to NSWC Crane programs are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered to NSWC Crane with unrestricted (at least Government Purpose) rights; (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader o! r other key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; and (6) Realism/reasonableness of the proposed costs and the availability of funds.  These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more important than price.  Based on evaluation of the white papers, participants may be selected and invited to submit full technical and cost proposals for evaluation by NSWC Crane using the above noted evaluation criteria.  An invitation to submit a full proposal does not guarantee funding. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED.  For efforts funded as legally binding commitments, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions.  This is to notify potential proposers that each grant or cooperative agreement that may be placed under this announcement or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the following clause: "As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents, the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students. If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement!  and all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements, and it may suspend or terminate such grants and agreements unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award."  If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any grant, including any existing grant; (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a grant or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation.  Any commercial firm or institution of higher education may submit a proposal.  There is no longer a requirement that the entity be U.S. in origin.  White papers may be submitted any time prior to expiration of the BAA.  There is no set date for submission.  The following e-mail point of contact is provided for information regarding technical programs/technologies of interest within the warfare areas supported by NSWC Crane and for submission of white papers and proposals: Brooke Pyne (e-mail Crane_TEO@navy.mil).

All services will be performed on-site at the VA Palo Medical Center.  The contactor will generally be working with staff cardiologists.

2. Specific Contractor Tasks include:

Contractor to provider Ambulatory ECG Monitoring System and Web-based Clinical Reporting Module

Device:  Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry (MCOT)/ w/Event Monitor

Purpose:  Cardiac symptoms are often transient in nature such that it is difficult to obtain an ECG the exact time they occur. Oftentimes, clinically relevant abnormalities and life threatening rhythms have no cardiac symptoms. Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry (MCOT) or the wEvent monitor is the solution to this problem. MCOT and wEvent are used for patients experiencing intermittent symptoms, such as palpitations, syncope, dizziness, and shortness of breath. Patients are provided with state of the art technology in the form of a portable device which allows them to record their ECG in real time while symptoms are actually occurring. In each device, there is an Auto-Trigger technology which offers ECG monitoring that is programmed to recognize rhythms such as atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia and asystole. When the device recognizes these rhythms, it automatically records the patient's ECG, independent of the patient physically activating the device. This technology captures dysrrhythmias when they would otherwise go undiagnosed. The ECG is automatically transferred to Contractor's cardiac monitoring center, where it is immediately reviewed and the cardiologist is informed according to pre-selected notification criteria.

Location: Cardiovascular Out Patient Clinic/The Patient's Home

Procedure: The device is given to patients to use for 2 weeks to 1 month depending on the indication for MCOT/wEvent monitoring. Initially, EKG technicians will instruct and explain to the patients about what the device is, how to use it, how to hook it up, and how to place leads. They will then hook up the device, and let the patient go home with specific instruction in order to continue to have the device on for the duration of evaluation. Contractor will schedule a call with the patient to establish a baseline from home. Alternatively, the monitor will be sent directly to the patient, and the patient will be hooked up at home.

After the evaluation period, the patient returns the device to the company in the UPS envelopes provided. 

Data Management: 	
1. Data is transmitted wirelessly via cell phone towers. While patient is wearing the device, daily reports will be made available to VAPAHCS via fax or online. When asymptomatic and/or symptomatic ECG events are transmitted to the Contractor, an alert is sent out to the ECG director for evaluation. The computerized results will then be generated and this is seamlessly assimilated into the VAPAHCS clinical records. An End of Service Summary Report is often available 3-5 days after the monitor is shipped back to Contractor (Access to the data from the website is limited to the physicians and/or any other authorized representative responsible for evaluating the data.)

2. ECG Evaluation:  Once the ECG data is ready for evaluation, the company alerts the department in 2 ways. The company initiates a call to the cardiology department and sends the data via fax to alert the authorized representative. They call the department to alert the  TBD by VAPAHCS.
			
The device has been tested and certified by the Biomedical department. The associated web based application has been evaluated secure by IRMS and the Security office. This web site is also accredited by Health and Human Services. 

Contractor reporting site has been developed enabling access to patient reporting 24 hours a day at the physician's or authorized representative's convenience through password protection. Contractor site provides the following data:
1.	Enrollments - the ability to enroll patients directly on line or fax Reports - a convenient access to your patient reports. These reports can be sorted by your preference and printed individually or in a batch mode
2.	Contact Us - communication directly to Contractor customer service
3.	Account Info - to view or change your account set-up and preferences. 

Quality of data is tested initially when the patient is first attached to the device. The EKG technician will test the device and will test transmission to the company. 

If applicable, medical record documentation must be sufficient to supports patient care and VHA medical cost care recovery initiatives. Complete all other documentation as required by VA/VHA/ Medical Center regulations, policies, or procedures Attend VA meetings regarding quality assurance/improvement, JCAHO compliance, etc., if assigned.

Hill Blvd., Joint Base Charleston (JBCH), SC intends to award a sole source contract for service and maintenance for the AT&amp;T owned cable on JBCH-Weapons Station (WS).</p>
<p>The 628 CONS intends to make an award to Bellsouth Telecommunication, Inc. 2180 Lake Blvd, Atlanta, GA, 30319-6004 doing business as AT&amp;T. Market research was performed and information gathered has determined this company to be the only source for this requirement due to proprietary ownership of the cabling and equipment.</p>
<p>In accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 5.207(c) (16) (ii), the proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).

A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>FAR 52.232-18 AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS - Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer</p>
<p>The justification for the sole source requirements as follows:</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.303-2:</p>
<p>(1) Agency and Activity: Agency-628 CONS, Activity-628th Communications Squadron</p>
<p>(2) Nature of action being approved: Sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>(3) The purpose of this acquisition is to provide all management, tools, equipment, and labor necessary to perform telecommunications Outside Cable Plant maintenance services to approximately 188 buildings on JBCH-WS for a period of 2 months.</p>
<p>(4) Justification Rationale: IAW FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) the required services are available from only one responsible source.</p>
<p>(5) Demonstration of Unique Qualifications: AT&amp;T is the only entity able to provide the required service due to their proprietary rights to the cabling and equipment.</p>
<p>(6) Description of Solicitation Efforts: PER FAR 5.202-(a)(13) previous notice synopsized actions were not taken.</p>
<p>(7) The contracting officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based upon a comparison of the proposed price with prices found reasonable on previous purchases, and with the governments independent estimate.</p>
<p>(8) Description of market research: Eight NETCENTS contractors were solicited, however the incumbent contractor and owner of existing cable equipment, AT&amp;T, will not permit other sources to have access or rights to their cable equipment</p>
<p>(9) Other supporting facts: AT&amp;T is the current contractor and any attempt to solicit another source would not be cost effective to the government.</p>
<p>(10) Interested Sources: No sources have expressed any interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>(11) Actions to prevent barriers that may lead to restricted consideration in the future: Continue to survey the market for alternate sources.</p>
<p>(12) This justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>

<p><span style="color: black;">Despite recent advances, clinicians and researchers remain limited by the tools available to study, understand, and treat systems of the brain. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>To achieve maximum benefit, clinicians are often forced to complete a slow, repetitive, and imprecise cycle of observing behaviors and fine-tuning drug or behavioral therapy until the effects of a disease are reduced. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span>The science has, to this point, been largely based on a century of identifying associations between features of complex behaviors and diffuse understanding of the brain.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">SUBNETS seeks to move beyond this limited understanding to create new interventions based on new insights that can be gained from the intersection of neuroscience, neurotechnology, and clinical therapy. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>While there is no question that brain activity, anatomy, and behavior are functionally linked, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that many neural and behavioral processes are not localized to specific anatomical regions, but are emergent from systems that span several regions of the brain. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>SUBNETS will attempt to establish the capability to record and model how these systems function in both normal conditions, among volunteers seeking treatment for unrelated neurologic disorders, as well as among impaired clinical research participants. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>The goal is to alleviate the burden of psychiatric and neurological disease through multi-region recording and stimulation by observing neural dysfunction, modeling the relationship between neural systems and behavior, and applying an intervention through neural actuation.</span></p>

<p>Posted Date: 24 OCT 13 <br />Response Date: 08 NOV 13</p>
<p>Contracting Office Address: National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, 3838 Vogel Road, ATTN: Sue Pollmann/MS L-13&nbsp;, Arnold, Missouri 63010</p>
<p>This announcement is for information purposes only. The suggested North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541370. The Government seeks to identify interested offerors for this potential procurement action and to gather information that may influence the shape of any future Request for Proposal (RFP). This announcement does not constitute an RFP and it does not restrict the Government to any ultimate acquisition approach or strategy. This announcement does not represent a commitment by the Government in any form. The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this announcement. This is not a request for proposals, quotations or bids.</p>
<p>1.0 Background</p>
<p>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) provides timely, relevant, and accurate geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) in support of national security to the National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG). The NSG is the combination of technology, policies, capabilities, doctrine, activities, people, data, and communities necessary to produce GEOINT in an integrated multi-intelligence, multi-domain environment. As part of this responsibility, NGA must maintain a posture of worldwide readiness as well as providing mission responsiveness in a tactical timeframe. A key element necessary to support global readiness is the availability of a current and accurate worldwide image base to ensure a common operational picture for all users. This image base consists of orthorectified and orthomosaiced imagery available on the NIPR, SIPR and JWICS networks for both visualization and chip and ship/download capability, and deliverables available via self-service, assisted service, and full service interfaces. It will contain accuracy information at the pixel level. These ortho holdings serve as the image layer to the NGA Map of the World (MoW), compliant with the MoW Concept of Operations (CONOPS); provide direct support to the varied missions of the NSG and the Federal community. The ortho base also provides image source to NGA analysts for feature extraction and production efforts, and will utilize change detection technology to help address currency prioritization. Other users of the data could be another federal agency, DoD, Foreign partner, and/or vendor(s) contracted by the USG.</p>
<p>Through this announcement, NGA is seeking innovative industry approaches to orthorectifiy, manage, host, and deliver ortho image holdings. The response should integrate and consolidate existing capabilities to support the NGA Service Model. Integration is required among the robust capabilities of the commercial satellite industry which is currently delivering over one million sq. km. of imagery daily, in addition to NSG generated data.</p>
<p>2.0 Global Foundation Ortho Image Program Specifics</p>
<p>A key agency priority is to provide global imagery coverage and the tools to support the customer via the self-service component of the NGA Self Service Model (defined below). The global foundation ortho image program will display the following characteristics:</p>
<p>&bull; A current, accurate, and void free global orthomosaic of best available image sources is available to users on all NGA networks and .www web hosting for direct access. Void free is defined as the elimination of significant image anomalies, e.g. clouds, flaring, etc. The orthomosaic is maintained according to currency and accuracy specifications as provided by NGA.<br />&bull; The global orthomosaic becomes the image layer for the MoW. The currency and accuracy of this orthomosaic fully supports the NGA posture of Global Readiness.<br />&bull; The global orthomosaic is a baseline against which the change detection algorithms are run.<br />&bull; The global orthomosaic is updated continuously, to capture changes, remove image anomalies, maintain required currency, or in response to scheduled production plans.<br />&bull; The orthomosaic consists of various image sources, but is maintained as an UNCLASSIFIED product. Although UNCLASSIFIED, the image products will be distributed on Classified networks.<br />&bull; Ortho Imagery is maintained in a database structure with all necessary metadata available to support robust orthomosaic production.<br />&bull; Orthomosaics support current mission planning and battle command systems and future replacements.<br />&bull; All acceptable imagery to be hosted to an OGC-compliant Web Hosting Service (WHS) will be orthorectified. NGA will moderate and track access for appropriate users. User access can be geographically constrained to appropriate areas of interest. "State of the art" tool capability will be continuously maintained within the WHS.<br />&bull; Imagery is available for immediate visualization, for chip and download into an analytical workspace, or for large volume deliveries in selectable formats via appropriate transfer protocols.<br />&bull; Orthomosaics are maintained at native image resolution (currently 0.5m). The image holdings can be resampled or reformatted to produce various image resolution data sets.<br />&bull; Orthorectification capability will be available to users via the widget framework.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data Specifications<br />Currency - 1, 3, 5 year by area as specified by NGA</p>
<p>Horizontal Accuracy - The Accuracy Threshold is CE90&lt;20 meters. The Accuracy Goal is CE90&lt;8 meters</p>
<p>Data Integrity - Shear is maintained at less than 2 meters. Imagery can be reformatted to user requirements without introduction of imagery anomalies.</p>
<p>Metadata - Sensor, currency and accuracy data shall be available to permit reliable characterization of orthomosaic products.</p>
<p>Use Metrics - Metrics will be maintained with characterization available by customer, volume, and area of access.</p>
<p><br />3.0 Information Desired</p>
<p>Request interested and qualified sources address the following in accordance with the submittal instructions below:</p>
<p>&bull; Relevant Corporate Knowledge/Experience</p>
<p>&bull; Provide a corporate capability statement that describes your core competencies in each of the bulleted key areas under the Global Foundation Ortho Image Program Specifics, Paragraph 2.0.

<a href="mailto:richard.williams18@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The Department of  Veterans Affairs, Canandaigua VA Medical Center, 400 Fort Hill Avenue, Canandaigua, NY 14424-1159 intends to enter into a contract on the basis of other than full and open competition with only one source, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, 120 Wall Street, 29th floor, New York, NY 10005, under the authority Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 (a)(2) only one responsible source, 10U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1).   The requirement is to provide a license agreement for the Veterans Self-Check Quiz for an Interactive Screening Program (ISP) that integrates with the existing Veterans Chat Program in collaboration with the VISN 2 Center of Excellence Suicide Prevention Hotline.  The Veterans Chat program enables Veterans, their families and friends to go online where they can anonymously chat with a trained VA counselor. If the chats are determined to be a crisis, the counselor can take immediate steps to transfer the visitor to the Veterans Crisis Line where further counseling and referral services are provided and crisis intervention steps can be taken. The Veterans Chat program is intended to reach out to all Veterans who may or may not be enrolled in the VA health care system, and provide them with online access to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and the VA's suicide prevention services. The Interactive Screening Program (ISP) is an online method of outreach to populations at risk for suicide, which has been developed by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP). The ISP includes an online questionnaire that screens for key mental disorders and other conditions that are associated with elevated risk of suicidal behavior in selected target populations. Questionnaires submitted by ISP users are computer-classified into one of four tiers, depending on suicide risk, and then are routed to designated counselors for assessment and personalized response to the individual user. The system provides the counselor a tier-specific template to use in preparing the response, which is augmented with comments related to issues of particular concern that are indicated in the user's questionnaire. The program then allows the user and the counselor to exchange online messages, through which follow-up options, as well as barriers and resistances to mental health treatment, can be explored and resolved.  No substitutes will be accepted due to the fact these sources are used on an ongoing means for the staff to perform their necessary studies.                                     								                                                            The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 611710, Educational Support Services, with a corresponding small business size standard of $14 million. The estimated date of award for this action is November 1, 2013. The intent is to award a sole source, firm fixed price (FFP) contract. 

This notice is not a request for proposal and no solicitation will be issued. All responsible parties that believe it can provide the stated services should provide supporting documents demonstrating their capability and specifications.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely by the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 
Responses received will be used for future acquisitions. Information can be sent to Richard Williams, Contract Specialist, at richard.williams18@va.gov.  No telephone or facsimile requests will be accepted.  Responses must be submitted by October 30, 2013 at 2:00 p.m. EST.

An allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (j) of this clause.<br />(b) For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government." As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for those item(s).<br />(c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for a subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government."<br />(d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly.<br />(e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled "Disputes."<br />(f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause.<br />(g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled "Default." The provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of funds for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause. This clause no longer applies once the contract is fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause.<br />(h) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government."<br />(i) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342.<br />(j) The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to this contract in accordance with the following schedule:<br />On execution of contract $ _TBD_____<br />(month) (day), (year) $ _TBD_____<br />(month) (day), (year) $ _TBD_____<br />(month) (day), (year) $ _TBD_____<br />(End of clause)<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<DESC>R14PS94007 BPA Construction Material and Supply Services
Combined Synopsis/Solicitation: The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement for the establishment of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for the period of December 1, 2013 through November 30, 2018 for Construction Supply Services.  It is anticipated that multiple BPA awards will be the result of this announcement.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 423390 Other Construction Material Merchant Wholesalers.  This small business size standard is $5.7m.  This procurement is 100% set-aside for small business.  
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The solicitation document and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-26 (June-2008).  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Solicitation Number for this Request is R14PS94007.
Background: Provo Area Office Force Account (PAOFA, FA) developed during the mid-1990's as an extension of support services for its materials and testing group.  In addition to supporting material and testing services, heavy equipment operators and civil engineering technicians provided valuable and immediate services during emergencies, and necessary repairs and maintenance of Reclamation facilities. This remains the primary role of FA; however, emergency and repair work is challenging to predict and plan for.  In order to maintain its capabilities, and ensure its existence at times of need, FA began doing repair and rehabilitation work agency-wide, and interagency-wide, within the Reclamation jurisdictional area. During the mid-2000's Reclamation performed its "Managing for Excellence" (M4E) studies.  Team 11 presented their report of cost comparisons for in-house versus outsourcing.  The concluding scope statement notes, "In today's engineering and construction climate, it is imperative that Reclamation make a concerted effort to collaborate with customers and stakeholders such that our operations are transparent and efficient.  At the same time, Reclamation must take positive steps to maintain our core technical capability in order to remain good stewards over our dams and other facilities."  Thus FA provides a constant presence for emergency demands and maintains some core technical construction capabilities where individual project or facility characteristics and demands may not, due to economic or time constraints, lend themselves to execution and administration through conventional contracting.
Given this role, FA is in consistent, and sometimes unpredictable, need of materials and supplies to accomplish assigned tasks in a timely and efficient manner.  Regularly, during active construction, crews will encounter unplanned modifications to scope, requiring immediate procurement of materials and supplies.  The intent of this BPA is to meet this need by providing construction material and supply needs in all regions FA performs services.
Possible Locations of Service: Force Account provides in-house construction services on Reclamation facilities, and on facilities of other federal agencies.  These services vary widely from embankment dam repair work to wetland mitigation construction efforts.  The location of construction also varies, and may be located anywhere in the 17 western states; however, the preponderance of construction projects fall within two general geographic areas.
North Region: The North Region is defined as the area north of the southern borders of Utah, Colorado, Kansas, and north of 37 degrees latitude in Nevada and California to the southern Canadian border, west to the pacific coast, and east to the eastern borders of Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota. The primary zone for construction projects is northern Utah and eastern Colorado; however, projects may be completed in any location within the region previously defined.  Following are examples of pertinent project locations that indicate geographic areas FA has completed work - the examples do not, however, represent locations work will be completed, although, on occasion, the construction crew is requested back to previous jobsites: 		 Battlement Mesa Dam III, Parachute, Colorado	Crooked Creek Dam, Eagle, Colorado Crystal Lake Dam, Ouray, Colorado		Cedar View Dam, Neola, Utah Thunder Ranch Levee, Jensen, Utah		Provo River Rehabilitation, Heber, Utah Humbug Pond, Heber, Utah			Fontenelle, Wyoming Ochoco Dam, Oregon			MIAD, Sacramento, California Echo Dam, Utah				Newton Reservoir, Utah Myton, Utah				Trenton Dam, Nebraska Enders Dam, Nebraska			Stamped Dam, Truckee, California Prosser Dam, Truckee, California		Angostura Dam, South Dakota
South Region: The South Region is defined as the area south of the southern borders of Utah, Colorado, Kansas, and South of 37 degrees latitude in Nevada and California to the northern border of Mexico, west to the pacific coast, and east to the eastern borders of Oklahoma and Texas.
The primary zone for construction projects is along the Colorado River Corridor from Las Vegas, Nevada to Yuma, Arizona; however, projects may be completed in any location within the region previously defined.  Following are examples of pertinent project locations that indicate geographic areas PAO FA has completed work - the examples do not, however, represent locations work will be completed, although, on occasion, the construction crew is requested back to previous jobsites: 		 Las Vegas, Nevada				Moapa, Nevada Parker Dam, California/Arizona		Blythe, California Imperial Dam, California/Arizona		Beal Lake, Arizona Needles, California				Chama, New Mexico Flagstaff, Arizona				McClellan Dam, Texas Davis Dam, Nevada/Arizona			Navajo Dam, New Mexico
This BPA will require vendor's ship requested supplies anywhere within the designated geographical area, north or south, to the jobsite associated with the requested supply.  Delivery urgency and acceptable lead times will be a function of market availability, and project requirements communicated at the time a request is made. A map depicting the North Region and South Region, including locations of previous projects that illustrates geographic areas of greater project density can be requested from the solicitation point of contact since this solicitation format does not allow maps to be uploaded.

<DESC>R14PS94008 BPA Metalwork Material and Supply Services
Combined Synopsis/Solicitation: The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement for the establishment of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for the period of December 1, 2013 through November 30, 2018 for Metalwork materials and supplies.  It is anticipated that multiple BPA awards will be the result of this announcement.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 423510 Metal Service Centers and Other Metal Merchant Wholesalers.  This small business size standard is 100 employees.  This procurement is 100% set-aside for small business.  
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The solicitation document and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-26 (June-2008).  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Solicitation Number for this Request is R14PS4008.
Background: Provo Area Office Force Account (PAOFA, FA) developed during the mid-1990's as an extension of support services for its materials and testing group.  In addition to supporting material and testing services, heavy equipment operators and civil engineering technicians provided valuable and immediate services during emergencies, and necessary repairs and maintenance of Reclamation facilities.
This remains the primary role of FA; however, emergency and repair work is challenging to predict and plan for.  In order to maintain its capabilities, and ensure its existence at times of need, FA began doing repair and rehabilitation work agency-wide, and interagency-wide, within the Reclamation jurisdictional area.
During the mid-2000's Reclamation performed its "Managing for Excellence" (M4E) studies.  Team 11 presented their report of cost comparisons for in-house versus outsourcing.  The concluding scope statement notes, "In today's engineering and construction climate, it is imperative that Reclamation make a concerted effort to collaborate with customers and stakeholders such that our operations are transparent and efficient.  At the same time, Reclamation must take positive steps to maintain our core technical capability in order to remain good stewards over our dams and other facilities."  Thus FA provides a constant presence for emergency demands and maintains some core technical construction capabilities where individual project or facility characteristics and demands may not, due to economic or time constraints, lend themselves to execution and administration through conventional contracting.
Given this role, FA is in consistent, and sometimes unpredictable, need of materials and supplies to accomplish assigned tasks in a timely and efficient manner.  Regularly, during active construction, crews will encounter unplanned modifications to scope, requiring immediate procurement of materials and supplies.  The intent of this BPA is to meet this need by providing construction material and supply needs in all regions FA performs services.
Possible Locations of Service: Force Account provides in-house construction services on Reclamation facilities, and on facilities of other federal agencies.  These services vary widely from embankment dam repair work to wetland mitigation construction efforts.  The location of construction also varies, and may be located anywhere in the 17 western states; however, the preponderance of construction projects fall within two general geographic areas.
North Region: The North Region is defined as the area north of the southern borders of Utah, Colorado, Kansas, and north of 37 degrees latitude in Nevada and California to the southern Canadian border, west to the pacific coast, and east to the eastern borders of Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota.
The primary zone for construction projects is northern Utah and eastern Colorado; however, projects may be completed in any location within the region previously defined.  Following are examples of pertinent project locations that indicate geographic areas FA has completed work - the examples do not, however, represent locations work will be completed, although, on occasion, the construction crew is requested back to previous jobsites: 		 Battlement Mesa Dam III, Parachute, Colorado	Crooked Creek Dam, Eagle, Colorado Crystal Lake Dam, Ouray, Colorado		Cedar View Dam, Neola, Utah Thunder Ranch Levee, Jensen, Utah		Provo River Rehabilitation, Heber, Utah Humbug Pond, Heber, Utah			Fontenelle, Wyoming Ochoco Dam, Oregon			MIAD, Sacramento, California Echo Dam, Utah				Newton Reservoir, Utah Myton, Utah				Trenton Dam, Nebraska Enders Dam, Nebraska			Stamped Dam, Truckee, California Prosser Dam, Truckee, California		Angostura Dam, South Dakota
South Region: The South Region is defined as the area south of the southern borders of Utah, Colorado, Kansas, and South of 37 degrees latitude in Nevada and California to the northern border of Mexico, west to the pacific coast, and east to the eastern borders of Oklahoma and Texas.
The primary zone for construction projects is along the Colorado River Corridor from Las Vegas, Nevada to Yuma, Arizona; however, projects may be completed in any location within the region previously defined.  Following are examples of pertinent project locations that indicate geographic areas PAO FA has completed work - the examples do not, however, represent locations work will be completed, although, on occasion, the construction crew is requested back to previous jobsites: 		 Las Vegas, Nevada				Moapa, Nevada Parker Dam, California/Arizona		Blythe, California Imperial Dam, California/Arizona		Beal Lake, Arizona Needles, California				Chama, New Mexico Flagstaff, Arizona				McClellan Dam, Texas Davis Dam, Nevada/Arizona			Navajo Dam, New Mexico
This BPA will require vendor's ship requested supplies anywhere within the designated geographical area, north or south, to the jobsite associated with the requested supply.  Delivery urgency and acceptable lead times will be a function of market availability, and project requirements communicated at the time a request is made.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ????6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ???Principal,??? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<p>52.204-13 System for Award Management Maintenance (Jul 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to <br />be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued as Request for Quotations (RFQ) NIHLM2013845SRE. The resultant order will be a firm-fixed price purchase order. <br /><br />In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.5, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to procure professional services to continue efforts to strengthen sub-Saharan African medical journal capacity and to promote dissemination of research findings in scientific publications through the African Journal Partnership Project (AJPP). This acquisition is Full and Open. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541611-Administrative Management and General Consulting Services.
<p>Background Information</p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) has been a significant contributor in international health information activities for at least half a century. In recent years, NLM has supported intensive capacity-building projects focused on selected developing countries. In 2004 a partnership was established as a pilot project for the purpose of improving the quality of African medical journals. Known as the African Medical Journal Partnership (AJPP), this capacity-building, was initiated by NLM, the Fogarty International Center, and the following journal partners:</p>
<p>African Health Sciences (AHS - Uganda) with the British Medical Journal<br />Ghana Medical Journal (GMJ) with the Lancet<br />Malawi Medical Journal (MMJ) with the Journal of the American Medical Association<br />Mali Medical (MM) with Environmental Health Perspectives</p>
<p>The initial pilot project, administered by the Council of Science Editors (CSE), an international non-profit, membership organization dedicated to promoting excellence in the communication of scientific information, was conducted from 2004 to 2007 and expanded in 2008 to include two (2) new partnerships:</p>
<p>Ethiopian Journal of Health Sciences (EJHS) with Annals of Internal Medicine<br />Medical Journal of Zambia (MJZ) with New England Journal of Medicine</p>
<p>Since the program's inception, the four (4) original journals have been accepted into MEDLINE and PubMed. EJHS was also recently accepted into MEDLINE. Its inclusion in PubMed Central is pending. OVID Technologies, a journal aggregator and online database provider, has agreed to distribute all six journals, further expanding access to these journals. Additional accomplishments include:</p>
<p>oMore efficient journal processing times and overall journal management due to technical enhancements such as new equipment and software provided to the journals <br />oDramatically increased submission rates and decreased acceptance rates, indicating greater selectivity. <br />oRegular, African editor-initiated, basic and advanced training workshops for authors and reviewers</p>
<p>In 2013, two (2) new African journals were recruited into existing partnerships:</p>
<p>Annales Africaines de M&eacute;decine (Democratic Republic of Congo) was paired with the MM and EHP<br />Sierra Leone Journal of Biomedical Research was paired with AHS and BMJ partnership</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives of the Procurement</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to continue efforts to strengthen sub-Saharan African medical journal capacity, and to promote dissemination of research findings in scientific publications.</p>
<p>NLM's commitment to African journal capacity building is reflected in Recommendation 2.2. of its Long Range Plan 2006-2016.</p>
<p>Recommendation 2.2. Work selectively in developing countries that represent special outreach opportunities, such as improving access to electronic information resources, enhancing local journal publications of high quality, and developing a trained librarian and IT workforce.</p>
<p>Continued effort is required to improve and maintain the gains achieved to date and using the Network of African Medical Librarians (NAML) and other sources to provide further training for editors in the areas of information literacy, statistics, data presentation, data interpretation, manuscript preparation, ethics in research and publication, developing business plans for editors, use of ClinicalTrials.gov; to provide updated computer hardware and software to journal editors; to survey journal activity with readers, authors, and reviewers; and to expand the number of journals as feasible.</p>
<p>Additional efforts will also be required to develop new business models and to cultivate innovative methods, such as social networking, to disseminate scientific information to doctors, students, healthcare workers, researchers, and policy makers.</p>
<p>The Center for Global Health Studies at the Fogarty International Center will support a 10th anniversary retrospective review and a forward-looking visioning process, which will identify overall achievements to date, lessons learned, and future strategic challenges and priorities.</p>

The Agency's Office of Financial Management (OFM) is pursuing a significant modernization of its departmental and agency financial and administrative payment systems in order to address challenges and opportunities in the rapidly changing federal financial management and technology environment. The primary objective of this modernization effort is to improve financial management performance by efficiently providing OFM with a modern, core, financial management system that both complies with federal accounting and systems standards and provides maximum support to the Agency's mission. As part of this effort the OFM will utilize the services of a consultant to conduct a comprehensive analysis of current OFM management information systems, then providing recommendations on various future state solutions.
<p>The Agency anticipates a performance period comprised of a 23-week base period, along with one, one-year option period. Basis of award will be made on a competitive basis utilizing a "trade-off" source selection procedure evaluating: (1) Required&nbsp;Experience Criteria, (2) Technical and Management Approach, (3) Past Perfor-mance, and (4) Cost/Price.</p>
<p>All information required for submission of a proposal is identified in the attached solicitation. The Agency anticipates award on or about December 16, 2013. All interested parties must be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM). SAM can be accessed at www.sam.gov, or by calling 1-888-606-8220. All prospective offerors interested in submitting a proposal must have a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code.</p>

<p>The FRTIB is an independent Federal agency in the Executive Branch created by the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA). The TSP is a retirement savings and investment plan for Federal civilian employees and members of the uni-formed services that offers its participants the same type of savings and tax benefits that many private corporations offer their employees under I.R.C. &sect;401(k) plans. The mission of the FRTIB is to administer the TSP solely in the interest of participants and beneficiaries. The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) informs the Agency's pro-curement activities; however, as a non-appropriated fund Agency, it is not bound by the FAR.</p>
<p>The TSP is the largest participant-directed defined contribution plan in the world. As of August 2013, the TSP had approximately 4.6 million participants, of which an estimated 4% are domiciled overseas, and about $367 billion in assets. The TSP is available only to Federal employees of the civilian service and members of the uniformed services; vested participants may leave their funds in the TSP after they leave service.</p>

The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government.

<p><br />(2) CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY</p>
<p>No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Harrison, MT 59636.  This will be a SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  This is an Engineering Design and Construction Period Services Project. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330.   The NAICS code for this project is 541330- Engineering Services and the size standard is $14.0 million.                                             
Scope of Work
The VA Montana Healthcare System requires the services of a qualified Architect / Engineer (A/E) firm to provide design services to correct energy deficiencies at the VA medical center located in Fort Harrison Montana.  Fort Harrison is operating with severely old and outdated systems. The energy standards 20 years ago were nowhere near the standards today. Most of the equipment and utility systems at Fort Harrison are operating to the point of failure. Their operating parameters are not energy efficient and need to be replaced.
Fort Harrison VAMC recently concluded a Retro-Commissioning Investigation.  The attached report and associated documents from this investigation identifies a number of areas where improvements in energy usage can be recognized.  This report will serve as the basis for the design effort.  The A/E will review this report and make recommendations for focus areas of the design work with the cost/return value as the primary means of determining priority.  Final priorities for design elements will be determined by the VA.  At this time, the VA has identified a few primary items of interest.  These are:
"	Replace remaining pneumatic controls with DDC controls.
"	Insulation of ducts and steam lines as appropriate.
"	Provide redundant cooling for the Pharmacy area and Computer Server room.
"	Retrofitting Constant Volume systems (specifically AC-1) with variable frequency drive and variable air volume boxes.
Extensive phasing of the construction will be necessary to reduce periods of disruption to the extent possible.  The design should clearly indicate phasing and construction durations for the independent phases on a phasing plan having its own dedicated sheet in the drawing set as well as clarification in the general requirements of the specification.
A/E Requirements
The anticipated construction cost associated with this design is expected to range between $800,000 and $1,000,000. The VA expectation is that the A/E will provide sufficient design services to utilize this entire construction budget.  The A/E will provide an initial itemized construction cost estimate as part of the 30% submission from which the VA may choose to modify scope to reflect the anticipated construction budget, limiting design activities only to those items that can be provided within the cost limitations.  This cost estimate shall be carried forward and modified to reflect changes on each subsequent submission.  Design of the previously described systems must meet all applicable codes, regulations, and standards.  This includes but is not limited to NFPA Codes, NEC, EPA, DEQ Regulations, OSHA 1926, and TJC Standards.  Additionally, the A/E is required to meet all applicable laws and regulation not explicitly stated in this document.  Design efforts and products shall be conducted and produced in compliance with VA Publications including Master Construction Specifications, Design Guides, and CAD Standards (http://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL).  Compliance with public law regarding energy utilization is required, therefore selected equipment shall be designated FEMP or ENERGYSTAR compliant and exceed the performance standard specified in ASHRAE 90.1-2004 by 30%.  
A/E submissions are to comply with the requirements stated in PG-18-15 Volume C.  The design submissions shall consist of progressively more complete documents consisting of the following:
"	Schematic Design (30%)
"	Schematic Design (50%)
"	Design Development (90%)
"	Design Development (95%)
"	Construction Documents (100%)
"	Final Construction Documents - Production
Meetings to review the submissions shall be conducted via teleconference if determined to be necessary by the VA.  Physical appearance by the A/E shall be made at the request of the VA and shall serve primarily as a means of involving all stakeholders to address concerns, but shall not exceed three (3) appearances throughout the design phase.  The design shall incorporate phasing during the construction process to minimize impact to operations.  An initial phasing plan shall be proposed and approved by the VA as part of the 50% submission, then be fully incorporated into the design at the Design Development stage.   The final phasing plan shall specifically state work durations by area as separated by lease agreements.  Specifications shall be derived from the VA Master Specifications and provided initially as part of the 90% submittal.  The A/E will provide four sets of documents at each submission with the exception of the 100% submission, which will require only one complete 100% document set and an accompanying independent Cover Sheet stamped "CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS" for VA signatures.  Prior to production of the Construction Documents, all sets shall be stamped as "NOT FOR CONSTRUCTION".  At production of the construction documents, electronic set of drawings in AutoCAD 2010 and specifications in Microsoft Word 2007 shall be provided to the VA in addition to four (4) sets of full sized drawings, four (4) sets of half sized drawings and four (4) sets of specifications for procurement.  To allow for posting, construction drawings shall also be provided electronically in half size (11x17) as PDF files.  A schedule shall be provided by the A/E utilizing Microsoft Project and adhering to the basic schedule noted in this document.  
Existing Site Conditions
The location of work is throughout Building 154, 154A, 150, and 141 on the VA medical Center campus in Fort Harrison Montana.  The expectation of the VA is no asbestos abatement should be necessary for this project; however this assumption is to be validated by the A/E through site investigation.  The VA has limited electronic drawings reflecting existing conditions.  Specifics for all systems that are the subject of design should be site verified by the design team.

<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR:</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State's (DoS), Office of Aviation (INL/A) supports the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affair's (INL) interregional aviation program, playing an important and crucial role in the USG's efforts in waging an aggressive and effective attack against the foreign drug and crime threat. The Office of Aviation supports host governments worldwide in their efforts to locate and eradicate illicit drug crops, interdict illicit drug production and trafficking activities, and develop their own institutional counter-narcotics aviation capabilities.</p>
<p>The Office is responsible for providing the aviation assets, USG contractor services and the personnel to oversee and manage the assistance provided so that the host government can conduct air-supported curtailment of the supply of illegal drugs through eradication of drug crops, interdiction of refining laboratories and trafficking activities, and other enforcement operations as defined by the USG-Host Government bi-lateral agreements. The aviation assets and personnel are managed by the INL Section of the U.S. Embassy in Lima and operate from a Main Operating Base (MOB) in Pucallpa and up to four forward operations bases (FOB) east of the Andes. The INL Section must insure that these assets are adequately protected and utilized in accordance with INL/A Operations Directives. Host nation personnel must be trained and supervised to provide the required base security, support air operations, and perform base upkeep and maintenance.</p>
<p>Purpose: <br />The purpose of this personal service contract position is to provide a Security Field Advisor as required at INL-Section-controlled locations in Peru to advise and coordinate with the U.S. Embassy and host nation personnel in overseeing the security posture of the base and the operations conducted from there.</p>
<p>Relationships: <br />The Security Field Advisor works under the direct supervision of the Field Advisor / Security Supervisor. The Advisor exercises wide latitude for independent action in executing approved programs with limited supervision while in the field.</p>
<p>Duties and responsibilities: <br />1. Manage and supervise INL Section-sponsored/directed activities in support of Peruvian counter narcotics operations.<br />2. Advise on specific matters related to the security of human and material resources at all operational sites. Coordinate with other Embassy elements and host country agencies to assess the threat level at the operational sites to determine and implement appropriate security measures.<br />3. Direct, plan, and coordinate with the Senior Field Security Supervisor/Advisor and Aviation Advisors on decisions regarding the safety and security of U.S. government personnel and property.<br />4. Develop Emergency Action Plans for INL Section facilities in Peru and train the personnel at those facilities in their execution.<br />5.

POC SFC Gloria Garside <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal Criminal Tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have" the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>In accordance with DFARS 252.232-7003, "Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports", the contractor shall submit their payment request electronically using the WAWF. The WAWF website is located at https://wawf.eb.mil. There is no charge to use WAWF.

The Government may or may not hold discussions on technical proposals (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)); therefore, the Offeror's initial proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms from a technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.</p>

<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514<br /><br />TITLE: Multi-INT Enhanced Exploitation and Analysis Tools (E2AT)</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement<br /><br />FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-12-13<br /><br />CFDA Number: 12.800<br /><br />I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />The Information Directorate, Activity Based Analysis Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers through this Multi-INT Enhanced Exploitation and Analysis Tools (E2AT) announcement. E2AT is focused on the improvement of operator-exploited sensor analytical performance for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems like the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) that operate within a Multiple-Intelligence (Multi-INT) environment. The advances made under E2AT will assist in operating under Anti-Access / Area Denial (A2/AD) conditions where limitations can degrade C4ISR capabilities. Multi-INT solutions are to be accomplished through the development of innovative technologies that will assist warfighting teams in target tracking and identification, dynamic information annotation, and achieving a high-level information fusion all-source situation awareness. E2AT development is comprised of two complimentary technical areas (TAs): (TA1) Full-Motion Video Exploitation (FMVE) which is an exploitation enhancement that has a focus on video and text source integration and (TA2) Multi-INT Data Association (MIDA) that has its emphasis on overcoming anticipated Anti-Access / Area Denial (A2/AD) conditions.<br /><br />BACKGROUND<br /><br />Full Motion Video Exploitation (FMVE)<br /><br />The FMV processes that are currently in use require labor-intensive analysis in the control, annotation, and reporting of meaningful content. Current analysis techniques are limited in that they demand the full attention of at least two intelligence analysts tasked to watching video, calling out observations, and transcribing content. The E2AT challenge will be to move beyond this inefficient transcription model toward an effective automated capability. Accessing and incorporating relevant data from other domains can provide application services such as entity and adversary network detection, activity discovery, contextual geo-location, and target identification in order to provide additional support for FMV and other processes that will support comprehensive mission awareness. The exploitation of Image Intelligence (IMINT) sources involves selectively processing track-level data (e.g., from the exploitation ground stations), image and plot-level data (e.g., a report of a high-value individual sighting at a checkpoint), and handling and linking of IMINT data to non-real-time data (e.g., a Human Intelligence (HUMINT) report.<br /><br />Multi-INT Data Association<br /><br />While Non-IMINT sources can significantly enhance FMV capabilities, associations among these sources can also be applied to Anti-Access / Area Denial (A2/AD) situations. The various intelligence sources can be used to extract high-level knowledge (e.g., situation awareness) from low-level processes as inputs for human judgment and assist in the formulation of decisions and actions. The joint multi-INT analysis will provide insight for preparation and assistance during operations about the patterns of life of the neighborhoods and people. Within these localized events, algorithms that discover relationships and anomalies indicative of suspicious behavior can be matched against previously collected IMINT data. While the localized events may each occur over a small spatio-temporal window, the overall threat activity sequence may span a much larger geospatial-temporal window that requires support of multi-INT sources.<br /><br />Advanced knowledge creation capabilities from multi-INT data associations can be used to provide situational awareness for real-time requirements whether involved in sensor rich environments or when sources like FMV are limited or denied (e.g., A2/AD). Multi-INT tools can aid the analyst in discovering and separating pertinent, relevant and novel data from the noisy or worthless content.<br /><br />PCPAD-X<br /><br />The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) PCPAD-X (Planning &amp; Direction, Collection, Processing &amp; Exploitation, Analysis &amp; Production, and Dissemination eXperimentation) initiative is developing an operationally-representative multi-INT environment. PCPAD-X is an innovative approach to research, develop, demonstrate, and conduct objective evaluations that will facilitate the successful technology transition of mission driven solutions. This PCPAD-X initiative brings together the expertise of information technology research with advances from the Information (RI), Sensors (RY), and Human Effectiveness (RH) directorates to demonstrate autonomy and data-to-decisions. The AFRL Automated Processing and Exploitation (APEX) Center is the AFRL/RI gateway into the PCPAD-X environment and has been specifically constructed as a testbed for relevant data processing, providing access to intelligence analysis tools and algorithm testing. The E2AT program will be used as a valuable resource in the validation and verification of emerging FMV and Multi-INT capabilities within the PCPAD-X initiative. It is expected that all deliverables and product developments will be validated and verified in the AFRL PCPAD-X environment.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES<br /><br />E2AT is composed of two technical areas (TAs): TA1 - Full Motion Video Exploitation (FMVE) and TA2 - Multi-INT data association (MIDA) for A2/AD. The E2AT goal is to demonstrate end-to-end combined multi-INT physics-based and human-based annotated products to enable enhanced analyst performance. TA1 focuses on a permissive environment that seeks solutions to physics-based (e.g., exploited video) to human-based (e.g. chat, call-out transcription) annotations for operators. Extending multi-INT association, T2A focuses on human-based (e.g., document content extraction) to physics-based (e.g., standoff radar tracks) associations for analysts supporting an A2/AD environment.<br /><br /><strong>TA 1 - Full-Motion Video Exploitation (FMVE)<br /></strong>The primary focus of FMVE is to provide video-to-text association to enable enhanced annotated video products. Using current imagery exploitation tools such as FMV and Wide Area Motion Imagery, the outputs (e.g., target features and track results) need to be presented in a format for textual association to enable hard (e.g., video) and soft (e.g., text) information fusion. As the operator calls out information in the video, the content must be transcribed in order to enable text extraction. Solutions proposed for the hard (video exploitation) and soft (text extraction) fusion require methods in metadata (e.g., time stamps) development for association, features (e.g., words and pixels) analysis for correlation, and contemporary processing techniques (e.g., track reports) for estimation. The secondary focus is to improve the persistent need to process and generate searchable content through the annotation, tagging, marking, and augmenting Image Intelligence (IMINT) data to better describe video products. Finally, the third focus is on automated interactive approaches between the operator, FMV data streams, and multi-media content to support FMV exploitation, access, annotation, indexing, storage, and linking of IMINT products (e.g. Geographical, moving, signals) to non-IMINT data products (e.g., open source, human, and communications) to enable reasoning (e.g., patterns of life). The three elements of FMVE include developments in (1) video-exploitation associated to text-extraction for annotated video outputs, (2) content-based image and textual retrieval, processing, and dissemination, and (3) interactive visual analytics for advanced operator reasoning.<br /><br />The result of TA1 calls for enhanced solutions to support operator video exploitation. For example, while the human viewer monitors the video feeds to recognize any significant content, their observations must be automatically translated into searchable display content as either textual and/or graphical products. The general FMVE developments would be physics-based (e.g., video) analysis to enable text-based (e.g., transcribed call-outs) hard-soft fusion. The FMVE operational advancements should leverage established technical tools and capabilities, build innovative image-to-analyst annotation functionality, and have a measureable evaluation of performance improvements.<br /><br /><strong>TA 2 - Multi-INT Data Association (MIDA)<br /></strong>The primary focus for the E2AT multi-INT data association is layered opportunistic fusion for strategic mission awareness from human-based (i.e., document) and physics-based (i.e., geographical products, GEO INT) sources to enable operational coordination of both IMINT and non-IMINT based sources. The second focus is to expand the relevant intelligence data set processing that can be incorporated into a DCGS display to exploit stand-off (e.g., radar) and extracted document products. Multi-INT data that exists as text (e.g., intelligence reports, chat), movement (e.g. radar moving target indication), signal or audio-based (e.g. communications transmissions) content should be made readily available to the analyst as supportive information that could be presented on a geospatial-based graphical display. Joint data management solutions are needed to effectively associate Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), Image Intelligence (IMINT), Moving Intelligence (MOVINT), Communications Intelligence (COMINT), Human Intelligence (HUMINT), Signals (SIGINT) Intelligence data and Cyber ISR data. Information sources, whether they are textual, video or audio, are not easily or readily transformed within the context of other data feeds (e.g., SIGINT) for Multi-INT data association. The inability to create associations from the multiple sources can cause critical information or knowledge to be overlooked or ignored. The third focus is to leverage new techniques (e.g., text-extraction, statistical relational learning, discovery algorithms, and contextual and syntactical reasoning) over various INTs to provide real-time situational awareness to the warfighter coupled with a forensic reach-back capability for identifying unknown or latent relationships (e.g. activities, patterns of life) over various operational conditions. The three elements of MIDA include developments for denied environments over (1) feature extraction with respect to both IMINT and non- IMINT analysis, (2) information management analysis over multi-INT sources, and (3) interactive textual/graphical analytics.<br /><br />The result of TA2 requires advanced multi-INT solutions to support analysts who traditionally are focused on text extracted and exploited video products. For example, an analyst must search a plethora of data to identify significant contextual entities; (e.g., hostile forces, critical events, and salient relationships) over multimedia content that are all competing for the analyst's attention amidst an onslaught of irrelevant data. A result of multi-INT availability is that there is just too much information being generated from differing intelligence streams for analysts to holistically view and efficiently and accurately identify the relevant data. There are many unstructured data sources that are not being fully exploited (e.g., narratives) to distill "what matters", identify significant entities and their associations, and characterize anomalies, patterns of life, threats, or alerts. Filtering, correlation, association, and focus provided from other INTs can manage complexity of the various intelligence streams.. The general MIDA developments would be text-based (e.g., documents) extraction to support physics-based (e.g., radar) exploitation to enable soft-hard fusion. The MIDA operational advancements should leverage established technical tools and capabilities, build innovative text-to-analyst understanding, and have a measureable evaluation of performance improvements.<br /><br />II.

REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.<br /><br />3. The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA from multiple offerors.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">The NATO Support Agency (NSPA) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for the provision of portable fire protection equipment.</p>
<p>The equipment to be provided must have been manufactured in a NATO-member country.</p>
<p>Preference will be given to complete bids. Should no satisfactory bids for the complete project be received, partial bids for the entire extinguisher requirement and for the entire maintenance requirement will be considered.</p>
<p>In order to bid on this project, a U.S. prime contractor must 1) maintain a professionally active facility (office, factory, laboratory, etc.) in the United States, 2) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB), and 3) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using IFB-5HQ27010-1X as its reference for the IFB.</p>
<p>PROJECT OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish to NSPA a variety of portable fire extinguishers, re-filling equipment, portable maintenance and storage workshops, and other miscellaneous fire protection equipment in accordance with the requirements in this Statement of Work (SOW). These portable fire extinguishers are intended to provide a first response capability to camp occupants in a rapidly deployable headquarters camp of NATO military forces that may be deployed over a wide range of geographic environments and climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Accordingly, NATO expects the equipment to be robust and of high quality, extremely reliable when needed, easily verified and maintained, and fit for use under difficult climate and terrain conditions. The portable fire extinguishers shall be placed in one of four major camps of 500 occupants each, in one of two remote site camps of 16 occupants each, or in a DARS camp of approximately 70 occupants. Additionally, NSPA is including a request for an additional quantity of optional equipment that may be required later for miscellaneous uses. The acquired equipment shall be stored at the NATO Southern Operational Center (SOC) in Taranto, Italy when not deployed for operations or training and shall be refurbished there, as necessary, between deployments. This equipment shall be:</p>
<p>- Stored in operational or near operational condition in shipping containers, stacked outdoors and at ambient temperatures in SOC, until needed<br />- Configured and loaded quickly for s specific mission<br />- Transported by sea, land, or air including by C-130 aircraft using ISO type shipping containers that are limited in height to 2.438 m in length to 6.058 m, and in weight to 14,000 kg. Those items transported to the Remote Sites or DARS are limited to 6000 kg to facilitate movement by helicopter<br />- Distributed into tents, buildings made from modified shipping containers, or into outdoor fire points with minimal preparation and without having to construct or assemble mounting brackets<br />- Deployed on task for use by soldiers trained in the operation of portable fire extinguishers<br />- Managed, inspected, and maintained by qualified fire response personnel in consideration of a contractor defined maintenance program and using the maintenance equipment requested in this SOW<br />- Deployed in exercises for short periods each year and/or deployed in operations as required<br />- Operated with limited maintenance under harsh field conditions during periods of deployment lasting up to two years<br />- Expected to perform reliable service without any loss of function at any time during deployed exercises or operational periods, assuming that prescribed maintenance has been completed<br />- Dismantled and returned to SOC for refurbishment and storage prior to re-use for a minimum of five operational cycles<br />- Used as a family of fire protection equipment to provide the first response in a highly flammable, largely tented environment that is densely occupied and liable to enemy attack</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list for this procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm</p>

<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. A DOE is used to nominate an approved prime contractor to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>U.S. firms must request a DOE (and, for U.S. firms new to NATO ICB, submit the one-time NATO ICB application) by: 30 October 2013</p>

<DESC>Amendment 1 is issued to correct errors contained in the original presolicitation.  The original presolicitation contained several errors and conflicting information between the FBO presolictation posting and the presolicitation attachment including contact information, close date, and project magnitude.  The correct information for this presolicitation is contained in this Amendment and should solely be used as opposed to any other information contained in the original FBO posting.  Please pay close attention to the proposal due date below.


ARCHITECT-ENGINEERING (A/E) DESIGN SERVICES: The WBJ Dorn VA Medical Center, Columbia, SC is seeking qualified A/E Firms to furnish professional services for four (4) projects.  The VAMC intends to award four (4) separate projects.  Respond to each project on a separate SF330.

Project # 1 - Construct Clinic Addition - Track 3 Clinic Build.  This purpose of this minor construction project is to design and construct a new clinical addition at the Columbia, SC VAMC.  The project will construct a building that will increase the standard of care for our Veteran population. 

The intent of this project is to design and construct a new clinical building to reduce current space constraints for Primary Care and Specialty Medicine.  Location of the facility shall be recommended by the A/E service.  It is anticipated the new construction will result in the addition of 25,000 GSF to the Columbia, SC VAMC campus.  The A/E service will be responsible for determining a space layout and arrangement.  The VA anticipated location is east of Building 106.  The magnitude of the construction project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  Value engineering is encouraged and shall be noted at each design review.  The project will include but is not limited to new construction of a 25,000 GSF clinical addition, HVAC and other utility work, interior finishes, utility coordination and site work.  Design and construction shall adhere to all applicable VA standards and specifications.  Construction may be phased to minimize disruptions to the operations of the Medical Center.

The Certification & Accreditation requirements do not apply, and that a Security Accreditation Package is not required. 

Project # 2 - Upgrade Information Management Closets for Security.  This project is to provide a design that gives adequate direction for the installation of Roof Safety Improvements to the southeast portion of the roof of Building 100 at the William Jennings Bryan Dorn VA Medical Center located in Columbia, SC.  The design will provide Drawings and Specifications containing sufficient detail to direct work to complete the project.  The design will provide Cost Estimates and Progress Schedules for all phases of work and construction tasks.  

Work items will include the renovation of 60 communication closets at the Columbia, SC VAMC to meet Information Management security requirements as outlined in VA Handbook 0730/1.  Closets do not currently have physical barriers from ceiling to deck to prevent "up and over" access.  Primary project work includes the installation of a suitable partition to mitigate security access deficiencies.  Additional work items include the installation of motion detector systems per VA Handbook 0730/1 and any additional security requirements necessary to bring closets into full compliance with applicable VA guidelines and industry standards.  The magnitude of the construction project is between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000.   

The Certification & Accreditation requirements do not apply, and that a Security Accreditation Package is not required.

<p>Number of anticipated awards: 3 - 5</p>
<p>Budget (total costs): Phase I: $200,000 for 9 months; Phase II: $1,500,000 for 2 years.<br />It is strongly suggested that proposals adhere to the above budget amounts and project periods. Proposals with budgets exceeding the above amounts and project periods may not be funded</p>
<p>Summary <br />Radiotherapy is employed in the treatment of over half of all cancer patients. Many of those patients, however, may suffer some adverse effects from this therapy during and/or after treatment. In addition, in approximately half of the patients treated with curative intent, the tumors recur. Enhancing specific tumor killing and minimizing normal tissue damage from radiotherapy would improve tumor control and patient quality of life.</p>
<p>Radiosensitizers are agents that are intended to enhance tumor cell killing while having a minimal effect on normal tissues. Recently, two new radiation sensitization drugs have proven clinically effective: Temozolomide treatment with radiotherapy for glioblastoma and Cetuximab treatment combined with radiation for head and neck squamous cell cancers. A large number of other targeted therapies are possible and although some are currently in varying phases of development, there is significant potential for further development of novel agents. Examples of such targeted molecular therapies include radiation effect enhancers of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage response modifiers, as well as agents that alter chromatin organization, cellular responses, and tumor microenvironment (1). Any agent that acts via multiple mechanisms of action or combinations of agents that act via complementary mechanisms of action may also improve therapeutic gain.</p>
<p>Conventionally, radioprotectors are defined as agents given before radiation exposure to prevent or reduce damage to normal tissues, while mitigators refer to those agents given during or after a patient's prescribed course of radiation therapy to prevent or reduce imminent damage to normal tissues. Both radioprotectors and mitigators are also being developed as potential countermeasures against radiological terrorism and several have shown promise in pre-clinical testing. In order for these to be developed and useful in clinical radiation therapy applications, it is imperative to demonstrate that they do not protect cancer cells.</p>
<p>The importance of developing agents that sensitize tumor cells, protect or mitigate radiation-induced damage in normal tissue, improve survival, quality of life, and palliative care in cancer patients was emphasized in a recent NCI workshop on Advanced Radiation Therapeutics - Radiation Injury Mitigation held on January 25th 2010 (Movsas B, et al. Decreasing the adverse effects of cancer therapy: National Cancer Institute guidance for the clinical development of radiation injury mitigators. Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Jan 15;17(2):222-8. Epub 2010 Nov 3. PMID: 21047979), and in a workshop on Radiation Resistance in Cancer Therapy: Its Molecular Bases and Role of the Microenvironment on its Expression held Sept 1-3, 2010. This contract topic is targeting the clear need of cell-type and tissue-type specific radiomodulators. There is a dearth of radiomodulators available and the projects coming out of this solicitation will drive forward the next generation, and true first generation of radiomodulators. Several SBIR companies have been working in this field and some have partially developed products in response to call for radiation counter-measures (Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (BARDA) and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) funding). The SBIR mechanism is ideal for these businesses to further develop their technology for cancer patients. <br /><br />Project Goals <br /><br />This contract topic aims to encourage discovery and development of innovative and promising radioprotectors, mitigators, or sensitizers that either selectively protect normal tissues (but not tumors) against ionizing radiation or selectively sensitize tumors, thereby increasing the therapeutic ratio of radiation. Proposals for radiation modulators are solicited that include preclinical and/or early phase clinical studies demonstrating safety, efficacy, dose, schedule, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and metabolism. Proposals should also demonstrate a clear understanding of regulatory requirements, and should include a regulatory plan including key steps such as a pre-IND meeting with FDA, submitting an investigational new drug (IND) application, approval of clinical trial design, and ultimately drug registration.</p>
<p>The goal is to stimulate collaborations among small businesses, academic institutions, and contract research organizations to promote the rapid development of innovative radioresponse modifiers that will decrease normal tissue injury and/or enhance tumor killing, thereby improving radiotherapy outcomes. The long-term goal is to enable small businesses to fully develop, license, and/or market radioresponse modifiers for clinical use.</p>
<p>The contract proposal must describe:</p>
<p>Phase I:<br /><br />&bull; A quantitative estimate of the patient population that will benefit from the availability of such radioresponse modifiers.<br />&bull; A plan for generating evidence that the proposed compound(s) protects at least one relevant normal tissue from radiation-induced injury, and/or sensitizes at least two relevant tumor models.<br />&bull; Either: <br />1. A plan for generating evidence that the proposed radioprotector(s)/mitigator(s) does not significantly protect cancer cells, OR <br />2. A plan for generating evidence that the proposed radiosensitizer(s) does not significantly sensitize normal cells and tissues.<br />&bull; The plans must include the methodologies proposed to evaluate the preferential effects on normal tissues or tumors by the compound(s) in vivo (including appropriate biomarkers and endpoints as determined during early interactions with the FDA).<br />&bull; Determination of the optimum dose and schedule in vivo based upon preclinical pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies.<br />&bull; Statistical validation of the proposed study endpoints including where appropriate, power calculations and rationale for proposed sample sizes.<br />Phase II:<br />&bull; The approach to early-phase human trials, as indicated, that are designed taking into account the relevant molecular pathways and targets, and aim to gather pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data to confirm the compound's observed behavior in animal studies. <br />&bull; The approach to assessing the safety and efficacy of the compound(s) in early-phase human trials employing, as appropriate, physician-reported endpoints as well as patient-reported outcomes.</p>
<p>Activities and Expected Deliverables<br />&nbsp;<br />Phase I may include primarily preclinical studies. Phase II or Fast-Track proposals must contain a section entitled "Regulatory Plan" detailing plans for early involvement of the FDA. There should be a description of how the applicant plans on meeting the requirements to: 1) define suitable biomarkers and endpoints, 2) file IND and 3) design and perform phase 0-2 clinical trials in preparation for product transition to phase 3 clinical trials by groups such as the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (http://www.rtog.org/).<br />Where cooperation of other partners is critical for implementation of the proposed methodology, the applicant should provide evidence of such cooperation (through partnering arrangement, letters of support, etc.).</p>
<p>The following deliverables may be required depending on a compound's maturity in the developmental pipeline:</p>
<p>Phase I<br /><br />&bull; High-throughput screening for rapid identification of active compounds, antibodies or genes which modulate a particular biomolecular pathway or pathways involved in radiation response modification <br />&bull; Selection and approval of cell panels for in vitro testing.<br />&bull; Demonstration of drug solubility and uptake using cultured normal and transformed cells.<br />&bull; Study design for determining clonogenic survival or approved alternative tailored to the mechanism of each tested compound.<br />&bull; Clonogenic survival data or approved alternative validating lack of drug toxicity in normal cells, efficacy and specificity of radioprotection for normal cells and/or efficacy and specificity of radiosensitization for tumor cells. <br />&bull; Preliminary evidence for lack of in vivo toxicity in normal cells or organisms.<br />&bull; Documentation providing a top-level description of the protocols and the testing results should be provided to NCI as part of the Phase I progress report.</p>
<p>Phase II<br /><br />For advanced pre-clinical work:<br />&bull; Design of an NCI/Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)-approved in vivo experimentation plan including statistical validation of experimental design/sample size including power calculations. <br />&bull; In addition, selection and approval of tumor cell panel and normal tissues for in vitro testing.<br />&bull; Demonstration of bioavailability PK and PD in rodent model.<br />&bull; For radiation protectors / mitigators: demonstration by physiologic testing and histological assessment that irradiated normal tissues are spared over a 6-month period.<br />&bull; Demonstration of effects (sensitization or lack of protection as appropriate) on tumors using in vivo radiation regrowth delay assays.<br />&bull; Collection of data validating lack of drug toxicity, efficacy, and specificity for normal cells over tumor cells in the case of radiation protectors/mitigators.</p>
<p>Documentation of the testing protocol and testing results should be provided to NCI as part of the Phase II progress report for pre-clinical studies.</p>
<p>For proposals advancing to early phase human trials: <br /><br />&bull; Identify GMP drug source.<br />&bull; Obtain IND approval.<br />&bull; Provide evidence of established clinical collaboration.<br />&bull; Submitted protocol for IRB approval.<br />&bull; Define suitable clinical endpoints and patient-oriented outcomes.</p>
<p>Documentation of the testing protocol and testing results should be provided to NCI as part of the Phase I progress report for pre-clinical studies. <br /><br />Section 12. COMPONENT INSTRUCTIONS AND TECHNICAL TOPIC DESCRIPTIONS, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES, Topic 027, is revised and replaced in its entirety as follows:</p>
<p>027 Oral Formulations for Antibiotics of Public Health Importance</p>
<p>Number of anticipated Phase I awards: 4-6</p>
<p>Fast-Track proposals will not be accepted</p>
<p>Budget (total costs): Phase I: $225,000 for up to 1 year; Phase II: $1,500,000 for up to 3 years</p>
<p>Background: Multidrug-resistant pathogens such as tuberculosis (MDR-TB), gonorrhea and staphylococcus are increasingly challenging to treat. Currently existing drugs for the treatment of MDR TB are only moderately potent, show restrictions with absorption or oral bioavailability, and have toxicity profiles that make patient management difficult. There are two important classes of injectable drugs for TB : the aminoglycosides (amikacin and kanamycin) and the polypeptide capreomycin. Capreomycin is recommended for use in cases of known or suspected resistance to the aminoglycosides and seems to have activity against non-replicating persister bacilli, unlike aminoglycosides. However, it is painful to receive by injection and is associated with severe systemic side effects, including nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Similarly, treatment of drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhea is an escalating public health concern due to the unavailability of oral dosage forms of antibiotics that are efficacious for this infection. Effective treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is also challenging to manage because it requires long-term intravenous administration of vancomycin. Oral formulations of licensed antibiotics to treat these and other bacterial pathogens of public health importance are wanted, particularly to address to the growing incidence of drug resistant infections.</p>
<p>Project goal: The goal of this solicitation is to develop an effective oral dosing formulation or modification of licensed antibiotics that are currently only available as intravenously or parenterally-administered formulations, specifically, capreomycin, meropenem, imepenem or vancomycin. Considerations for formulation may also include mitigation of adverse drug reactions. An example is the formulation of capreomycin for oral administration that maintains efficacy while possibly decreasing adverse events (nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity), for use as part of a drug regimen for the treatment of MDR-TB. A second example is an oral formulation of vancomycin that allows for systemic absorption in order to treat MRSA.</p>
<p>Phase I activities:</p>
<p>&#9679; Development of methodologies to be used to formulate capreomycin, meropenem, imepenem or vancomycin for oral administration<br />&#9679; Development and implementation of a plan for a biological testing component to quantitatively assess the product(s) for: <br />&#9679; In vitro activity in an existing standardized, reproducible, and validated in vitro culture and intracellular test systems, and provide quantitative assessment of efficacy and cytotoxicity of the formulated products(s) and/or <br />&#9679; In vivo efficacy in an existing standardized, reproducible, and validated small animal model of infection which detects statistically valid differences between formulated and non-formulated products for drug efficacy, toxicity and pharmacokinetics</p>
<p>Phase II activities</p>
<p>&#9679; Extended preclinical studies <br />&#9679; Development of a well-defined formulation under good manufacturing practices (GMP) <br />&#9679; Uniformity from lot -to-lot and to be certified under quality control <br />&#9679; Scale-up and production for future Phase I clinical study</p>

<DESC><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The purpose of this action is to upload/post the BAA solicitation itself; the original presolicitation notice is below.&nbsp; The actual due date for Formal Research Proposals is January 29, 2014.<br /><br />____________________________________________________________<br /><br />Presolicitation Notice<br />INTRODUCTION</span></strong></p>
<p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research on the implementation of collaborative care with the goal of eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in access to, and use of, mental health services.</p>
<p>The NIMH, Office for Research on Disparities and Global Mental Health (ORDGMH), plans to issue a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) under the provisions of FAR 35.016 and FAR 6.102(d)(2), to support research on innovative strategies for the implementation, in multiple urban and rural locations, of collaborative care interventions that have shown effectiveness in the reduction of mental health care disparities.</p>
<p>This new BAA initiative will solicit proposals that focus on a single research topic entitled: "TESTING INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COLLABORATIVE CARE FOR MANAGEMENT OF MENTAL DISORDERS AND REDUCTION OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE"</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</span></strong></p>
<p>The specific aims of this initiative are to:<br />1. Develop implementation models that will enable rigorous and sustained delivery of collaborative care for the management of mood and anxiety disorders in individuals ages 18 and older in a range of community service settings found across the United States (e.g. social service organizations, faith-based organizations, human services settings, primary care clinics);</p>
<p>2. Test the feasibility and effectiveness of the implementation model in communities with substantial racial and ethnic minority populations; and</p>
<p>3. Assess the implementation model's overall impact on achieving increased access to and use of indicated mental health care services for racial and ethnic minority populations, compared to implementation as usual.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OVERVIEW</span></strong></p>
<p>This is a Presolicitation Notice in advance of the Request for Proposal (RFP), and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. Solicitation no. BAA-HHS-NIDA(MH)-13-038, detailing the specifics of the project as well as information pertinent to the development of an offeror's proposal, will be available electronically on or about October 10, 2013 and will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities website at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. No paper copies will be available.</p>
<p>This BAA will utilize a 4-step process to include: <br />Step 1 - Technical Dialog <br />Step 2 - White Paper Submission <br />Step 3 - Formal Research Proposals; and <br />Step 4 - Potential Award(s)</p>
<p>This BAA utilizes a multi-step process for organizations contemplating submission of a Formal Research Proposal which allows for an early feedback of the potential NIMH interest in a proposed study, based on technical merit, applicability to the NIMH mission and projected funding. Offerors are strongly encouraged to participate in the Technical Dialog period and to submit White Papers, but this is not required.</p>
<p>The steps will be explained in detail in the RFP.</p>
<p>The BAA RFP will have a section which details the NIMH Research Objectives for this initiative. The RFP will not have a Statement of Work as in a typical research solicitation, and it is the responsibility of the offeror to propose a Statement of Work in the Formal Research Proposal.</p>
<p>The Technical Dialog Period begins with the issuing of the solicitation and closes when White Papers are due. White Paper will be due on or about November 17, 2013, and Formal Research Proposals will be due on or about January 17, 2014. The RFP will specify the exact dates. All communications prior to award of this contract shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one (1) multi-year, cost-reimbursement, completion contract award will be made for a period not-to-exceed five (5) years, beginning on or about July 25, 2014. Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments and for routinely checking the Internet site for any possible solicitation amendments that may be issued by the Government.</p>
<p>The NIMH estimates that the average annual total cost (direct and indirect costs combined) is up to $6 million per year (total up to $30.0 million for 5 years). However, it is anticipated that the total cost for the award may vary depending upon the scope and technical approach to the project. The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research. In no event shall the period of performance proposed by an offeror exceed 5 years.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the NIMH.</p>

<p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) conducts Research and Development (R&amp;D) directed toward Strategic Missions, Special Missions and Electronic Warfare/Information Ops in support of our nation's warfighters. The Strategic Missions area encompasses the full range of DoD activities that alter an adversary's will and ability to attack the United States and it interests, the area's primary technical areas include Threat Detection, Integrated Missile Defense and Global Strike. The Electronic Warfare/Information Ops area supports any military action using electromagnetic energy to control the electromagnetic spectrum or attack an adversary; this area's main focus includes Electronic Attack, Electronic Warfare Support and Electronic Protection. The Special Missions area supports military forces engaged in Special Operations, Irregular Warfare and Riverine Operations, this area's primary technical areas include sensors &amp; communications, mobility &amp; maneuverability, special munitions &amp; weapons, and training. Our mission is to provide Acquisition, Fleet Support, Acquisition Engineering, R&amp;D, Product Engineering, Systems Engineering, Test &amp; Evaluation, Logistics, Maintenance &amp; Repair, Legacy Systems/Products, and Program Management. Within these mission areas the Division is responsible for the full spectrum of R&amp;D, acquisition, and fleet support. Typical functions include fundamental research; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; and development of operational systems. NSWC Crane is interested in receiving proposals for R&amp;D in all of its mission areas. This notice constitutes a combined synopsis/Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). It is intended that this BAA be open for a period of three years from the date of publication. Proposals may be submitted by any non-governmental entity including commercial firms, non-profit organizations, and institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia comprising such concerns. NSWC Crane encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions (HBCUs/MIs). However, no part of this BAA is specifically reserved for HBCUs/MIs. The following guidelines apply to concept papers or proposals. Typically each proposal may be: (1) funded incrementally for periods up to three years subject to the availability of appropriations; (2) funded between $10,000 to $5,000,000, with the size of each dependent upon the topic (although NSWC Crane reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds); (3) more than one effort may be funded for an individual topic area; (4) NSWC Crane is not interested in concepts that already have been developed or proven (even if they never have been sold before); (5) NSWC Crane seeks proposals for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding; and (6) deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation rather than focus on a specific system or hardware solution. Proposals for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and would not be considered for funding. In order to minimize the cost regarding proposal preparation, as a preliminary step, interested parties are strongly encouraged to submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as "white paper"). This white paper should not exceed 10 pages, with an executive summary (short paragraph) on the effort, a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, current Technology Readiness Level (TRL) (see attached APPENDIX 6, TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVELS AND THEIR DEFINITIONS) an anticipated TRL if project is funded, and a rough cost estimate. Offerors should submit the white papers electronically. A title, BAA number, offeror name, project duration, approximate cost, and a brief abstract with information explicitly pertinent to the proposed work must accompany the white paper. The Government reserves the right to request a proposal from any, all, part of, or none of the offerors submitting white papers. Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit full technical and cost proposals on all or part of their white paper submission. However, any such encouragement does not assure a subsequent award. Offerors may submit full technical and cost proposals even if they did not submit a white paper or their white paper was not identified as promising. The Government will acknowledge the receipt of white papers and full technical and cost proposals by e-mail. White papers (and any resulting proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific, technical, and socio-economic merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential naval relevance and contributions of the effort to NSWC Crane's specific mission areas; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to NSWC Crane programs are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered to NSWC Crane with unrestricted (at least Government Purpose) rights; (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or other key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; and (6) Realism/reasonableness of the proposed costs and the availability of funds. These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more important than price. Based on evaluation of the white papers, participants may be selected and invited to submit full technical and cost proposals for evaluation by NSWC Crane using the above noted evaluation criteria. An invitation to submit a full proposal does not guarantee funding. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. For efforts funded as legally binding commitments, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions. This is to notify potential proposers that each grant or cooperative agreement that may be placed under this announcement or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the following clause: "As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents, the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students. If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements, and it may suspend or terminate such grants and agreements unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award." If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any grant, including any existing grant; (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a grant or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation. Any commercial firm or institution of higher education may submit a proposal. There is no longer a requirement that the entity be U.S. in origin. White papers may be submitted any time prior to expiration of the BAA. There is no set date for submission. The following e-mail point of contact is provided for information regarding technical programs/technologies of interest within the warfare areas supported by NSWC Crane and for submission of white papers and proposals: Brooke Pyne (e-mail Crane_TEO@navy.mil). Please refer to BAA number N00164-10-R-0001 in all correspondence and communications.</p>

<DESC>Per FAR part 8.405-6 and FAR part 5.207, order shall be posted to FedBizOpps within 14 days of award. Due to the Government shutdown the post was not able to be submitted on time. Award was made on 9/26/2013.
<p>This requirement was for a contractor to provide FIMS Enhancements in accordance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 9 within the Office of Data Integration and Food Protection (ODIFP). ODIFP, along with The FSIS Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), has developed a system, including a Directive, manual and the web-based software application called the "FSIS Incident Management System (FIMS)" to manage, receive, track, report, and assist in following significant incidents identified by the Agency.</p>
<p>FIMS facilitates FSIS' response to, and management of, significant incidents impacting FSIS regulated products, facilities, and employees. The purpose of FIMS Enhancements is to remedy security flaws in the system by integrating FIMS with the FSIS Security Framework and Policies. ODIFP coordinates FSIS's data collection, analysis, and integration activities across all program areas of the agency.</p>
<p>It was determined through collaboration with both ODIFP and OCIO that due to the Contractor's familiarity with the FIMS system and the critical, time-sensitive and information sensitivity of this project, along with the collaboration of the configuration management processes of the FIMS system, the Contracting Officer determined that the the policies and procedures prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C) would be appropriate for this action.</p>
<p>This requirement would constitute a "logical, follow-on" to the existing FIMS contract no. AG-3A94-D-12-0218, originally competed one year ago on the GSA-E-buy system and awarded to Harmonia Holdings Group.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: September 28, 2013 thru September 27, 2014, This work will be funded solely by FY 2013 Funds.</p>
