<CONTACT>Paul Griffin Contract Specialist 9077863818     paul_griffin@fws.gov;
<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7, Alaska intends to award a sole-source procurement to the State of Alaska, Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G), to gather migratory and other bird and egg harvest information and list the information on a pictorial guide (OMB Survey Form 7-FW-103) for the correct survey periods in 19 communities in the following five project areas: 1) Y-K Delta, Central Kuskokwim: Crooked Creek, Sleetmute, Stony River, Lime Village;  2) Interior, Upper Tanana Villages: Tanacross, Tetlin, Dot Lake, Healy Lake, Tok; 3) Interior, (since 2004); Tanana, Minto, Lake Minchumina; 4) Kodiak Island: Old Harbor, Port Lions, Larsen Bay, Akhiok; 5) Chugach: Port Graham, Tatitlek, Chenega Bay. ADF&G will audit the information gathered for correctness and completeness, and return the information (survey forms) to the U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service, Migratory Birds and State Programs, Alaska Migratory Bird Co-Management Council, with copies to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game Division of Subsistence, Data Management/Analysis. Background: The Alaska Migratory Bird Co-Management Council (AMBCC) consists of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, and representatives of Alaska's indigenous inhabitants.  The AMBCC's primary purpose is to develop recommendations related to the spring/summer subsistence harvest of migratory birds.  Harvest monitoring is a necessary part of this process.  Data gathered through harvest monitoring are used for developing AMBCC recommendations and by ADF&G, U.S Fish and Wildlife Service, and Native organizations within the subsistence eligible areas.  Data are also used by the Pacific Flyway Council; the Arctic Council, Conservation of Flora and Fauna Program; the Circumpolar Seabird Working Group; the National Pacific Seabird Group; the U.S. Geological Survey, Biological Resources Division; and by other scientific and public audiences. In October 2000, the AMBCC appointed a harvest survey technical committee to design a standardized, annual statewide subsistence harvest survey.  In October 2003, the AMBCC approved the technical committee's Recommendations for a Statewide Migratory Bird Subsistence Harvest Survey.  These recommendations include a goal of survey consistency and standardization across regions of Alaska, a statewide administrative structure, and a standardized harvest survey handbook. Contract Purpose: Conduct five harvest survey projects in 19 communities in the subsistence eligible areas of Alaska, according to the Survey Handbook (attached).  Gather information on the nature and extent of bird harvests in each of the seven project areas, outlined under DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITY, below.   This information will be used by AMBCC in developing recommendations for regulations, and by AMBCC's partners: ADF&G, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Native organizations,  in management and protection of the birds.  See Background, above. Contract Objctive: Oversee the  collection of subsistence migratory bird harvest survey information in five  project areas (19 communities total) in the subsistence eligible areas of Alaska.  Audit the information for correctness and completeness.  Return the information (survey forms) to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, Migratory Birds and State Programs, AMBCC, in a timely manner, with copies to the ADF&G Data Management/Analysis Division (see attached Staffing Structure).   Award will be a Firm Fixed-Price contract with a Base Year and two option years.  This announcement is not a request for competitive proposals.  The Government does not intend to accept competitive proposals submitted or received prior to the contract award date of February 25, 2006.  Award will be made 30 days after the posting of this announcement.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) intends to solicit a proposal and negotiate a sole source bridge contract with the Science Application International Corporation (SAIC) for technical and administrative support to the Office of Security and Safety Performance Assurance (SSA).  The proposed bridge contract will provide continuous support to assist SSA meet their mission to develop strategies and policies governing the protection of national security and other critical assets entrusted to the DOE until the follow-on acquisition is completed.  These services are currently being performed by SAIC under Department of Energy Contract Number DE-AM01-00SO20050, which will expire on February 18, 2006.  The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this contract is Section 303[c][1] of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act, 41 USC 253[c][1], and implemented by FAR 6.302-1[a][2][ii][B], which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; and when it is likely that an award to any other source may result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencyâ€™s requirements.  No other firm has the requisite number of key and non-key personnel possessing the required security clearances, technical skill, and training to provide uninterrupted support by February 18, 2006.  As such, this unique working environment necessitates the award of a bridge contract to the incumbent contractor, SAIC.  The intent of this award is to provide the required support services until the award and transition of the follow-on acquisition is completed. The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) Code for this requirement is 541690. The period of performance is for a total of twelve months, including one 6-month base period and two 3-month option periods. .

<DESC>This acquisition is for a firm fixed price, requirements contract consisting of a six-month base period, plus four pre-priced one-year options.  The base period will run from 01 April 2006 to 30 September 2006.  Option Year One is from 1 October 2007 through 30 September 2007.  Option Year Two is from 1 October 2008 through 30 September 2008.  Option Year Three is from 1 October 2009 through 30 September 2009.  Option Year Four is from 1 October 2010 through 30 September 2010.  The applicable NAICS code is 611430 with a corresponding small business size standard (not to exceed) $6,500,000.  Acquisition will be set-aside for small business concerns.  

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES REQUIRED:  Contractor shall furnish all labor, material, equipment, supervision, transportation and management necessary to perform Maintenance Resource Management Training in accordance with the performance work statement.  Services under this contract are required to be performed at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.

Evaluation for award will be Performance-Price Trade-off (PPTO).  Issuance of the solicitation will be on or about 15 February 2006 and will close on or about 16 March 2006.  The solicitation will be available over the Internet only; NO HARD COPIES will be sent.  Follow the links on the EPS website to access the solicitation:  USAF Offices, Air Mobility Command Locations, and 436 CONS, Dover AFB, DE.     Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.  IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS:  Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires that any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contracts shall be submitted in electronic form.  Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system for implementing this statutory requirement.  Use of the basic system is at NO COST to the contractor and training will be provided via the website.  Information available at no cost is located at http://www.wawftraining.com.  As of January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and 
certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or to list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN.  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is designed to help you gather information you need for the resultant clauses/provisions.  The information you provide in your questionnaire is automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  The questionnaire is not your official ORCA submission; the information reflected in your provisions is the version Contracting will review.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; you then acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.  The POC for this acquisition is Lani L. Lowe (302) 677-5028, Fax (302) 677-2309, email: lani.lowe@dover.af.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This announcement is an extension and submission procedures change to Broad Agency Announcement N00024-05-R-6309. All submissions received before this posting date will be evaluated under the procedures originally posted. The Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is available on both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site located at http://www.eps.gov or http://www.fedbizopps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. The Program Executive Office Littoral Mine Warfare - Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Program Office (PMS 403), Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC, is soliciting mature technologies applicable to UUV Systems that are ready for final maturation, integration, or demonstration, and transition into PMS403 programs.     The following are a few examples of key UUV technology areas, however responders are encouraged to address other technology areas as well.  Please be aware amendments adding new technology areas may be added throughout the year.  Note:  This will not change the evaluation process.    Launch and Recovery. Launch and Recovery (L&R) is a key feature of any UUV system, and it is closely related to the vehicle and host platform characteristics.  Particular emphasis is placed on submarine launch and recovery issues with the 21” Heavyweight vehicle class, including submarine flow field and two-body hydrodynamic force characterization. Sensor Integration.  A UUV system combines many sensors, which compete for resources and bandwidth and often require careful timing or tuning to operate optimally together.  Emphasis is placed on integration of acoustic sensors with DVLs and acoustic communications, along with the integration of antenna-mounted ISR sensors. Communications and Networking. Emphasis is on real-time, or near real-time, RF communications of sensor data from a UUV in operational sea states. Autonomy. Open architecture autonomy is needed to support long, complex missions in unpredictable or harsh environments. It includes the need to make independent decisions based on the mission goals, environmental conditions, the on-board sensors, and remaining energy.  Emphasis is placed on autonomy technologies that could be part of a larger decision-making architecture Computer-aided Detection and Classification.  CAD/CAC of targets from UUV sensor data improves capability both for onboard real-time UUV processing and for off board post-processing.  Emphasis is placed on performance in difficult or harsh environments. Energy.  A high-capacity rechargeable UUV energy source is needed to increase UUV endurance and create a more attractive alternative to primary batteries.  Emphasis is placed on addressing shipboard integration concerns. As illustrated in the Navy’s recently updated UUV Master Plan, there are four classes of UUVs.  The planned transition path for these BAA products is the Heavyweight class (21”) Mission Reconfigurable UUV System (MRUUVS). This BAA will be open for one year from the date of the announcement. Proposals may be submitted at any time within that period.  Contracts may be awarded, as appropriate, and will be limited by funding availability.  Please continue to pay attention.  Proposals to this BAA will be reviewed using a two-step process.  First, respondents are asked to submit a brief white paper outlining their ideas for technical review and discussions and to provide a ROM cost and schedule.  The evaluation criteria for the first step will be transition potential to 403 programs [both meeting near-term needs as well as identified gaps] and cost.  A scale of 1 to 5 will be used.  White papers rated 5 directly transition to 403 programs, meet technical shortfalls, and are within the allocated budget.  A rating of one means the technology would not transition to 403 programs in the near term, does not meet any identified need, and is above the allocated budget.   Mature technology (including factors such as safety, reliability, modularity, and security) and use of an open systems approach are important characteristics of transitionable technology. Responses that are rated 4 or 5 will be invited to submit a step-two proposal following the guidelines listed below.  Responses rated lower will be rejected and referred to the technical point of contact for informal discussions on how the white paper may be made more transistionable to 403 programs.   Once a full proposal is received, evaluations will be based on the criteria list below.  This will be the final review process before proposals are selected for contract award.   White papers and subsequent full proposals should be submitted to: COMMANDER, Naval Sea Systems Command, ATTN: Code 02635, Cara Spiro, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue, S.E., Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC 20376, e-mail cara.spiro@navy.mil. This synopsis constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) per FAR 6.102(d)(2)(i); there will be no formal request for proposals (RFP) or other solicitation in regard to this announcement. Because both the technical and cost aspects of an offeror's step-one or step-two submission will be evaluated at the same time, it is desirable that one volume containing all information be submitted. In presenting the proposal material, prospective offerors are advised that quality of the information is significantly more important than the quantity. Therefore, offerors are requested to confine their submissions to essential matters, providing sufficient information to define their offer and establish an adequate basis for the Government to conduct its ev!  aluation. Offerors may submit their proposals (two paper copies and five electronic copies on CD using Microsoft Office 2000 or earlier).  Respondents must be able to certify that they have an appropriate facility clearance to meet the security requirements of work proposed at the time of proposal submission, and key personnel must be certified as holding an appropriate clearance, at the time of proposal submission.  Proposals shall consist of one volume consisting of the technical proposal, management approach, and cost. The technical proposal is limited to 20 pages exclusive of the Statement of Work (paragraph (7), below) and cost information, which has no page limit. Pages are to be 8.5 x 11 inch, single-sided. Minimum font is 10 point. Succinct proposals are desired.   The technical portion shall consist of the following sections, each starting on a new page:  (1) A cover page, including proposal title, technical and administrative points-of-contact along with the telephone and facsimile numbers, followed by a letter signed by the authorized officer specifying the proposal validity period (at least 120 days); (2) An Executive Overview of the proposed technologies and/or concepts as well as any innovative claims for the proposed research, and how they will contribute to and support the objectives of a technology evaluation and demonstration; (3) A detailed technical proposal of the primary precepts of the concept with appropriate elaboration as to the ingenuity associated with the concept. This section shall not exceed 10 pages. (4) A summary of the deliverables including data associated with the proposed research. (5) A summary of the schedule and milestones for the proposed effort that can be traced to the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). !  (6) A one-page WBS. (7) A succinct Statement of Work clearly detailing the scope and objectives of the work and, if any, specific contractor requirements. The statement of work should only document the specific work to be performed as discussed in item 3 above. Any disclosure of information as relating to the merits of the concept included in the Statement of Work but not included in the detailed technical proposal required by paragraph (3) above will not be considered for award selection. If any portion of the proposed effort is predicated upon the use of Government-owned resources of any type, the contractor shall clearly identify: the resources required, the date the resource is required, the duration of the requirement, the source from which the resource may be acquired, if known, and the impact on the effort if the resource is not provided. (8) A description of the results, products, and transferable technology expected from the contract. This section should specifical!  ly address any intellectual property or organizational proprietary cla ims associated with the outcome of this effort. (9) A brief discussion of past performance detailing previous accomplishments and work in this or closely related research areas, previous cost and schedule performance, and the qualifications of the previous key personnel. (10) A brief discussion of the overall approach to the management of this effort, including brief discussions of total organization, use of personnel and their qualifications, project/function/subcontractor relationships, security clearances for personnel and facility, technology transition plans, government interfaces, and planning, scheduling, and control practices. At a minimum the cost portion shall include a cost summary, and a detailed breakdown of cost by WBS element by month for the effort. The selection of proposals for contract award will be based on a scientific review of proposals submitted in response to each BAA. The major purpose of the evaluation will be to determine the relative merit of the technical approach of each proposal and its contribution to the near-term goals of the MRUUVS heavyweight program. Developments that are applicable to other classes will be duly evaluated and considered, however funding priority remains with the near-term PMS403 programs of record.  . Business and contractual aspects, including proposed cost and cost realism, will also be considered as part of the evaluation. Selection of proposals for award will be based on the potential benefits to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of funds. Specific evaluation criteria are as follows:  (1)Degree to which solutions to technical issues important to PMS403 programs are proposed, their feasibility, and the offeror's understanding of the proposed approach and technical objectives. It is desirable that the developments be structured in phases to allow assessment and/or decision points, where allowable;  (2)The offeror's ability to implement the proposed approach as demonstrated by specific accomplishments in the technical field to be studied, the qualifications (including past performance) of the proposed principal investigator and other personnel, and the availability of appropriate facilities and clearances;  (3)The degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed contract are to be delivered to NAVSEA with rights compatible with NAVSEA research and development objectives; and (4)The extent to which offerors identify and commit to small businesses and to small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, women-owned small businesses, historically black colleges and universities, or other minority institution participation in the proposed effort, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor relationship.  THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR AWARD ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED.

<DESC>Sources Sought AFTAC Seismic Analysis and Reporting Capabilities - 2 (SARC-2) The Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC) has a requirement for Seismic Analysis and Reporting Capabilities -2 (SARC-2) to research and develop software for geophysical data processing.  Effort also includes the sustainment and installation of software for analysis and evaluation of geophysical events at seismic array stations around the world.  Additionally, contractor may be required to provide software training to host-country personnel.  Description Analysis and reporting of small magnitude seismic events continues to be one of the most important tasks for the United States National Data Center (USNDC) and the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC).  The operational software system used for analyzing and reporting events in the USNDC is not sufficiently flexible to allow the quick introduction of numerous advanced data processing techniques and the use of various cutting-edge information-presentation technologies.  Lessons learned from several previous special events show that a few key software programs used by the Research Division (TTR) geophysicist are most useful for detailed analyses of small events, and that a user-friendly interface to a specialized reporting database would streamline AFTAC' s reporting process.  The first objective of this project is to build a suite of software for the analysis and evaluation of geophysical events.  Many of the desired analysis and evaluation techniques have already been incorporated into a research software suite known as Special Event Analysis Tools (SEAtools), developed for the TTR under previous contracts.  This software suite shall be the starting point for this effort.  As part of this effort, new analysis techniques shall be added as they are identified.  In addition, the Contractor shall help identify which portions of SEAtools will eventually have to be "operationalized" in the sense of streamlining and configuring it for optimal routine use with vetted operational settings and previously user-specified input parameters.  In addition to the development of new functionality, included under this objective is the evaluation of Government Off-the Shelf (GOTS) and Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) algorithms/techniques, as applicable, for the improvement of geophysical data processing capabilities.  The second objective is to continue the development and maintenance of an event reporting tool that will extract information from AFTAC databases, and use such information to generate graphic and alphanumeric event summaries for presentation to AFTAC's various customers via a web-page hosted on a classified internet Wide-Area-Network.  The third objective is to provide for installation of the SARC software suite at seismic array stations around the world for use in analyzing and evaluating geophysical events. The fourth objective is to provide for maintenance of the software suite.  The contractor shall be responsible for traveling to foreign seismic array stations to install the SARC software and to train the host-country personnel how to use the software.  Contractor personnel will require DoD security clearances at least at the TOP SECRET/SCI level for key personnel.  Handling of material up to a TOP SECRET/SCI is required.  TOP SECRET Facility Clearance is required.  Storage Clearances of at least the SECRET level are required.  The contractor shall possess an in-depth understanding of the requirements listed above.  Ideal contractor candidates must have personnel with knowledge of Seismic Analysis and Reporting Capabilities (SARC) to research and develop software for geophysical data processing.  Contractor experience and past performance are critical to a successful and uninterrupted SARC mission; therefore, a history of relevant work is required.  Experience in assessment and development of concept requirements and operational documentation is required.  Also, experience in performing software validation and testing in above AFTAC/TT mission area outlined above is required.  Capabilities Package This sources sought synopsis is an invitation for all qualified small business sources that contemplate submitting a proposal under a future RFP for this requirement to identify themselves.  Sources should submit a brief capabilities statement in response to this notice.  Responses must be limited to no more than 20 pages and should address the following specific areas: 1. The clearance level of personnel working on the proposed contract; 2. The capabilities of key personnel relating to the requirements outlined above.  Resumes may be included but shall be counted as part of the above page limit. 3. Recent and Relevant company experience and capabilities related to the requirements outlined above. 4. Business size/status.  The government intends to make a single award and trade off performance over price.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract is contemplated with a 1-year base period and 4 one-year options (1 Oct 2006 - 30 Sep 2011).  This sources sought is for planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to pay for information requested, issue a solicitation, or award a contract.

<SUBJECT>R -- Cost Library/Repository
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-CLR-01
<RESPDATE>013106
<CONTACT>Sheila Johnson, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-377-3901, Fax 202-275-0912, Email sheila.johnson@ed.gov
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI): The U.S. Department of Education (ED), Federal Student Aid, Enterprise Performance Management Service (EMPS), Acquisition Planning and Contracts Management Group (APCMG), is conducting market research  to solicit information from industry regarding technical solution and implementation alternatives for an enterprise-wide acquisitions cost library/repository.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of Federal Student Aid to acquire any products and/or services.  FSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI nor pay for the information provided.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of submission of responses to the RFI and Federal Student Aids’s use of such information.

In order to successfully stand-up it's contracting activity as directed by the Secretary's delegation to the Chief Operating Officer on April 1, 2005, Federal Student Aid must execute and/or support, annually, various activities necessary to evolve an acquisition function that delivers continuously increasing value (return on investment) to the organization.  This effort is the next step in providing established standardized processes for the collection of cost data, and an electronic means to catalogue and store cost data, and a standardized structure and process to retrieve cost data for use in cost estimates.  The effort might occur in one or more phases and would involve:

*  Implementation of a cost repository as an interim means to collect and organize cost data that the organization either currently possesses (in hardcopy and softcopy) or will obtain in the future,

*  Establishment of an enterprise-wide work breakdown structure or incorporation of an established enterprise-wide work breakdown structure,

*  Establishment of processes and procedures for the collection of costs and the estimating of future costs,

*  Feasibility study of integrating the cost library with activity-based cost accounting, and

*  Establishment of a cost library database, or its like, that has the capability to categorize and store information in a structure and format that easily facilitates cost research and estimating.

Federal Student Aid lacks credible cost data on which to estimate future costs.  This often results in paying higher prices or, worse yet, the acquisition of a service or product based on a cost/benefit analysis whose benefits are overstated due to incomplete, inaccurate, and/or obsolete data.  A cost library will mitigate the occurrence of such by providing accurate, reliable quantitative and qualitative data to help in the type of short and long-range forecasting required to achieve continuous improvement on return on investment.

Federal Student Aid's vision is that a cost library/repository might include the information listed below.  This listing is not to be considered inclusive or exclusive of any component that might otherwise comprise a cost library/repository.  In fact, Federal Student Aid invites vendors to provide information concerning the best business practices with respect to the establishment, implementation, use, and maintenance of a cost library/repository:

*  Overview and objectives of cost library, including user documentation

*  Methodologies
-  Inputs => work products => outputs  (workflow)

RFI submissions shall not exceed 15 pages (text, graphic, tables, etc.) and shall address each of the following elements separately: 

1.  Present a high-level technical and management approach, including Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and non-COTS product(s), for the new cost library/repository.  Describe how and why these product(s) would be customized to meet Federal Student Aid's business needs. 

2.  If COTS product(s) are not recommended, explain why. 

3.  Provide examples of projects similar in nature that your company has delivered.  Include how hardcopy and/or legacy system data was transitioned/converted for use in the new system. Also, provide the name of the customer (company/organization), customer point of contact, point of contact's phone number, and email address.  FSA may contact these customers to discuss lessons learned. 

4.  What commercial and/or government practices and trends could be relevant and successfully applied to a cost library/repository?

5.  What commercial and/or government Risk Management trends could be relevant and successfully applied to cost  library/repository?

6.  Provide an estimated cost associated with all COTS license(s).

7.  Discuss the feasibility, merits, and cost implications of populating a cost library with cost data currently contained in hardcopy files within Federal Student Aid's files vis-a-vis implementing a "point-forward" approach for populating a cost library/repository. 

8.  Provide FTE estimates, resource experience levels, and costs (including hardware) to design, develop, and implement the new cost library/repository.  Include typical labor resources required to research, retrieve, sort, assemble, and scan hardcopy cost data.

9.  Provide schedule/timeline information, including major milestone activities, required to accomplish the goals of establishing a cost library/repository.

10.  Recommend the type of information your company would like to see in the Request for Proposal's Statement of Objectives and Requirements Document that would allow your organization to effectively scope and price the effort.

11.  Provide your business size and any additional company information that you have determined is relevant.

The government instructs that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this RFI.  However, responses to this RFI that indicate that the information therein is proprietary will be properly safeguarded for Government use only.  Industry is advised that Government support contractors will review non-proprietary information.

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps (USMC) seeks to obtain market research information from sources capable of fully satisfying a line mine clearing and proofing system.  The USMC proposes to evaluate, for near term lease or purchase, acceptable land mine clearance and proofing systems.  To accomplish this goal, the USMC has directed an Analysis of Alternatives study to be completed by a Government and Contractor Support Team led by the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Florida.  The study will assess the ability of candidate systems to perform the following: 1) Clearance of beach lanes and landing areas during amphibious assault operations; 2) Rapid airport runway clearance  (mines and unexploded ordnance); 3) Route clearance of improved and unimproved roads; 4) Area clearance; 5) Clearance of helicopter and/or vertical takeoff and landing aircraft landing zone; and 6) Proofing of cleared areas and routes. All interested parties who would like to include its mine clearance and proofing system in the USMC’s analysis must complete and return the attached System Questionnaire relating to the prioritized system criteria to Beverly Williams via email at bevrly.j.williams@usmc.mil by 30 January 2006. Please include any brochures, test reports, assessments, or other documentation that will best illustrate your system’s capabilities. All material will be forwarded to the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City for review.  Please ensure the completed questionnaire contains UNCLASSIFIED information only.  Your response will be fully protected and treated as proprietary, and will only be used to support the analysis. Information will be returned upon request.   This market research announcement should not be considered a commitment of any kind by the Government and individual correspondence should notbe expected in advance of any resulting pre-solicitation notice for the proposed requirements.  There will not be a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) or any other solicitation issued in support of this analysis of alternatives.  This request should not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award; the U.S. Government is not bound to make any awards or purchases under this request.  Submission of system information does not assure the company of a subsequent award.  NOTE:  If you are unable to retrieve the System Questionnaire, please email me at the above email address.  All technical questions must be sent via email.  If general questions, please feel free to contact me 703-784-0614.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center-Panama City, Florida  (NSWC-PC) is interested in working with a manufacturing company under a Cooperative Research And Development Agreement (CRADA), or other flexible joint-development agreement, to complete the production design of the High Altitude/High Opening Parachutist Navigation System (HAHO-PNS), and have the manufacturer produce 2,000 systems. Military personnel conducting in-air parachute navigation during HAHO parachute insertion missions would use the completed production systems.  NSWC-PC has produced a number of prototype helmet-mounted HAHO-PNS systems inclusive of custom-written embedded navigation software. The prototypes comprise a conformal navigation pod attached to the helmet, and small micro display and optic attached to the goggle. They have undergone extensive testing and evaluation by military Special Forces personnel. The US Navy holds a patent titled, “HELMET-MOUNTED PARACHUTIST NAVIGATION SYSTEM” (# 6,934,63!  3), issued August 23, 2005 on the system. NSWC-PC is seeking interested firms with the technical experience and capability to work closely with NSWC-PC to complete a production design of the HAHO-PNS and manufacture the resultant military systems.  Candidate firms should have experience in the design, integration, and fabrication of integrated electronic systems, miniature electronic components, microprocessors, Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) GPS systems, micro displays, and optical systems. Also, experience and ability to design and manufacture electronic devices for use in rugged military environments (temperature extremes, humidity, rain, salt, sand, high shock and vibration, etc.). Since the HAHO-PNS is a military system, the candidate firm must be a currently approved facility for handling and working with SAASM GPS systems.  Interested firms shall respond with brief documentation showing the company’s ability to fulfill the requirements described above. Only prime contractors should respond. A list of responding prime contractors will be furnished to potential subcontractors upon request. The point of contact for this action is Mr. Dennis Gallagher, Code S13, NSWC-PC, 110 Vernon Ave, Panama City, Florida 32407, PH (850) 235-5417, FAX (850) 234-4671, E-mail: Dennis.G.Gallagher@navy.mil . FSC: 1670, NAICS: 334511, Standard Business Size: 750 employees. Responses to this sources sought should be sent to Mr. Dennis Gallagher at the address stated above not later than 24 February 2006. This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. In the event a solicitation is developed, it will be assigned a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) number and the announcement will be published on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO!  ), Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), and NSWC-PC Internet.

3.	Include proof of bonding capacity in excess of $30 Million.

4.	Provide proof of SBA certification for either 8a or HubZone status. 

The Capabilities Statement for this sources sought is not expected to be a proposal, but rather short statements regarding the company’s ability to demonstrate existing-or-developed expertise and experience in relation to the areas specified herein.  Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the Capabilities statement. Submission of Capabilities statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Navy in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities. This market survey is for information and planning purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. After completing its analysis, the Government will determine whether to limit competition among 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran, or HubZone small business firms or to proceed with issuing an unrestricted solicitation, inviting full and open competition.

Agencies must select products and tools that ensure interoperability, allow for efficient maintenance, and provide adequate performance and functionality. To accomplish these tasks, an agency must set criteria, establish laboratories and test environments, evaluate products and technologies, and finally select from these products and technologies to maximize the value to the agency. Because direct and considerable financial benefits can result from selection via this process, it must be managed and conducted in a manner assuring there is no vested interest in the outcome and which possesses known expertise in the field. The decision of which electronic mail system an agency should adopt, for instance, should be supported by unbiased, technical evaluation of alternatives.  The contractor will conduct, as required by the government, data collections and quantitative analysis, evaluations, simulations, etc. 2.4. Systems and Services Acquisitions: The contractor shall perform analyses and research for government agencies in support of the acquisition of technology and services, biotechnology systems, energy systems, telecommunications and networking systems. This effort includes specifying, prototyping, modeling, demonstrating, and managing technology systems and related services. It requires the support of technical area experts with reputations and credentials of the highest caliber with extensive previous experience in the acquisition life cycle. It also requires developing models and estimates linking cost, system capability, and mission value to assist agencies in selecting the best combination of systems and services for their missions; developing specifications as input to solicitation documents; reviewing and evaluating industry proposals and performance to ensure that high-quality systems and services are delivered.  Evaluations and recommendations must be defensible and totally free of bias or conflict of interest. This high level of independence, objectivity, and expertise is integral to the government in avoiding unnecessary delays, criticism, and potential litigation. 2.5. Independent Validation and Verification: The contractor shall assist government agencies by ensuring, through independent review and testing, the technical quality of systems and products delivered to government agencies.  Many aspects of systems development are complex and sensitive to error. Government systems often perform critical mission or information-processing functions where failure could result in economic loss, reduced quality of life, or even loss of life. These technical evaluations should be made in a manner respected for its technical expertise and independence to minimize undue criticism and delay of critical systems developments. 2.6. Assistance to System Users: The contractor shall support government agencies in planning for and transition to the use of new, updated, and modified systems and related programs. With the rapid pace of change in technology and user requirements, such transitions are to be continually expected. This support includes assisting in the definition of requirements, establishing a system concept of operations, conducting trade studies and technology assessments, and developing user documentation. Decisions made in this role not only determine the ultimate effectiveness of technology initiatives, but they can also give great advantage to one technology or product over another. Advice to government users should be provided in a manner reflecting a broad knowledge of government operations, high-level technical capabilities, and complete freedom from conflict of interest. 2.7. Scientific Applications: The contractor shall assist government agencies to meet existing or emerging challenges, such as, but not limited to, chemical/biological defense, public health and safety, environmental, computer and network security, energy and resources management, operations other than war, law enforcement, counter-terrorism, etc.  The contractor must provide facilities and staff with advanced degrees and extensive experience in the areas listed herein and other related areas.  The contractor must have the technical and management skills to formulate effective solutions to these challenges by helping to translate scientific knowledge into practical skills.  Because results of the work can sometimes impact the welfare of individual companies and entire industries, the Contractor must assure objectivity on the work performed.  The Contractor shall be impartial, unbiased, independent, and be above reproach. 2.7.1. The contractor shall assist agencies with determining how to better anticipate, prepare for, and respond to existing or newly emerging requirements. The capability to effectively evaluate and guide business processes and technology development in these areas on behalf of our customers is essential. 2.7.2. The contractor shall assist agencies in carrying out programs to protect the health and safety of the public and of government employees. The capability to assess risk, ensure quality control, and evaluate design options in support of government responsibilities related, but not limited to, the delivery of health care services, the safety of our food supply, and the safe operation of chemical and industrial processes is critical. 2.7.3. The contractor shall assist agencies with addressing both environmental compliance and environmental security responsibilities and concerns. 2.7.4. The contractor shall assist agencies with protecting and enhancing the efficiency of energy resources. The areas of support include, but are not limited to biology; microbiology; chemistry; toxicology; environmental health; chemical, mechanical, and nuclear engineering; fluid dynamics; physics; hydrogeology; biostatistics; environmental monitoring and remediation; risk analysis, informatics, electrical engineering, transportation engineering, physics, computer science, mathematics, operations research, simulation and modeling.  - END OF PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT -

STATEMENT OF WORK:
Indications & Warning (I&W) Center Training/Exercise Program

NONPERSONAL SERVICES:  The Contractor shall provide all labor, expertise, training materials, travel, etc., necessary to develop and implement a multi-discipline, computer-based intelligence training and exercise program.  The Joint Analysis Center (JAC) operates an I&W fusion center (Operational Intelligence Center or OIC) for U.S. European Command, supporting deployed U.S., allied and coalition forces.  This training will be centered upon and provided to four teams of approximately twelve (12) military and civilian personnel, on a rotating basis as watch positions turnover.  This number may be expanded as operational conditions dictate.  Most trainees will have very limited USEUCOM experience, and many will have limited experience with I&W intelligence analysis or the presentation of I&W analysis to senior executives.

·	The training location is Joint Analysis Center, Bldg 100 (Room 203) and Bldg 314 (Room 11), RAF Molesworth, UK.
·	The Contractor will utilize JAC/DOO/OIC standard operating procedures (SOP).  Working with the DOO Division Chief and the OIC Branch Chief, the Contractor will refine, develop, update and maintain the SOPs as living, on-line documents.
·	The Contractor shall develop a 4-phase training program culminating in ten (10) progressively more challenging I&W and tactical situation (TACSIT) scenarios to reinforce learning objectives and evaluate individual and team performance.


Phase 1 – Basic Skills/Competencies
·	Classification Markings
·	Foreign Disclosure
·	Telecommunication systems and procedures (e.g., VTC room camera/audio, STU/STE, DRSN, NSTS, Tandberg, European Tributary Net (ETN), Watch Center Knowledge Wall)
·	Record message handling/drafting/transmission
·	National and DoD Intelligence organizations and capacities

Phase 2 – Theater-specific Knowledge 
·	Geography
·	On-going conflicts, operations, International organizations, and potentially hostile groups in the Area of Responsibility (AOR) and Area of Interest (AOI)
·	USEUCOM & Component organizational structure and relationships
·	Communication systems architecture including use of Blogs (Web log), CIE Portal, Internet Relay Chat (IRC).
·	Intelligence Surveillance Recon (ISR) Methods & Capabilities

Phase 3 – Watch procedures and techniques
·	JAC organizational structure, SOPs and watch officer responsibilities
·	Command Staff Duty Officer tasks including Emergency Action procedures 
·	Support to Joint Control Board, European Plans & Operations Center and SHAPE
·	Common Operational Picture (COP) and Theater Intelligence Picture (TIP) requirements
·	I&W reporting methodology and procedures 
·	Continuity of Operations (COOP) plans and procedures

	 
Phase 4 – Practical Exercises.  A series of ten progressively more demanding “practicals” will test fundamental watchstanding skills, challenge watch team decision making, and stress the team’s ability to direct intelligence operations under time-sensitive conditions.  In addition to validating individual and team performance, the results of these exercises will be used to refine and develop the OIC’s SOPs and TTPs.  Therefore, they must be easily modified and readily adaptable to changing training requirements.

The practical exercises will revolve around simulated events, incidents or international crises that may occur within the AOR/AOI.  Examples include a coup d’etat, an armed incursion by one country into another, personnel recovery (PR) operations, missile launches, anti-American civil unrest, imminent threat/force protection warning (e.g., Blue Dart procedures), and direct support to NATO/Coalition/allied operations.

Under the direction of OIC Chief and Branch Chief, the contractor will develop narratives and other training materials that support realistic scenarios and facilitate evaluation of performance in specified skill areas (e.g., drafting and disseminating written and oral reports, executing COOP plans, managing COP/TIP inputs).  In addition to specific functional watch skills, the exercises will reinforce a broad understanding of national and theater operational intelligence capabilities and capacities, including those of collection and dissemination systems.  A specific goal of these practical exercises will be to stimulate prompt and active management of intelligence collection processes and procedures (e.g., assessing the current collection posture, directing actions to enhance collection results).  Specific training objectives and scenarios will be developed in conjunction with and approved by OIC Chief before detailed work proceeds.

The specific computer-based methodology for developing, conveying and presenting this training will be the responsibility of the Contractor.  A variety of formats may be employed, provided they help demonstrate the intricacies of the all-source intelligence fusion process while simultaneously conveying distinct lessons learned applicable to OIC watch center conditions.  The Contractor shall ensure that the master CD is provided to the JAC/SSO at least two (2) calendar weeks prior to the training for evaluation.  (The Contractor shall advise JAC SSO and RJTIF when shipped.)  CDs shall be HTML based and only contain data, no applications.  The JAC/RJITF will ensure that the appropriate number of copies of the CD are made and provided to OIC Chief prior to scheduled on-site training. The Contractor shall notify the OIC Branch Chief and JAC/RJTIF if it proposes to run any applications other than an HTML type browser.

The Contractor shall have a TS/SCI clearance and be eligible for specified SCI accesses to perform this service.

It is envisioned that the contractor would visit the JAC four times annually to provide training, discuss any classified issues with the DOO Division Chief, etc.  

The Contractor shall be responsible for all travel arrangements.  

JAC/DOO Project Officer will be responsible for accepting contractor services and providing receiving reports after completion of work and providing contractor evaluation feedback to the Contracting Officer upon completion of training.

<CONTACT>David Paveglio, Contracts Administrator, Phone 631-344-8461, Fax 631-344-5499, Email dpavegli@bnl.gov
<DESC>This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP) for 300kv Ultrahigh Vacuum In-Situ Transmission Electron Microscope designed to provide an optimum combination of in-situ capabilities for high-resolution imaging, diffraction, and spectroscopy (energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and/or spectroscopy imaging) in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environment.   Under this RFP Brookhaven Science Associates (BSA), operator of the Department of Energy’s Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), will award a firm fixed price contract for a 300kv Ultrahigh Vacuum In-Situ Transmission Electron Microscope. 
 
Special requirements include observing chemical reaction of nanometric particles in the TEM with a wide range of temperature and gas pressure for catalysis study.  Thus, a design for the TEM with cutting-edge technology in differential pumping to achieve the required ultrahigh vacuum, while enabling to inject a high gas pressure for observing chemical reactions in-situ is the key to the success of the proposal. 

The transmission electron microscope shall be a side-entry high resolution instrument with nano-probe analytical capabilities.  It shall offer the highest quality of the combined accomplishment on atomic-imaging point-to-point resolution (0.18nm), energy-spread (<0.7eV), and specimen tilt-angle (±45º) available with today’s technology.   The standard performance of the microscope shall meet the published specifications of the manufacturer, including but not limited to the salient features specified in the following specifications         

The instrument shall be delivered to the new building of the Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN) at BNL by June 30, 2007.  The Seller shall test the microscope with BNL employee(s) at the factory before shipment.  The Seller shall demonstrate that the instrument meets specifications after the installation procedure is completed at BNL.   Installation and acceptance tests shall be completed within five months after delivery.  

This, acquisition, is a, “Best Value”, procurement.  The utilization of this procedure is expected to provide the greatest overall benefit to BSA/BNL.  “Best Value” employs a trade off process that permits award to other than the lowest priced offeror or to the highest technically rated offeror.  The tradeoff process, associated with Best Value involves a comparative weighing of the evaluation factors and sub-factors identified in the Request for Proposals (RFP).   Specifically, the trade off process involves selecting the most advantageous offer based upon an integrated assessment of both non-cost/price factors, taken in their assigned relative importance.  

The following factors, in their relative order of weighting, will be utilized to evaluate the offers:

The upgradeability of the system is crucial to future operations.  Proposals which fail, to demonstrate, a configuration that can be upgraded and the commitment to provide such an upgrade will receive a zero weight factor.  The ability of a manufacturer to design, fabricate and install the proposed equipment will bear on the overall rating.  Systems upgrades in development and testing will carry a greater weighting then proposed designs.


1)	Factor					
Upgradeability				
- A cold or thermal assisted, field emission source to replace the LaB6 emitter
- STEM capability, with an annular dark-field detector
- Electron holography capability

The General Technical Specifications are the minimum desired configuration. A fully compliant system will carry a weight of .75% of the total weighting for this section.  Parameters exceeding or failing to meet the minimum configuration will be evaluated based upon their relative importance to system operation.  The ability of a manufacturer to design, fabricate and install the proposed equipment will bear on the overall rating. The Acceptable range was formulated to be tolerant of minor deviations from the established minimum requirements

2)	Factor					
	Configuration			  	   
- Four ports in the objective polepiece, or in the specimen chamber, two for gas in, one for mass spectrometer, and one for EDS.  Gas pressure at the specimen shall cover a range from 10-7 to 10-2pa.
-	An UHV compatible EDS system

3)	Factor					
	Configuration			  	   
- Differential pumping for the gas-reaction chamber with two differential apertures above and two below the objective polepiece

4)	Factor					
Configuration

<DESC>PERFORMANCE BASED LOGISTICS (PBL) MARKET SURVEY FOR THE ADVANCED AVIATION FORWARD AREA REFUELING SYSTEM (AAFARS) Purpose: The purpose of this survey is to solicit interest in the implementation of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) for the Advanced Aviation Forward Area Refueling System (AAFARS). The Army is looking for potential contractors to perform in the role of Product S upport Integrator/ Product Support Provider for the AAFARS. In Accordance With (IAW) AR 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is the preferred support strategy for materiel systems.  The Army will implement PBL on weapon systems in order to provide the war fighter incr eased operational readiness; increased reliability; enhanced logistics response times; enhanced deployment support; enhanced wartime support; reduction in the logistics footprint, and reduction in logistics costs.  The selected PBL contractor will be responsible for some portion of the system logistics support, which could include, but is not limited to, supply chain management (parts support) for field and sustainment level maintenance, sustainment level maintenance  (scheduled and unscheduled), and sustainment training. The Army will retain responsibility for the scheduled and unscheduled field maintenance of AAFARS units.  Operator and maintenance training, and New Equipment Training (NET) will be TACOM responsibili ty.  The system support processes will be transparent to the war fighter.  In addition, the Product Manager will be responsible for system configuration, including recommendation and implementation of configuration changes to improve performance, reliabili ty and maintenance. PBL Definition: See Appendix A for Definitions of PBL and other frequently used terminology. Intent: Length/Type of Contract: Contract is expected to be a Firm Fixed Price Contract for up to 5 years.   Goals. Desired Results and Outcomes:  Expected performance results from the PBL provider for the AAFARS is achievement of efficiencies that drives the system to an increase in operational availability by; reducing the logistics footprint; reducing maintenance/rep air times for scheduled and unscheduled sustainment level maintenance; providing relief to the army from conducting sustainment training, and ultimately reducing O&S costs to the Army.   Measurements: Level of performance shall be expressed in measurable outcomes and achievement of those outcomes by objective evaluation. Reduced Logistics Footprint: * Measurable reduction in the time it takes to deliver field and sustainment level spare and repair parts to the requiring organization Reduced maintenance/repair times: * Measurable reduction in the cycle time it takes to return repaired sustainment level equipment/parts to the supply system. Relief from conducting sustainment training: * Measurable reduction in the number of sustainment training classes conducted by the Army. PBL System Candidates: Systems that will be supported using PBL are those systems currently in production, systems currently in the Army fleet, and those undergoing reset/recap.  Operational profile is for wartime Operations Tempo (Optempo).  See Appendix B for a profile of the AAFARS. PBL MARKET SURVEY QUESTIONAIRE FOR THE ADVANCED AVIATION FORWARD AREA REFUELING SYSTEM (AAFARS) Name of Company: Address: City, State, Zip Code: Point of Contact (POC) information: Name: Telephone Number: Email Address: Website Address: What is the business of the your company; i.e. large business, small business, 8 (a)? 1.  Describe your companys experience, if any, in providing PBL support to army vehicles or systems. 2.  Have you successfully performed the in the role of Product Support Integrator/ Product Support Provider on any other army or DoD vehicles or system? If so, on which vehicles or systems and what was the extent of the support provided? 3. If you have performed under a PBL con tract in the past, what are some of the best practices you have used to be successful? 4. What would be your plan for managing the supply chain (parts support) for field and sustainment level maintenance and integrating that with the current organic system? 5. What potential constraints and boundaries do you anticipated within the responsibilities of managing a PBL support contract? 6. How do you propose the government should measure the specific areas of performance related to reducing the logistics footprint, reducing maintenance/repair times, and providing relief from conducting sustainment training?  What recommendations can your organization provide? 7. What would be your plan for reducing maintenance/repair times for scheduled and unscheduled sustainment level maintenance? 8. How would your company manage a sustainment training program and reduce the Armys training burden?  9. Would your company be interested in providing PBL support under a long-term contract?    10. Compare and contrast the different strategies your company would utilize in wartime vs. peacetime situations. 11. Do you feel the desired results and outcomes as defined above are attainable? 12. Are there any other areas of logistics support in which your company would be interested in providing a service? Send responses to this market research survey questionnaire to the PM POCs by email: Joe Scott e-mail address: scottjoe@tacom.army.mil and Mathew Marturano e-mail address: marturam@tacom.army.mil   Your organization may provide response to all or part of t his questionnaire. Replies to this questionnaire must be received by 24 Feb 05.   The response can be marked as confidential.  Clearly indicate that the information is Proprietary if appropriate.  All participation is voluntary and no compensation will be provided for resp onding to this survey. The Army appreciates your participation in this survey.   APPENDIX A DEFINITIONS Performance Based Logistics (PBL): PBL is a product support strategy in which the logistics requirements are stated as expected results (outcomes), and wherein the responsibility and accountability of meeting these expectations fall on the Product and/or P rogram Managers (PM's), their designated Product Support Integrator (PSI), and their support provider(s).   PBL is: - Buying results not resources - Using performance specs not design specs - Buying solution or an outcome not defining the process and methods to achieve a    predetermined course of action. - About assigning responsibility to the supplier not the requiring organization. Performance Support Integrator (PSI):  The PSI is intended to identify a single source as being responsible and accountable for providing product support to the assigned Defense/Army system.  This is designated to an agency (private, public sector or a pri vate/public sector partnership).       Product Support Provider (PSP):  The PSP is anyone that provides a logistics/support product or service in support of a materiel system.  This term applies to all providers that have not been designated by the PM as the PSI.  The PSI will be required to ne gotiate Performance Based Agreements (PBA) type arrangements with all PSPs to fulfill their responsibility.   Examples of PSPs include:  DLA centers, AMC MSC Inventory Materiel Management Centers (IMMCs), Depots, contractors sub-contractors, etc. New Equipment Training: The identification of personnel, training, and training aids and devices and the transfer of knowledge gained during development from the materiel developer/provider to the trainer, user, and supporter. Sustainment Training: Individual and collective training conducted in the unit or resident schools, units, and organizations to ensure continued expertise on the operations, employment, and logistics support of fielded systems or equipment. Sustainment Maintenance: Sustainment mai ntenance is off-system maintenance and is mainly repair of defective equipment/parts. Sustainment maintenance returns repaired equipment/parts to the supply system. It covers selected Direct Support (DS) tasks, General Support (GS) maintenance. Field Maintenance: Field maintenance is on-system maintenance and is mainly replacement of defective parts and preventative maintenance. Field maintenance returns repaired equipment to the soldier. It covers crew, unit, and selected Direct Support (DS) mai ntenance tasks. Some off-system maintenance can be done at field level if, based on task analysis, it is simple to complete or it is critical to mission readiness. Operational Availability: A measure of the degree to which a system is either operating or is capable of operating at any time when used in a typical operational and support environment. APPENDIX B PROFILE FOR THE AAFARS System:  Advanced Aviation Forward Area Refueling System (AAFARS) Model Designators:  M100A1 NSN 4930-01-495-0024, Model M100 NSN 4930-01-380-4856. System Description:  The AAFARS M100/M100A1 are modular, air-emplaced refueling systems used for aircraft refueling at sites which are inaccessible by ground transport or the urgency of the situation requires rapid emplacement and/or lateral movement of fo rward refueling sites. Operational Mode Summary/Mission Profile (OMS/MP):  AAFARS fulfills the requirement for an air emplaced, four-point refueling capability for use when aircraft refueling sites are inaccessible by ground transport or the urgency of the situation requires rapid emplacement and/or lateral movement of forward re fueling sites.   Operations are expected to take place only once at a geographical location and then be relocated to reduce threat action.  Two AAFARS are needed to establish an eight-point FARP and one AAFARS can establish a four-point jump FARP. The AAFARS will normally be air emplaced by UH-60 and CH-47 aircraft. The basis of issue will be a 1:2 to attack aviation battalions or aviation units replacing the FARE.  Units which will use and support the equipment include all combat and combat service support aviation units. Environmental Conditions.  The environmental conditions in which the AAFARS will be operated are shown in table below.     Climatic Design Types                 Usage      (AR 70-38)                           (Percent)        Hot                                   20        Basic                                 80 OEM: BAE Systems, Ontario, CA Availability of TDP: The Army does not own a TDP, the system was procured with a performance based data in accordance with the requirements in purchase description (PD) ATPD 2294, Dated 4 Dec 01.  Configuration Stability: System configuration is currently frozen. Fleet Assessment: AAFARS is in Full Rate Production (FRP). The initial quantities to be delivered are 407. There are two configurations of the AAFARS, each has an Expected Useful Life of 25 years.  There are 47 M100 AAFARS M100 systems in the field.  This predecessor to the M100A1 is essentially the same.  The M100 model has a different pump and minor differences that will not significantly affect the maintenance of the system, in terms of hours or manpower to maintain. Annual Support Workload (Maintenance AMMS): The AAFARS maintenance estimate is based on war-time usage rates of continuous daily operation.  Under this scenario the estimated hours to maintain the systems are 661 hours of field level maintenance and 53 7ho urs of direct and general support maintenance per year. Reliability :. The AAFARS demonstrates a mean time between essential function failures of greater then 195 hours.  The maintenance ratio shall be less than 0.05.  Mean time to repair shall be less than 1 hour.  The maximum time to repair 90% of the repairs  shall be less than 2 hours. Annual Sustainment Parts Cost: Life Cycle Cos t Estimate states $1839 per system for annual replenishment of spare replacements and consumables. Current Organic Support:        a.    Maintenance.  The AAFARS technical manual has a three-level maintenance concept:  unit, direct, and general support.  The system Preventive Maintenance, Checks and Services (PMCS) should not exceed 20 minutes before operation and 10 minutes afte r-operation and will consist primarily of visual inspection of equipment.  During operation, the PMCS will consist of equipment observations, cleaning of equipment being used, and replacement of expendable supplies, as required.    b.  Manpower and Personnel.  The fielding of the AAFARS will not result in a requirement for additional personnel.  No new MOS or additional skill identifier will be required to operate or maintain the AAFARS.  The primary operator of the AAFARS will be MOS 92F.  The AAFARS will not add any additional limitations on the operator or maintainer MOSs.     c.   Supply Support.  The AAFARS will be supported logistically by military personnel using the most cost and operationally effective means available for the particular situation.

<SUBJECT>B--Milk River Water rights Settlement Development Study
<DESC>This is a sole source procurement in accordance with FAR 13.106(b) for consulting services to the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) of the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) in regards to quantifying economic impacts and trade-offs of a Comprehensive Milk River Water Right Settlement (Comprehensive Settlement).  Reclamation and the Federal Negotiating Team needs to determine the economic impacts and trade-offs of various settlement options consistent with: 1) the current Reserved Water Rights Compact between the two tribes of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation (FBIR); 2.) Water Claims and Settlement Options for the Blackfeet Indian Reservation; 3) the Rehabilitation of the St. Marys Canal and related water storage and delivery facility and; 4) the State of Montana.  This is to be completed using an economic model developed by the sole source contractor who has proprietary rights to said model.  Any change in the current model would require acceptance by the State of Montana, and the Fort Belknap Indian Community.  The timely nature of this acquisition requires it to meet the 2006 fall deadline, precluding any alternative economic models to be proposed and approved.  This Comprehensive Settlement agreement is to be presented to the Congress of the United States for ratification.

<SUBJECT>R -- R-Office Relocation Planning and Coordination
<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau Headquarters has over 4,400 employees and contractors occupying office space in Prince George’s County, Maryland at the Suitland Federal Center, Washington Plaza, the Silver Hill Executive Plaza, and the Bowie Computer Center.  Because of growth and the need for modernization of its facilities, the Census Bureau has commenced the Building Modernization and Consolidation Project (BMCP) to modernize its headquarters office facilities and to consolidate its headquarters staff at the Suitland Federal Center.  Two new office facilities are under construction, and occupancy will be completed in two phases—the first phase is scheduled for May-October 2006 and the second phase for November 2006-March 2007.  The Administrative and Customer Services Division (ACSD) is responsible for planning, coordinating, and executing the BMCP.  Each division within the Bureau is responsible for communicating move information to their staff and providing specific information on the organizational requirements to ACSD.  The purpose of this requirement is to provide expert planning and coordinating services to the Field Division (FLD) for facilitating preparation and execution of the relocation of its offices into the North Building of the new U.S. Census Bureau Headquarters Facility in accordance with the Master Move Schedule (hereinafter referred to as “the move”).  The objectives of this requirement are to (a) provide clear, accurate, and timely communication of move-related information and guidance to FLD headquarters staff; (b) provide effective coordination with ACSD on behalf of FLD in preparation for and execution of the move; and (c) provide guidance and on-site assistance to FLD headquarters staff in preparation for and execution of the move.  The specific tasks include (1) developing and executing a Communications Plan for dissseminating move-related information to FLD staff that will accomodate the special needs of FLD and potential impact on its activities, (2) developing and executing a Materials Management Plan that will guide and assist FLD staff in paring its voluminous program materials to its essentials and organizing them in the new office space, (3) providing on-site assistance to FLD staff for the pre- and post move inventories to ensure that all FLD property is recorded and verified, (4) developing and obtaining FLD management approval of a Layout Plan that overlays the placement of FLD personnel and property on a space schematic, and (5) participating in on-site planning meetings.  The Government intends to award a sole source purchase order for the required services to the Federal Disputes Resolution Center, a certified Hubzone business concern located in Fairfax, VA.  The total value of this requirement is less than the simplified acquisition threshhold set forth in FAR Subpart 2.101.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source . Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note No. 28 applies.

<SUBJECT>D -- SSA WebService Beta Test 2006
<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE TO:   Software Developers:  Web Service Beta Test -- THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION, NO CONTRACT WILL BE ISSUED---

Introduction:

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is pleased to announce that, in 2006, Business Services Online (BSO) will beta test a web service for uploading wage files and viewing the status of submitted wage reports.  SSA will test the services provided on BSO within a distributed, service-oriented architecture, for Electronic Wage Report (EWR). 

As a result, SSA is interested in having companies who provide wage reporting (Form W-2) software applications and services, participate in this EWR web service Beta test.  The beta test is structured to use the "consolidator" model, where the participating company serves as a conduit to receive wage reports from their customer base and programmatically transfer the data to SSA.  In a similar manner, each company will be capable of providing the vehicle for retrieving the status of submissions from SSA for their customers.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION:
The EWR web service is a J2EE application which uses SOAP and WSDL specifications.  The secure offering adheres to Version 1.0 of the Web Services-Interoperability Organization (WS-I) Basic Profile.  SOAP message integrity is ensured by following Web Services Security Version 1.0 standards.  Because of this approach to standardization, Consolidator companies can program in their environment of choice (e.g., Java, Visual Studio .NET, Perl) to invoke the service and feel confident that their message payload is not compromised upon delivery to SSA.  

The wage file submission service will accept binary files in MMREF format as input, and these files may be optionally compressed. Files may be attached to the message using the SOAP Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism, or they may be transmitted inline as base64 encoded data.

Throughout 2006, SSA will be finalizing this EWR web service offering and allowing companies to participate in planned alpha tests in May of this year.  The Web Services Description Language (WSDL) required to invoke the service will be made available to the public in early March with a developer’s guide to follow shortly thereafter.  A draft of the WSDL is available upon request.  If you want a copy of the draft WSDL, email your request to SSNVS@ssa.gov.   

Participating companies will need to register with BSO’s Integrated Registration System (IRES) to obtain a Web Service PIN and are prepared to support the beta test period, but we are not ready to do this registration at this time.

Tentative key dates for the web service pilot are:

Alpha Testing start date:  	06/05/06
Full Validation start date: 	07/05/06
Integration Testing start date:	10/02/06
Beta Testing release date:	12/16/06.  

SELECTION CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE BETA TEST OF THE WEB SERVICE:

1. Currently write your own wage reporting software.
2. Currently send Forms W-2 to SSA for processing or provide the ability for your customers to do so.
3. Ability to modify your wage reporting environment so you can start alpha testing with SSA on June 5, 2006.

Local national contractor employees requiring access to United States Air Force-occupied United Kingdom bases must comply with Third Air Force Instruction 31-501, and all local Security Forces requirements.  This is an overview and does not contain all the specifics contained in the Instruction.2.  New contractor employees may be escorted onto the installation, only, to fill out paperwork.  The employee is not to start work until all required paperwork has been submitted to the appropriate office.3.  Prior to beginning employment on the installation, individuals must, at a minimum, have a completed Local Files Check (LFC).  Individuals with LFCs, are required to be escorted by an authorized US citizen (reference Instruction 31-501 for US citizen clearance requirements) or a local national with a Security Check (SC) who has escort authority.4.  Unescorted access requires a Host Agency Check (HAC).  There are two levels of background investigations that meet the standards that meet this requirement.  The level of background check required, will depend on whether the position is considered sensitive or non-sensitive.  Only people with SC will be able to escort people onto the installation.a.  The Counter Terrorist Check (CTC).  The CTC is a national-level security and police background investigation conducted by the Defence Vetting Agency (DVA).   This is the minimum check required for all contractor/subcontractor employees in non-sensitive positions requiring unescorted installation access.  The CTC expires three years from the issue date. b.  The Security Check (SC).  The SC includes all of the elements of the CTC but is a more comprehensive investigation and includes such actions as a credit check, interviewing relatives, determining and evaluating the individual’s involvement in various organizations, verifying any past military experience, etc.  This is the minimum check required for employees and contractor personnel in sensitive positions.  Most SCs expire five years from the issue date.5.  Individuals employed in sensitive positions may only be assigned to and or perform the non-sensitive portion of the position until the SC is positively completed or they must be provided with direct supervision by a U.S. citizen or an individual with a completed SC. 6.  Investigation renewal.  All employees renewing their background investigation will complete an MOD Form 1109, Security Questionnaire.  On the front cover of the form, under General Details, the employee will mark the appropriate block indicating a security questionnaire has been completed before and will complete the form with current information.  Renewal paperwork should be submitted 6 months prior to the current background expiration date to avoid a possible lapse in installation access. 7.  Functional Quality Assurance Personnel (QAP) will be the point-of-contact for processing security clearances.  They will provide necessary documents to contractor employees, compile completed forms, submit documents to Security Forces, and sign USAFE Form 79.  The following must be accomplished ‘in-turn’ for all new contractor employees. Contractor will provide the following to QAP: Completed LCF (conducted by HAC Office), Completed MOD Form 1109, Security Questionnaire (required for CTC or SC; completed by unit submitter), Completed USAFE Form 19, Residency Check for Employment with United States Air Forces in Europe, Completed AF Form 2583, Request for Personnel Security Action, Completed USAFE Form 79, Application for Base Entry Identification (completed by unit submitter/to be completed once the individual has been cleared), Completed Basic Check Verification Record (BCVR)(verified and signed by unit submitter) 8.  Upon receipt of a favourable HAC and all required documentation, the contractor employee will be issued a USAFE Form 79 which must be in the employee's possession at all times while on the installation.  The expiration date of the Form 79 will be the contract expiration date or one year, whichever is shorter.

Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the National Stock Number, Nomenclature, Part Number and Unit Price.   NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

This synopsis/solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations for pickup trucks to be used by the Government of Bolivia pursuant to an agreement with the U.S. Department of State. 


1.0.	DESCRIPTION

The U.S. Department of State, Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) of the U.S. Embassy in La Paz, Bolivia has a requirement for the procurement of up to 90 new pickup trucks to replace old equipment and to allow for an expansion of  NAS support to counternarcotics operations in Bolivia. The primary use of the vehicles will be for the transportation of personnel and supplies to support these operations. The vehicles must be suitable for extensive travel in rural areas and smaller cities and towns, where deeply rutted and unpaved roads are the norm. They must also be suitable for travel to remote and mountainous regions, which are accessible only by difficult-to-drive, twisting, narrow and unpaved roads that border on 3,000 to 5,000 foot drops. The vehicles will also be used for travel to densely forested areas and must be dependable in heavy mud, which is often encountered during rainy season.


The vehicle offered must be capable of being maintained commercially in Bolivia in locations far from the main urban areas and must be covered by the manufacturer’s warranties. Quoters must demonstrate that the vehicles offered can withstand continuous use in Bolivia’s extremely rugged terrain and harsh climatic conditions, and that the vehicles are cost-effective to operate and maintain. The supplied vehicles are to be “new,” which is defined as “having zero miles.” Low mileage and/or demonstration models are not considered to be new.  Delivery of anything other than new vehicles shall be rejected and returned at no cost to the Government. The resulting contract type shall be firm-fixed price.

Local clause 52.111-4131 states:  'Pro cedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice.  Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehic le Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehic le access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicle s must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Co ntractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the ga te guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12 feet-5 inches clearance ) will require a time stamped 'searched' label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  'Searched' labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12 feet -5 inches in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a 'searched' label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comp ly with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Lev el Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must hav e a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Ou t Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate o r, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.'  Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  'a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must ob tain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont  Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate P rogram.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contract or (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting t he CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access ide ntification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the crit eria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits h is/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any  reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the requir ed identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice t o the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.   If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed  by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while pe rforming work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for perfo rmance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purpo ses of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to wh ether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.'
