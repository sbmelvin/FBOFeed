<DESC>SERVICES SOURCES SOUGHT. The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Atmospheric Turbulence & Diffusion Division, (ATDD) has a requirement for consulting services for the Computer Network Configuration. A contract was awarded to Wood International to provide these services.  Prior to this contract, Wood International assisted in the design and set up of the ATDD?s internal network (LAN).  Wood International has proprietary rights to the data that is not privy to the Government. The Government solicited and negotiated with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302 which states, ?The services are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy agency requirements.? The only known source for these services is Wood International, 108 Newhaven Road, Oak Ridge, TX 37830-8112, primarily because of the development of proprietary software and databases, their knowledge to perform the function, and their unique understanding of the programs and business practices of ATDD gained through its performance on previous contracts. Wood International has demonstrated expertise and unique knowledge of the ATDD and it?s programs.  The Government is currently examining the degree of proprietary software and databases the Wood Group has developed and the extent to which it limits competition.  At it?s discretion, the Government may not exercise future options for extended performance, should it find that competition is feasible.  The Contractor must provide for local part-time, as needed, network and computer support at ATDD and at in-house and field operations in Oak Ridge, TN.  This support includes assistance with internal and external networking; server operation; computer security; desktop and notebook computers and software; software development, troubleshooting and maintenance, PC-based data acquisition and storage in support of field measurement programs, research programs, meteorological measurements and nuclear/biological/chemical materials detection system development in support of homeland security-related efforts; Linux cluster operations for mesoscale and dispersion modeling; development and maintenance of databases and websites; and support for in-house administrative computing.  The contractor shall be available at anytime, including nights, weekends and holidays.  HPSD-12 Security Clearance and IT Security requirements are mandatory. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement rather than exercise an option. The applicable NAICS code is 541512.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but to perform market research for the referenced services. However, all proposals received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. In order to be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide the service. Such information shall include at a minimum:  name; telephone number and point of contact; ability and authority to perform the work described herein; and the names and telephone numbers of firms to whom this service or similar products have been previously provided and familiarity with databases Wood Group has developed. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability by submitting the information requested above referencing Contract No. WC133R-06-CN-0273.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

I.	BACKGROUND
History of the activities surrounding this specific requirement:
The work is to be done as part of a project funded by NIST Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory to research the development of fast time scale electrochemistry, defined as measurement of electrochemical processes at time scales of less than 10 nanoseconds.  The goal of work is to determine methods to measure electrochemical signals at fast time scale and use them for motion control.  The challenges inherent in performing these activities at radio frequency require a specialized skill set.  The contractor must have experience working with electrochemical systems using nanosecond timescale signals, using electrochemical signals for motion control systems, and use of the fast time scale electrochemical signals to measure electrochemical phenomena that are confined to nanometer-scale spatial dimensions.

Why the Government has a need for this requirement:
The Government has need for research and development associated with nanotechnology as a strategic focus area.  Nanomanufacturing is a key area in this effort, and fast time scale nanoscale electrochemical measurement will provide significant benefits to those seeking to use electrochemistry for the creation of nanoscale products.  
Any inter-relationships within NIST, other agencies, or other organizations:
No.

Other information which would provide vendors with a better perspective of the requirement:
A specialized skill set will be required to effectively perform the desired work.  The contractor must have experience performing electrochemical machining, researching electrochemical systems using nanosecond timescale signals, using electrochemical signals for motion control systems, and use of the fast time scale electrochemical signals to measure electrochemical phenomena that are confined to nanometer-scale spatial dimensions as evidenced by prior work, publications, or patents.
