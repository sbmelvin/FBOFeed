<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be <br />contacted-</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<DESC>This is a revised market survey, for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes.  This is not a solicitation for proposals.  The Government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this market survey.   <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Engineer District - Japan is planning to solicit a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for environmental services to provide quality environmental services for various Department of Defense (DoD) components of the United States Forces Japan (USFJ) in Japan.  Consistent with the Status of Forces Agreement between the United States and Japan, only local sources will be considered under this solicitation.  Local sources are entities or organizations, for example, corporations or partnerships, that are physically located in Japan and authorized (i.e., licensed, registered, etc.) to perform in Japan, the type of work specified in this request for information.   <br>  <br> A MATOC is a type of Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  Actual projects are awarded through issuance of task orders.  The multiple awardees get fair opportunity for task order awards, which mean MATOC contractors generally compete with each other for task orders.  There are some exceptions to this rule, whereby competition may be reduced or task orders may be issued non-competitively to one contract holder.   <br>  <br> The Government anticipates award of two (2) or more contracts under the MATOC to experienced sources capable of performing a wide range of environmental service projects.  The MATOC will consist of a one-year base period and four (4) one-year option periods.  The total maximum amount the Government will order under all three contracts combined is the not-to-exceed amount of $9,000,000 (yen equivalent).  The guaranteed minimum for the base and option years is $5,000 (yen equivalent).  The minimum task order amount is $5,000 (yen equivalent). <br>  <br> Although the requirements and environmental services awarded vary from year-to-year, specific types of work executed can be categorized within the five types of environmental services listed below.  Examples are provided for each environmental service type contract awarded.  This data is historical data provided only for information and does not represent an estimate of specific work requirements anticipated for the life of the MATOC contract.  By its nature, an IDIQ contract such as the MATOC, indicates that actual required delivery dates and quantities are unknown.   <br> a.	Environmental surveys sampling, testing, monitoring, and analyses.  <br> Project examples: air emission source testing for boilers and generators, petroleum oil lubricant tank integrity testing.  <br> b.	Environmental impact analysis documentation <br> Project example: Environmental Reviews in accordance with Executive Order 12114.  <br> c.	Scientific and technical investigations and studies <br> Project examples: biological survey (flora/fauna); cultural resource survey, and archaeological testing. <br> d.	Planning studies and management plans <br> Project examples: Integrated Natural and Cultural Resource Management Plans.  <br> e.	Remedial actions, mitigation, and environmental-related site improvements <br> Project examples: asbestos survey, and erosion stabilization. <br> f.	Geographical Information System (GIS) services.  <br> Project examples: Mapping of natural and cultural resources, topographic surveys and global positioning system (GPS) feature location.  <br>  <br> The Government will provide the Contractor a statement of work or performance work statement with each task order under the MATOC.  The contractor will be required to comply with the Japanese Environmental Governing Standards; Japanese national or local environmental laws and regulations; United States (U.S.) environmental laws and regulations and/or DoD policy and instructions and all other requirements of the contract and task orders.   <br>  <br> Task order award will generally be based on any one, or combination of 1) price, 2) schedule, 3) technical approach, experience, and qualifications, and 4) past performance.  The criteria will be specified in the contract and request for proposals for task orders. <br>  <br> All interested contractors are requested to furnish responses and comments on the topics listed in the attached Comment Form.
