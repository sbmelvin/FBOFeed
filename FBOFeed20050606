<DESC>The Navy intends to procure on a sole source basis, 76 each AL2 ANTENNA MASTS Part Number BSM2-M-M215-JBS-000 from Bluesky Mast, Inc. 1202 W North B St.  Tampa, FL 33606, to support currently deployed 500-foot sloping V long wire antennas.  The antenna will be replacing models originally fielded with the Joint Base Station (JBS) (V2)D systems which were found to be insufficiently strong to support the 500-foot sloping V antenna.  The AL2 antenna masts are required to provide the JBS (V2)D Naval Special Warfare (NSW) and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) systems with continuous-uninterrupted communication capabilities by securing the antennas which transmit and receive signals.   The manufactured masts will be stong enough to support the 500-foot long sloping V antennas, yet flexible enough to bend without breaking; even in the event of extreme conditions, thus preventing a catastrophic failure.  The mast system must be lightweight; the tripod, mast sections, and all accessories, which comprise the 15 meter mast must weigh no more than 70 pounds and be deliverable in a durable rollaway bag making for easy transportation and storage.         

      For JBS transportation requirements the masts must be capable of loading onto a 	436L (104 X 84 inches usable area) pallet without special accommodations. 	Special accommodations could be defined as special mounting racks or any 	additional supporting structure that requires space and weight on the pallet.  The 	chosen mast must be one person deployable and 1 person portable.  This would 	include all accessories and special adapters.  The JBS system deploys an SC-303B 	SATCOM and AS-3166.  They must be able to be mounted onto the mast without 	the need to manufacture special mounting solutions in house.  In situations when 	useable deployment area is limited, such as wooded areas or mountainous terrain, 	the mast must be capable of deploying, per mast, up to 4 antennas (up to 50 	pounds) on a winching assembly. Due to the broad range of deployable theaters of 	operation, the mast must be impervious to sandy and salt/fog conditions. The 	requirement would call for sealed mechanisms and 100% corrosion free 	components.  

The required delivery date for these masts is 26 Sept 2005 to NAWCAD, Webster Field, St. Ingoes, MD 20684.

<DESC>The US Department of Interior, through its Franchise Fund activity GovWorks, will procure evaluation services of the Perennial Category C APH Crop Insurance Program on behalf of the US Department of Agriculture, Risk Management Agency (RMA), Office of Research and Development.  RMA's mission is to promote, support and regulate sound risk management solutions to preserve and strengthen the economic stability of America's agricultural producers. RMA was created in 1996 and operates and manages the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) as part of its mission.  RMA provides crop insurance to American producers via FCIC.  While fourteen private-sector insurance companies sell and service the crop insurance policies, RMA develops and approves the premium rates, administers premium and expense subsidy, approves and supports products, and reinsures the 14 companies.  The objectives of the contract resulting from the upcoming solicitation are as follows:  1) Provide a comprehensive evaluation of the existing perennial Category C APH crop insurance program, underwriting methods and procedures used;  2) Provide an assessment on whether present underwriting methods and procedures are appropriate to maintain an actuarially sound insurance program and establish uniformity and consistency by crop or crops across RMA regions; and,  3) Provide recommendations for program improvements.  It is expected that the resultant contractor will have to travel to Kansas City, MO; Davis, Utah; Raleigh, NC; Spokane, Washington; Springfield, Illinois; and, Valdosta, Georgia.  While the Government anticipates the work to span five (5) months, offerors will have the option to propose differently.  In accordance with FAR Part 5, it is anticipated that the solicitation will be released as a Request for Proposals on June 21, 2005, under Solicitation No. 14350405RP43251.  Potential offerors should check the FedBizOpps website for details on the solicitation.  The solicitation will be set-aside for small businesses under NAICS code 541990 which has a size standard of $6 million.  The resultant contract is expected to be time-and-materials.  NO PROPOSALS ARE REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  Any questions regarding this procurement should be directed to Melissa A. Onyszko at 703-787-1356 or Melissa.onyszko@mms.gov.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is soliciting proposals for approximately 6-12 task order contracts to provide the services for the project entitled “Developing Evidence to Inform Decisions about Effectiveness: The DEcIDE Network”.  The purpose is to create a collaborative research and practice-based network program that will assist AHRQ and other Federal Agencies with implementation of Section 1013 of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA).  

The DEcIDE network will provide a variety of services and products to support the development of new scientific knowledge through research on the outcomes of health care items and services.  Activities performed by the DEcIDE network will reflect the general principle that clinicians and patients should have the best available evidence available upon which to make choices in health care items and services.  Hence, the network will rapidly develop scientific evidence and new analytic tools to assist healthcare providers, patients, and policy makers with making informed decisions about the comparative effectiveness, appropriateness, and outcomes of healthcare items and services, particularly prescription medications.  DEcIDE research centers will be expected to work closely with other AHRQ programs involved with implementing Section 1013, including the Evidence-based Practice Centers (EPC’s), the Eisenberg Center for Clinical Decision Science, the Centers for Education and Research on Therapeutics (CERTs), the Integrated Delivery System Research Network (IDSRN), the Primary Care Practice-Based Research Networks (PBRNs), the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), and the Healthcare Cost & Utilization Project (HCUP).  Sharing of expertise and other resources between DEcIDE centers and across other relevant AHRQ programs is strongly encouraged.  Periods of performance will vary, ranging from 30 days up to the length of the contract, depending on the complexity of the topic or depth of the activity requirements.  Research centers will also be expected to have the methodological competence and management flexibility (capacity) to satisfy a range of tasks that need to be performed concurrently.  

DEcIDE research centers will be expected to demonstrate methodological expertise in the assessment of a broad range of scientific data, such as data from randomized controlled trials, computerized pharmacy records, diagnostic studies, technology assessments, epidemiologic and social sciences research (including but not limited to economics, sociology, and behavioral research).  A DEcIDE research center may:  1) perform secondary database analyses to compare health outcomes (e.g., hospitalizations, deaths, patient costs, morbidity) according to medication use within a class of drugs or according to a particular therapeutic approach; 2) study the comparative effectiveness and outcomes of different therapeutic approaches including use of medical device(s); 3) conduct methodological studies to develop new ways of identifying over- and under-utilization of therapies; 4) develop computer algorithms to identify inappropriate prescribing patterns; 5) evaluate the effects of insurance benefit and drug formulary structure on health outcomes; 6) conduct clinical economics studies;  7) evaluate patient and prescriber decision-making tools; 8) conduct methodological and statistical research to advance the scientific use and establishment of disease registries, clinical repositories and health databases; 9) perform accelerated studies comparing the clinical effectiveness of common treatment options in the elderly; 10) conduct simulations and modeling studies of clinical pathways and health outcomes; 11) carry out evaluations of innovative healthcare services that reduce inappropriate healthcare utilization; 12) design and implement prospective studies to examine health outcomes of diagnostic tests and treatments; 13) conduct retrospective genetic studies to ascertain potential benefits of genetic tests in reducing adverse events or improving efficacy;  14) provide technical assistance as needed; and 15) other assignments as requested.

The DEcIDE research centers are to be comprised of core staff of experienced professionals in fields such as medicine, nursing, pharmacy, epidemiology, statistics, computer science, information science, health services research, behavioral research, public health, social sciences, and science writing and editing.  Sources must also possess, or be able obtain (in-house or through subcontracting arrangements), the staff and resources needed to expeditiously carry out the different types of activities listed above.  It is AHRQ’s expectation that at least one topic-specific content expert will be included as key personnel for each Task Order.

It is anticipated that 6-12 task order contracts will be awarded for a period of 5 years.  Award is expected by September 30, 2005.  In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will also be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQs website at www.ahrq.gov.  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and monitor the site for any subsequent amendments.  Since it is not known who is downloading the solicitation, a bidders list will not be available.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be evaluated by AHRQ.  It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on or about June 21, 2005, with proposals due 30 days thereafter.

<CONTACT>Jon Morse Contract Specialist 3032393678     Jon_Morse@co.blm.gov;
<DESC>There are approximately 1500 abandoned mines located on public lands in the Upper Animas Watershed.  Several of these sites have been remediated or partially remediated, while others have yet to be characterized.  There is a need for monitoring of sites, and site characterization sampling for purposes of preparing preliminary investigation reports and planning for remedial activities. For the 2005 field season, several sites require monitoring to determine the success of the remedial work already performed.  It is necessary to perform monitoring on a timely basis in order to appropriately operate water treatment systems, as well as to determine whether or not additional remedial activities need to be undertaken at other sites.  These sites include but may not be limited to: Forest Queen, May Day, Lark, Joe and John, Elk Tunnel, North California Mountian,  Eveline, Eureka Channel, Lackawanna, Bonner, the Brooklyn and potentially several other locations that have been acquired from ASARCO and Sunnyside Gold Corp.  There also may be some sampling requested that is not routinely scheduled, and sampling may need to be performed on short notice. There are numerous mining related sites on federally managed lands that currently need some level of site characterization.  This work will include mine waste, soil, and water sampling, working with geoprobe sample interpretations and core collections, site maps and other reporting requirements.  Soil sampling analysis may include, but not be limited to: acid generation potentially, heavy metal leachate potential, heavy metal and mineral concentration, porosity, grain size analysis, and buffering capacity.  Water analysis may include measurements for alkalinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, flow rate, hardness, physical properties, total and dissolved concentrations of heavy metals, and mass loadings to the aquatic system. Specific sites that need water quality data collected monthly during the field season are the Henrietta Mine, May Day, Joe and John, Lark, Forest Queen, Elk Tunnel, Lackawanna, and a number of piezometers for groundwater quality.  Other sites will be sampled as needed. Deliverables for this project will be sampling and analytical results as required on a monthly basis for monitoring, and an annual report.  If interim data reports are received by the contractor prior to the due date of the annual report, they will be submitted to the BLM project manager as they are received.  There may also be a site assessment report prepared for data collected for the Eureka Channel feasibility study at a date yet to be determined.  There may be travel needed to present findings to interested parties. It is very important for the winning contractor to have experience in surface and groundwater hydrology, water quality data collection, quality control and quality assurance plan preparation and procedures, geoprobe sampling methods and soil sample interpretations, abandoned mining program and restoration procedures and familiarity with the Upper Animas River watershed.  For individual bidders a resume should document experience in these areas.  For organizations, a statement of qualifications should document relevant experience. The associated solicitation will be issued June 6, 2005.

NNSA OST has determined that Primavera (P3e/c) is the only item capable of meeting NNSA OST mission requirements, and PM Tech is the only firm capable of providing this product as the sole Primavera authorized representative in the state of New Mexico. This procurement is a Small Business Set-Aside, and PM Tech is a Small Business under North American Industrial Classification Code 423430 with a size standard of 500 employees.

This project is located at the 910 Airlift Wing (AFRC), Youngstown Air Reserve Station, 3976 King Graves Rd, Vienna  OH 44473-5931 (Trumbull County).  This is a Request for Proposal (RFP), Price Performance Tradeoff (PPTO) solicitation.  There will be no public bid opening.  The closing date for submission of offers is estimated to be on or about 22 Jul 05, and will be contained in the solicitation package.  Award will be made based upon the Best Value to the Government in accordance with FAR 15.  Total contract performance period is 120 calendar days from date of award; phasing requirements will be contained in the solicitation.  The resultant award will be a Firm-Fixed Price contract.  The NIAC Code is 237990, and the Size Standard is $28.5 million average annual receipts over the past three years.

Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  It is anticipated that the following viewers will be needed to view the solicitation:  Microsoft Word (.doc), Adobe Acrobat Reader (.pdf), WinZip (.zip or .exe), and  Bid View or Max View/Source View.exe. More information concerning these viewers can be found on the FedBizOps website.

Contractors are advised that in order to receive an award as the prime contractor, they must be listed in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) database; failure to register will disqualify a contractor from award should the contractor be selected and not registered.  Contractors may register via the Internet CCR website at http://www.ccr2000.com.  Registration may take up to three weeks to process.  Recommend registering immediately in order to be eligible for timely award.  Contractors are also advised that effective immediately, they must register with the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), or risk having their proposals declared non-responsive.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, Florida intends to issue a modification to contract N61331-05-C-0022 with Sperry Marine of 1070 Seminole Trail, Charlottesville, VA 22901 for the procurement of one (1) additional Bridgemaster E radar system.  This contract modification is required because fleet deployments have significantly increased and an additional LCAC has been identified to undergo service life extension. This requirement was only recently defined and was not known at the time the procurement quantities  for this contract were established.  This item is only available from Sperry Marine. Currently the Bridgemaster E radar system, originally manufactured by Sperry Marine, has been installed on all completed SLEP LCACs and has been installed on some of the non-SLEP (pre LCAC-61) LCACs. This radar system, as previously installed, is integrated into the SLEP navigation hardware and software that will form the basis for the NDI replacement gear. Any othe! r radar system would require extensive re-development, testing and qualification costs, and duplicating the logistics train established for the SLEP LCACs. Sperry Marine, as the OEM, is the only known source for this equipment. Delivery will be the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. NAICS 334511 applies. FSC 5840. SBA standard is 750 employees.

The contractor shall provide services to include travel and material to investigate the use of  Virtual Data Retrieval Tool (VDRT), which is a component of Contractor's Proprietary Software, in a systems environment that will support Critical Infrastructure Protection Center (CIPC's) functionality requirements and operating environment.  This investigation is intended to result in a demonstration prototype that acquires data from remote data sources in a format compatible with CIPC's analytical tools.  Virtual data retrieval in this context means the importation of specific data from different remote sources in response to a query, with data import occurring at the time of the query, merging the data in a unified database using The MetadataÂ® Company's unique data language and, creating merged output of data that are compatible with CIPC's analytical tools. The demonstration prototype model will be developed based on requirements that were previoulsly established. The model will be integrated into the Critical Infrastructure Protection Center's Collaborative Information Warfare Network (CIWN).  This award expands upon the 2004 metadata model development and proof of concept of a unified database management platform that can be integrated into the following CIWN nodes: 1. Visual Links/Analyzer 2. Neural Solutions 3. Web-Enabled Service Oriented Architecture 4. General GUI Interfaces The MetadataÂ® Company intellectual property and system provide CIPC with capabilities and efficiencies based on The MetadataÂ® Company's unique data modeling language.  The MetadataÂ® Company's system is based on the data modeling language and provides data management capabilities not found elsewhere in the marketplace.  The MetadataÂ® Company's technology provides CIPC with the capability to incrementally build a data model and database system without the need to continually redesign the database as additional data and interoperability requirements are identified. The MetadataÂ® Company has patents pending on its intellectual property, including several components of its systems.   A Firm Fixed Price type contract is anticipated.

<CONTACT>John Chaney Contract Specialist 3039692303     john_chaney@nps.gov;
<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE: The National Park Service (NPS) is currently planning to award a contract to complete construction of two facilities, the Emergency Medical Services & Wildland Fire (EMS/WLF) center, and the Administration facility, located on the north rim of the Grand Canyon.      *   Procurement Background:   The NPS originally awarded task orders for construction of the two facilities. The contractor started construction, but was not able to complete the projects and thus the task orders were terminated.  The original construction team has partially completed the following general improvements: building shell, roof, siding, flooring, infrastructure, exterior finishes, windows, rough site work, interior framing, roughed in electrical, roughed in plumbing, roughed in fire sprinkler system, roughed in mechanical and roughed in communication system. The NPS is now seeking to procure completion of these projects.      *   Brief Description of Project Scope:   The successful offeror shall complete the facilities, site work, and utility improvements to provide a fully operational complex. The current construction documents (CDs) do not fully and thoroughly define every aspect of the construction effort required to complete the facilities. The CDs are in this state because they were originally generated based upon the design / build (D/B) process and the original Design / Builder halted work on these facilities prior to completion. However, a preproposal site visit will allow offerors to investigate and inspect the existing conditions of the facilities to determine the level of effort necessary to complete the project. The EMS/WLF facility is approximately 12,680 square feet. Construction of this project is approximately 50% complete. The Administration facility is approximately 2,700 square feet. Construction of this project is approximately 90% complete.      *   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the National Park Service. *   Estimated Price Range: Between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.      *   The RFP & construction documents shall be available, without charge, through www.fedbizopps.gov.      *   Preproposal Conference (site visit): Information regarding the exact time, date and location of the site visit will be included in the solicitation.      *   Award is not restricted to small businesses.      *   Proposed Contract Type:  Firm fixed price contract with lump-sum pricing.      *   Schedule (All dates are tentative and may change. Offerors should refer to the RFP for exact dates):      -  Issue Request for Proposals (RFP):  6/27/05;      -  Preproposal conference (site visit):  7/12/05;      -  Proposal due date:  7/28/05;      -  Award contract:  9/1/05;      -  Issue Notice to Proceed:  9/13/05;      -  Completion of contract performance (Administration Facility): 11/11/05;      -  Temporarily halt construction of the EMS/WLF facility due to winter road closures: 11/25/05;      -  Resume construction of the EMS/WLF facility:  4/24/06;      -  Completion of contract performance (EMS/WLF Facility):  8/25/06;      *   Evaluation Criteria / Factors:      -   Selection will be based on price and non-price factors and award will be made to the offeror presenting the Best Value to the Government. Factors are listed in descending order of importance.      Non-price factors:      1.   Project Management (Offeror's proposed plans and schedules specific to this project): The following issues will be considered in the evaluation of this factor:       -   Scope of Work & Quality Control: The method for analyzing the project scope and insuring that all aspects of the project are completed while insuring a high quality standard is maintained.      -   Schedule: How the project schedule proposes to maximize the short construction season and the method for monitoring the progress of construction to insure the project stays on schedule.      -   Cost Control: The methods to track project costs, to prevent additional costs, and to address potential changes.       -   Organization and qualifications of the proposed construction team.      -   Project location: How the proposed plan takes into account this project's remote location and its being in a national park.      -   Safety & Security: The plans method to insure a safe and secure project site.      2.   Prior Experience:      "Prior Experience" is differentiated from "Past Performance" in that this is factual, documented, information about specific work the contractor has performed, which demonstrates their technical ability to accomplish the work.   Offerors will be required to submit information regarding projects they have completed within the past 5 years. Offeror's demonstrated ability to effectively manage the following project aspects will be considered in the evaluation of this factor:      -   Government projects.      -   Quality control.      -   Schedule control. Adhering to tight schedules & providing timely completion of projects within contract requirements.      -   Cost control. Contract modification history.      -   Coordination of subcontractors.      -   Coordination and performance of similarly complex projects in remote locations.      -   Stringent safety standards.      -    Working within strong environmental guidelines.      3.   Past Performance:      Past Performance is a measure of the degree to which a contractor has satisfied its customers in the past.  The NPS will evaluate past performance based on contacting references provided by the contractor, the Government's knowledge of offeror's past performance, and / or references obtained from any other source.      Price:      All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. *   For further information call or e-mail:   John Chaney, Contract Specialist, 303-969-2303, john_chaney@nps.gov

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Procedures, and FAR Part 12 Commercial Items, the U.S. EPA National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (Ann Arbor, Michigan) requires a Gaseous Flow Calibration System. The National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) in Ann Arbor Michigan is the operating standard in the United States for automotive emissions and fuel economy measurement.  The accurate and precise measurement of gaseous flow associated with the testing of vehicles and engines is integral to this process.  The NVFEL is seeking to update its flow standardization capability, and seeks to procure a highly integrated gas flow calibrator to verify existing flow coefficients and establish flow coefficients for new gaseous flow measurement equipment.   Significant features of the procured system are to be a collection of highly accurate subsonic flow venturi to several flow ranges from 200 SCFM to 3000 SCFM, auxiliary instrumentation such as pressure and temperature sensors, other hardware such as carts and connectors to make use of the standards in as efficient and mistake-proof manner as possible, and a computer-based data collection and documentation system.  The EPA seeks a highly accurate calibration system with a calibration uncertainty of 1% or less assuming a coverage factor of 2.  Delivery of this system and selected options to NVFEL is expected within approximately 6 months or less.  This procurement is a small business set-aside under NAICS code 334513 with a size standard of 500 Employees.  Award will be made using Best Value evaluation criteria.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  Any firm believing itself capable of providing the required Gaseous Flow Calibration System must request a copy of the RFP in writing within fifteen (15) days of electronic posting of this notice.  Requests should be submitted in writing to Scott Tharp via Fax (513) 487-2107 or email Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be honored. See Note 1

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to procure on a sole source basis for the brand name Axon Genepix 4000B Microarray Scanner as authorized in FAR Part 13.1.  This acquisition will be conducted in accordance with the simplified procedures provided in FAR 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The following salient characteristics apply: 1) Ability to scan standard microscope slides bearing in-house printed microarrays or commercial microarrays from NimbleGen Biosystems, with non-confocal technology, 2) Ability to accurately and reproducibly scan at 10 micro or 5 micro resolution, to accommodate the above mentioned arrays’ format, 3) ability to scan two channels (laser excitation wavelengths of 532 and 635 nm), 4) High dynamic range of detection, 5) ability to acquire and save single or double-wavelength images of the array for analysis on NCI web-based software, 6) Must fit in a small footprint, not to exceed 16" Wide,  24" Long and 24" High, 7) Must come with software to run scanner, 8) Scanner software must enable on-the-fly feature visualization and histogram generation, for PMT optimization during scanning, and an option for automated PMT gain setting, 9) Machine software must be able to export color images in 24-bit JPEG format for analysis on NCI web-based software, 10)  Microarray analysis software must be able to recognize features that are circular, square or irregular, with some flexibility for imperfect spotting, and to align the spots in terms of row, column and block, 11)  Software must be able to import GAL files that identify the genes represented in all features, 12)  Microarray analysis software must have user-defined manual as well as automatic flagging features for quality control and normalization and, 13) Microarray analysis software must have ability to visualize background pixels and to perform multiple methods of background subtraction. Justification: The Axon Genepix 4000B microarray scanner is required for the use of the NimbleGen arrays, which are being used in current studies, are very specialized in that the size of the oligonucleotide features (5 microns) on their microarrays is so small that only certain scanners have the resolution to allow acceptable imaging and quantification of the signals produced.  The Axon Genepix 4000B microarray scanner is the most compatible scanner in using the NimbleGen microarrays. The existing scanner that NimbleGen scientists are currently using in their in-house microarray service core is the Axon Genepix 4000B. Changing the scanner for future microarrays will change the variables and will interrupt correct interpretation of the studies being currently performed.  Potential Offerors may request a copy of the solicitation from Malinda Holdcraft via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or via fax on (301) 402-4513.  If you have questions regarding this notice, they may be addressed to Malinda Holdcraft via electronic mail or telephone. Estimated issue date of the solicitation is May 19, 2005 with an estimated due date of May 26, 2005.  No collect calls will be accepted.

THUS, THE EVIDENCE DEVELOPED BY DIO INVESTIGATORS MUST CONFORM TO THIS HIGH STANDARD.

OVER ONE-THIRD OF ORI’S CASES OF RESEARCH MISCONDUCT INVOLVE HUMAN SUBJECTS IN RESEARCH, RANGING FROM SOCIAL SCIENCE INTERVIEWS OF VOLUNTEERS OR PATIENTS, TO PREVENTION AND TREATMENT TRIALS IN CLINICAL RESEARCH ON PATIENTS WITH CANCER, DIABETES, ASTHMA, AND OTHER DEBILITATING DISEASES. AN ESSENTIAL PART OF SUCH INVESTIGATIONAL CASES IS THE ANALYSIS OF CLINICAL RECORDS, INCLUDING PATIENT CHARTS, PHYSICIAN NOTES, TRIAL PROTOCOLS, PHARMACY RECORDS, CONSENT FORMS, AND RELATED DOCUMENTS, TO DETERMINE THEIR RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ANY RESULTS REPORTED THEREIN.  FORENSIC STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES ARE USED TO CHECK DATA FOR AUTHENTICITY AND ARE ESSENTIAL TO DETERMINING WHETHER DATA HAVE BEEN FALSIFIED OR FABRICATED.  SUCH ANALYSES IN CLINICAL CASES ALSO INCLUDE A REVIEW OF THE MEDICAL LITERATURE AND A DETERMINATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE QUESTIONED FINDINGS TO HUMAN HEALTH AND THEIR POTENTIAL DAMAGE TO HUMAN BEINGS IF FALSE.

PURPOSE:

THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH INTEGRITY (ORI) HAS AN ONGOING CRITICAL NEED FOR A MEDICAL EXPERT CONSULTANT, THE CONTRACTOR IS THE ONLY PERSON WITH THE NECESSARY QUALIFICATIONS, SKILLS, EXPERTISE AND PRIOR EXPERIENCE WHO IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND HAS DEMONSTRATED COMPETENCY IN ANALYZING AND RESOLVING CASES OF RESESARCH MISCONDUCT.  ABOUT 30 TO 40% OF ORI'S CASES OF RESEARCH MISCONDUCT INVOLVE ISSUES OF CLINICAL RESEARCH AND FUNDAMENTAL MEDICINE, WITH PATIENTS AND OTHER HUMAN SUBJECTS.  A CONTRACT FOR A MEDICAL EXPERT CONSULTANT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED TO CONTINUE THIS WORK, ADVISING THE DIO AND ORI DIRECTORS, AS WELL AS THE RESEARCH INTEGRITY BRANCH (RIB) OF THE OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL (OGC), ON THESE IMPORATANT CASES TO ORI.

STATEMENT OF WORK:

1.  PROVIDE EXPERTISE IN DESCRIBING FOR ORI THE NATURE OF THE DISEASES AND NORMAL MEDICAL CONDITION, THE TYPES OF RECORDS THAT SHOULD EXIST, AND AN ANALYSIS OF DISCREPANCIES IN THESE RECORDS, FROM A VIEWPOINT THAT RECOGNIZES THEIR MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE.

3.  CONDUCT HISTORICAL ANALYSES OF ORI’S CLINICAL CASES

4.  PREPARE PRESENTATIONS AND MANUSCRIPTS FOR PUBLICATION ON THIS RESEARCH.

SOLE SOURCE DETERMINATION IS BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING:

THE CONTRACTOR IS AN EXPERT IN MEDICINE, WHO IS STILL INVOLVED IN TEACHING MEDICAL STUDENTS AND MAINTAINS AN ACTIVE LICENSE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE.

THE RETIREMENT OF THE ONLY FULL-TIME M.D. EVER ON THE ORI STAFF IN ITS 13 YEARS OF EXISTENCE, HAS LEFT ORI UNABLE TO FIND A QUALIFIED FULL-TIME REPLACEMENT.  HOWEVER, THE CONTRACTOR, WHO HAD RETIRED FROM THE UNIFORMED SERVICES UNIVERSITY OF THE HEALTH SCIENCES IN BETHESDA AND FROM ACTIVE SERVICE AT THE WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL, BECAME AVAILABLE FOR PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT WITH ORI.  THE CONTRACTOR HAS MAINTAINED HIS MEDICAL LICENSE.PART-TIME ASSISTANCE IS A COST-EFFECTIVE STRATEGY FOR ORI TO OBTAIN THE REQUIRED MEDICAL EXPERTISE AND CLINICAL RESERACH MISCONDUCT EXPERIENCE NEEDED IN ORI.

IN ADDITION, THE CONTRACTOR HAS ADMINISTRATIVELY CLOSED 6 MAJOR CASEFILES INVOLVING CLINICAL RESEARCH, IN WHICH HE CONDUCTED EXPERT ANALYSES AND HE DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF SCIENTIFIC MISCONDUCT WITHIN ORI OR THE INSTITUTION TO PURSUE THE MATTERS FURTHER.

THE CONTRACTOR HAS ALSO GIVEN NUMEROUS TALKS FOR ORI AS MEDICAL EXPERT, AT BOTH ORI CONFERENCES AND AT HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WORKSHOPS ON HIS HANDLING OF RESEARCH MISCONDUCT CASES.   HE HAS PROVIDED CRITICAL EXPERT ADVICE TO OPHS, ORI, AND THE OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL ON THESE MATTERS.


THE PROPOSED CONTRACT WILL PROVIDE EXPERT MEDICAL CONSULTATION DURING ORI OVERSIGHT, GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT, AND ADVICE PROVISION TO RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS, HOSPITALS, AND MEDICAL ADMINISTRATORS WITHIN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OUTSIDE, ASSISTING ORI IN DETERMINING WHETHER RESEARCH MISCONDUCT MAY HAVE OCCURRED OR WHETHER THE ACCUSED SCIENTIST SHOULD BE EXONERATED.  IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE MATERIALS AND ASSISTANCE TO OTHERS TO DO SOME OF SUCH ANALYSES THEMSELVES.

THERE IS A COMPELLING NEED FOR THIS CONTRACT.  FABRICATION AND FALSIFICATION OF DATA AND MEDICAL RECORDS IS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE ALLEGATIONS OF RESEARCH MISCONDUCT ROUTINELY REVIEWED BY ORI.  EXPERT ANALYSIS IS CRITICAL TO THE ABILITY OF ORI TO ADEQUATELY ASSESS ALLEGATIONS AND INVESTIGATION REPORTS AND, IF MISCONDUCT IS FOUND, DEFEND THOSE FINDINGS IN APPEALS HEARINGS AND/OR IN CIVIL/CRIMINAL LITIGATION IN THE FEDERAL COURTS.  THE CONTRACT WILL PROVIDE THIS ANALYSIS FOR INDIVIDUAL CLINICAL CASES AND DEVELOP GUIDANCE. 

THE TYPE OF MEDICAL EXPERT IN RESEARCH MISCONDUCT CASE EXPERTISE REQUIRED BY ORI IS UNIQUE AND NOT AVAILABLE ELSEWHERE, ORI HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY OTHER SOURCES IN THE WASHINGTON, D.C. AREA.

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION IS FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT
INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE (FAR 6.302-1).  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT. CONTRACTORS MAY FORWARD CAPABILITY STATEMENTS TO THE REFERENCED ADDRESS.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Department of the Air Force Broad Agency Announcement FY05BAA100104

A. INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Force Protection Battlelab (AFFPB) mission is to identify innovative concepts for protecting Air Force personnel, facilities and weapon systems; rapidly measure the potential for advancing Air Force core competencies; and to explore joint warfighting by using field ingenuity, modeling, simulation, and actual employment of exploratory capabilities in operational environments.  The AFFPB invites solution based quad charts with rough-order-of-magnitude cost estimates that address Air Force Force Protection mission needs in the following areas:  Force Protection, Counterterrorism/Antiterrorism, and Force Health Protection. This BAA is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals. Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, “The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.” A secure website has been established to provide public access to the BAA package, collect unclassified submittals, and track classified submittals. All submitters responding to this BAA are required to register at the secure BAA Information Delivery System (BIDS) website https://bids.acqcenter.com/affpb. Click on “register” under the “account center” heading. The submitter must complete all mandatory fields on the BIDS submitter registration form. BIDS submitter registrations are automatically accepted and the acceptance e-mail will provide the registrant’s username that will be used at the BIDS website and placed in the quad charts and white papers as described in paragraph D and E below. Questions regarding BIDS may be addressed via e-mail to the BIDS help desk at bidshelp@acqcenter.com or by accessing HELP REQUEST at the bottom of the BIDS site screen. BIDS help requests shall reference FY05BAA100104.  This announcement is open through 30 September 2005.  Solution Based quad charts in response to this announcement may be submitted at any time during this period. This is a two phase process: Phase 1 will be a review of quad charts submitted under this BAA; Phase 2 will be a review of five page white papers submitted at the request of the Air Force Force Protection Battlelab based on the quad chart review.  A new BAA may be posted following expiration of this submittal period in support of any additional or continuing agency needs.
 
B. OBJECTIVE:  
(1) Technical Description: This BAA solicits innovative quad charts addressing solutions to identified Air Force Force Protection needs. The Force Protection Battlelab has divided its focus into three distinct areas: force health protection, counterterrorism/antiterrorism, and force protection.  This broad agency announcement is only looking for concepts that fall within these three areas.  Submit quad charts that address:  Force Protection, Counterterrorism/Antiterrorism, and Force Health Protection Force.  
Subgroup Description	Subgroup/Requirement Designator
Force Health Protection 	FHP-100
Counterterrorism/Antiterrorism	CTAT-200
Force Protection 	FP-300

a.  Force Health Protection (FHP-100) - Force Health Protection is defined as all services performed, provided, or arranged by the Services to promote, improve, conserve, or restore the physical well-being of personnel.  The Force Health Protection subgroup focuses on concepts to improve:
§	Preventive and curative health measures; evacuation of the wounded, injured or sick; selection of the medically fit and disposition of the medically unfit
§	Blood management and immunization methodologies
§	Field expedient first aid, hemorrhage control, emergency wound treatment, management of fractures and treatment of burns
§	Processes to address injuries resulting from nuclear, biological, chemical, radiological and conventional weapons
§	Personnel training, insertion of capability at the point of need, interoperability with other service and civilian assets
§	Medical surveillance of non-battle injuries and illnesses, endemic infectious diseases and exposure to nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons or materials.
§	Methods for decontamination of personnel and equipment
§	Medical first responder communications and reachback/reachforward capabilities.  
Specific areas of interest in the area of Force Health Protection can be viewed in the Other Downloads section at https://bids.acqcenter.com/affpb. 

b.  Counterterrorism/Antiterrorism (CTAT-200) - Counterterrorism is defined as offensive measures taken to prevent, deter, and respond to terrorism.  Antiterrorism is defined as defensive measures used to reduce the vulnerability of individuals and property to terrorist acts, to include limited response and containment by local military forces.  While this area of interest applies to military it also focuses on solution sets that would apply to homeland security and homeland defense.  The Counterterrorism/Antiterrorism subgroup focuses on identifying concepts to improve:
§	Security of personnel, assets and facilities
§	Prevention of unauthorized access to equipment, installations, and material
§	Vulnerability assessments; command and control; training and equipment for first responders; personnel and vehicle access control; biometric identification devices
§	Law enforcement operations
§	Intelligence operations as they apply to terrorist threats.  This includes the collection, analysis, and dissemination of all forms of available intelligence.
Specific areas of interest in the area of Counterterrorism/Antiterrorism can be viewed in the Other Downloads section at https://bids.acqcenter.com/affpb.
c.  Force Protection (FP-300) - Force Protection is defined as actions taken to prevent or mitigate hostile actions against Department of Defense personnel (to include family members), resources, facilities, and critical information.  These actions conserve the force's fighting potential so it can be applied at the decisive time and place and incorporate the coordinated and synchronized offensive and defensive measures to enable the effective employment of the joint force while degrading opportunities for the enemy.  The Force Protection subgroup focuses on concepts to improve:
§	Methods or tools to improve emergency response operations  
§	Methods or tools to improve explosive ordnance disposal operations, to include locating, reconnoitering, accessing, identifying, rendering safe, removing, and disposing of large and small quantities of unexploded ordnance 
§	Ability of personnel to operate in a Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) environment 
§	Methods or tools to increase the resistance of buildings, shelters, and areas to terrorist attacks
§	Methods or tools to improve the physical security of installations worldwide
§	Methods for the NBC agent detection, identification, and warning
Specific areas of interest in the area of Force Protection can be viewed in the Other Downloads section at https://bids.acqcenter.com/affpb.
(2) Security Requirements: Every precaution must be taken to protect potentially sensitive or classified material. Such material should not be transmitted across open-source media like public phone, fax, internet, or email. If a submitter has any reason to believe their concept may reference ideas or operations that require special protection, the submitter should immediately contact our security office. Please call (210) 925-5055, or E-mail affpbsolutions@lackland.af.mil for any security concerns regarding white paper submissions. Specific laws and regulations directing the proper methods for transmission of classified submittals may bind submitters who are supported by an accredited security office.
(3) Other Special Requirements:
a.  DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME. ONLY QUAD CHARTS ARE TO BE SUBMITTED.
b.  Successful offerors must comply with the Privacy Act.
c.  Offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the government to an award under this BAA.
C. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Submitters are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Number and reference BAA number FY05BAA100104 with their submissions.  Submitters are reminded that they must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov to conduct business with the Government.  Integrated Data Systems (IDS) of Chantilly, VA, the administrators of the BIDS software tool that will be used to submit and evaluate BAA responses, will view submittals only when absolutely necessary to perform their duties. All submitters will be required to agree that IDS personnel can view their submittal if necessary to help a submitter or evaluator with the BIDS software tool. All IDS personnel who may view your submittal have signed non-disclosure agreements with the government. IDS will not be evaluating submittals.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to apply.  
 
Notice to Foreign Owned Firms: Such firms are asked to immediately notify the Air Force point of contact, USAF FPB/CCD, (210) 925-1497 or e-mail affpbsolutions@lackland.af.mil upon deciding to respond to this announcement. Foreign contractors shall be aware that restrictions may apply which could preclude their participation in this announcement.

D. QUAD CHART PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS: The cost of preparing quad charts in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18. Every effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of the quad chart and any evaluations. Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or proposals are not desired. The purpose of the quad chart is to preclude effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  Following an evaluation of the initial quad chart, the submitter will be advised whether the quad chart will be accepted for further review or eliminated from further consideration. If the submittal was eliminated, feedback will be provided to the submitter. If the submittal is accepted, the submitter will be so advised and a five-page white paper will be requested. Formal requests for proposal, issued by a duly appointed contracting officer, will be issued if/when funds become available.
(1)	All quad chart submittals must strictly follow the instructions in this announcement to avoid delays in evaluation or disqualification.
(2)	All unclassified quad charts shall be uploaded to BIDS at http://bids.acqcenter.com/affpb in Microsoft Powerpoint or Adobe PDF electronic file format and each must include all information requested in this BAA. BIDS will display a submission checklist that summarizes this information.
(3)	Quad charts submitted under this BAA will be formatted as follows:  The Title Section of the quad chart will include the BAA Number: Subgroup Area; Requirement Number; Proposal Title.  The upper left quadrant of the quad chart will be used to graphically depict the proposed concept or solution.  The upper right quadrant of the quad chart will have a header entitled Operational Capability.  This quadrant will be used to provide a description (textual) of the operational capability.  The lower left quadrant of the quad chart will have a header entitled Proposed Technical Approach.  This quadrant will be used to detail the technical approach and can be broken down into tasks or phases.  The lower right quadrant of the quad chart will have three headers: (1) Rough Order of Magnitude Cost and Schedule; (2) Deliverables; and (3) Corporate Information.  Under the Rough Order of Magnitude Cost and Schedule header, identify each task or phase, listed in the Proposed Technical Solution section, and provide the estimated duration and estimated cost.  Under the Deliverables header, identify the deliverables that will result from the project.  Under Corporate Information provide the company/organization name, point of contact, telephone number and e-mail address.  A sample quad chart is uploaded with this synopsis.
(4) All data uploaded to BIDS is secure from public view or download. All submissions will be considered proprietary/source selection sensitive and protected accordingly.  Uploaded documents can only be reviewed by the submitter, authorized Government representatives, assigned evaluators, and administrators of the BIDS tool (only if required to perform their duties). 
(5) Changes to uploaded responses are not possible because evaluation of submittals begins immediately.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command has a requirement for depot-level support of the CFM56-2A-2 engine for the E-6B program.  The CFM56-2A-2 is a General Electric/SNECMA (CFM International) commercial engine.  The E-6B has four CFM56-2A-2 engines on each of the 16 aircraft.  The proposed procurement will be a Performance Based Logistics (PBL) strategy.  The contractor will provide complete depot-level engine maintenance to support the needs of the entire E-6B fleet, 75 engines total (64 on-wing/11 spares) and total integrated logistics support including the provision of all spare engines, asset repair management (spares and consumables), obsolescence management, reliability and maintainability management, configuration management, commercial technology insertion, transportation, sustaining engineering (SE) and any other innovative supply support solutions plus the labor necessary for such maintenance.  Use of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) certified parts and components will be required.  Based on current flight hour projections, the anticipated scheduled maintenance for additional workload will be one engine in FY08, nine engines in FY09, four engines in FY10, four engines in FY11, five engines in FY12, three engines in FY13, six engines in FY14, seven engines in FY15 and six engines in FY16.  The anticipated unscheduled maintenance workload is four engines per year for the life of the contract.  This is subject to change since forecasting for unscheduled maintenance is based on historical data.

It is anticipated that the contractor will be accountable for maintaining the entire inventory throughout the duration of the contract and that the contractor will be held to the availability metrics in the contract, such as:

„h	Engine Availability
o	24-hours delivery to STRATCOMWINGONE, Tinker AFB with required SE
o	Four War Reserve engines available to STRATCOMMWINGONE at all times
„h	Turn Around Time
o	24-hours for War Reserve engine replacement
„h	Engine Reliability
o	3,400 Cycles Scheduled Maintenance
o	1,750 Cycles Unscheduled Maintenance

A Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) would be beneficial for budgetary purposes.  Additionally any respondent should provide information that supports their qualifications for this effort.  The Navy is also interested in any and all companies that would like to hold a site tour at their facilities.  AT THIS TIME, NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information for planning purposes.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  The intent of this RFI is to assist the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in conducting market research to identify potential sources to retrofit its fleet of nine C-40A aircraft with advanced blended winglets.  The C-40A is a Boeing 737-700C in the Increased Gross Weight (IGW) configuration with an –800 series wing.  The USN airplanes are covered by line numbers 496-1849.  Four of our airplanes were constructed before line number 778 (un-ballasted wing structure) and may require additional effort for certification.  The C-40A is operated in three distinct configurations: all-passenger, all-cargo and Combi (70 pax, 3 pallets).  The installation of the winglets shall be Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified by Supplemental Type Certificate.  The winglets shall provide a minimum overall block fuel savings of 3-4% over the current configuration without winglets.  The winglet installation shall also provide improvements in climb gradient, optimum cruise altitude and a reduction in exhaust emissions.  Range on long missions (over 2000 NM) with a nominal cargo load of 5000 lbs shall improve a minimum of 130 NM.

Responses to this RFI must reference the sources sought number and title, should be limited to a total of ten pages, and include: 

1) Brief statement of interest/capabilities

2) A Rough Order of Magnitude estimate of non-recurring costs

3) A Rough Order of Magnitude estimate of recurring costs

4) Notional schedule estimates for installation

5) Technical feasibility alternatives assessment 

6) Special considerations that might reduce the associated cost or risk of time delays

7) FAA certification process

8) Any other information at vendor discretion such as catalogs, drawings/illustrations, technical manuals, training description/material, warranty, testing documentation, brochures and/or any other documentation that describes the capability to design, develop, manufacture and support an effort of the type described herein.
 
9) Respondents should identify any government and/or commercial customers to whom the same or similar winglet installations have been done.  Provide customer point of contact, including a telephone number, e-mail address or web site, quantities sold along with dates sold, and a description.

10) All responses submitted must specify, on the cover page of the response or in the transmittal letter submitted with the response, the business size/status of the organization (i.e., large business, small business, certified 8(a) concern, veteran-owned, hubzone, women-owned, etc.).     Small businesses who possess the required capability are encouraged to submit responses to this notice.

Questions pertaining to this notice may be emailed to the contract specialist at leann.warner@navy.mil.  The deadline for submission of questions concerning this notice is 4:30 PM EST on 20 June 2005.  The responses to all questions received by this date will be posted at http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/  .

<DESC>SUBJECT: Aeromedical Evacuation Mattress, Litter

The Human Systems Group is seeking information from sources that are capable of providing an Aeromedical Evacuation Litter Mattress to replace the existing Litter Mattress (NSN 6530-01-504-9783).  This device must be able to be used within the aero medical evacuation system.

The instrument should have as a minimum the following capabilities:

1. Optimal mattress pad dimensions shall be 73” long by 23”  wide. The thickness of the mattress and cover shall be determined by the efficiency of the materials to effectively distribute the weight of a patient up to 250lbs. Mattress will not exceed 3” in thickness.    

2. The products overall weight should not exceed 6lbs. 

3. The mattress should distribute the weight of the patient with the goal of pressure wound prevention and promote healing of any pre-existing wounds. The USAF will conduct pressure testing to confirm the distribution of weight by the mattress.

4. The mattress shall provide comfort to litter bound patients while reducing pressure on body surface areas prone to pressure ulcerations.  

a.)The exterior pad surface shall be compliant with current infection control disinfection standards.  The surface and seams shall be impermeable to fluids, dust and sand. The exterior surface shall be slip-inhibiting on at least one side.  

b.)The exterior surface shall be low shear and low friction in accordance with generally accepted wound care prevention standards.

c.)The product shall be tear, mildew, rot, abrasion and ultraviolet light resistant. 

5. The product shall meet flammability requirements established by the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 25.853 (a) Appendix F, Part I (a) (1) (ii). 

6. The external surface of the pad will allow for ambient airspace volume changes. The mattress will passively adjust to changes in altitude without operator intervention and compensate for a rapid increase in volume. During an in-flight rapid decompression the expansion in air volume will not harm the patient. The manufacturer will incorporate an acceptable venting mechanism to compensate for rapid expansion of air volume.  The venting mechanism will maintain impermeability of the mattress. The mattress will be tested by the USAF in a high altitude chamber to 15,000 feet above sea level. The mattress will be subjected to a rapid decompression to 45,000 feet above sea level.  (See URL:  http://www.tdsway.com/products/recon/hardware_test_standards/MIL-STD-810F_500.4 ) 


7. The exterior surface of the pad shall be subdued in color, non-reflective mat finish.  

8. The exterior surface shall not generate static electricity. The mattress will not be an electrical conducting surface and will be safe to use with defibrillators. 

9. Will withstand exposure to humidity levels from 5% to 95%.

10.The product shall recover after being subjected to high temperature storage IAW MIL-STD-810F, Method 501.4.  (See URL:  http://www.tdsway.com/products/recon/hardware_test_standards/MIL-STD-810F_501.4 )

11.The product shall recover after being subjected to low temperature storage IAW MIL-STD-810F, Method 502.4.  (See URL: http://www.tdsway.com/products/recon/hardware_test_standards/MIL-STD-810F_502.4 )

<SUBJECT>46 -- Energy Efficient Brackish Ground Water and Produced Water Desalination
<DESC>Sandia is soliciting expressions of interest from potential partners to further develop and/or commercialize the technologies shown below.  Partnerships are anticipated to take the form of Cooperative Research & Development Agreements (CRADA) and/or commercial licenses.  CRADAs are expected to include funds-in to the Labs and licensed rights may be up to exclusive in a field-of-use, depending on the business case.  Sandia is seeking partners that have proven experience in translating immature technologies into market-driven products, have technical capabilities in the technical area(s) shown below, are fiscally sound and well managed, and can commit to manufacturing the products in the U.S.    

Energy Efficient Brackish Ground Water and Produced Water Desalination   This technology presents an entirely new approach to desalination of inland ground, primarily brackish water as well as desalting/demineralizing of produced waters (i.e., Coal bed methane produced water) found in the oil and gas industry, and is based on in-situ precipitation, ion exchange and precipitation of inorganic phases able to sequester the major ionic constituents of brackish water and conventional impurities in natural gas and oil. The resultant ion exchange material would contain the removed ions and therefore would require non-toxic waste removal. These wastes can either be recycled, safely deposited in landfills without salt leaching, or used as a sellable building materials (incorporated for example into cement). Furthermore, it is applicable to remote locations of oil and/or natural gas wells that pump highly mineralized waters along with the gas.  By employing this technology, an operator is not required to run energy lines or build large power plants (generally associated with RO desalination processes); nor are they required to further treat or transport produced brackish water away from the site.  Employing this technology allows for inexpensive, on-site water treatment and disposal.  A patent is pending for this technology.

Novel Family of Zeolites for Selective Heavy Metal and/or Radioactive Cation Removal   The new class of molecular sieves named Sandia Octahedral Molecular Sieves (SOMS) has been synthesized, characterized and tested for the removal of aqueous divalent cations, in particular dissolved heavy metals (i.e., Co2+, Zn2+, Cd2+) and radioactive cations (i.e., Sr2+, Ba2+).  These materials were originally developed for remediation of waste materials in storage tanks, but can also be easily applied to the mining and chemical industries. They have been shown to have very high selectivity for cations of choice and maintain high selectivity over the entire pH range.  Recently, Sandia has applied for a patent for a synthetic procedure for the synthesis of these materials that utilizes oxide based reactants, resulting in an inexpensive and easily-scaleable synthetic procedure that is expected to have broad industry applications. Patents have been awarded and additional patents are pending for this technology.

Ultra Sensitive Acoustic Motion Detector   Utilizing the combination of Vertical Cavity Surface-emitting Lasers (VCSELs) and MEMS, devices can be fabricated to serve as inexpensive, highly sensitive sensors with applications in a variety of markets.  Fabricated of polysilicon materials, two tiny comb-like structures (instead of fingers) are laid one over each other. The bottom comb is locked rigidly in place. The top comb is secured only by horizontal springs. Any tiny motion sends the top comb skittering over the bottom comb, laterally deforming the grating. A small laser in the visible to near-infrared range, focused on the apparatus enables the detection of very small lateral displacements. This measuring device is in effect a kind of accelerometer, about the size of a MEMS device.  Mass manufacturing by the same foundry processes as conventional silicon chips (both the laser and the MEMS devices) is expected to yield low cost products.   Patents are pending for this technology.

Specific Anion Nanoengineered Sorbents (SANS)  SANS is a simple and cost effective set of nanoengineered materials for the removal of arsenic contamination in drinking water. This new class of materials provides inexpensive and effective removal of anionic contaminants from drinking water and wastewater, without requiring costly pH adjustment. SANS media can be used in both granular filter bed and coagulation/micro filtration water treatment systems, and can be disposed as nonhazardous waste. The SANS materials will allow both rural and municipal water systems of varying water usage to meet the new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) arsenic drinking water standard of 10 parts per billion. SANS materials have been tested in laboratory batch and column tests, where they have surpassed the capacity and effectiveness of commercially available arsenic sorbent or coagulation materials. SANS has been evaluated as both solid granules and as surface coatings on inexpensive substrates. The latter application is a means to produce very inexpensive, but effective, arsenic sorbents. Both sorbent media and coagulation/micro filtration technologies can be adapted for use in many water utility systems, thereby significantly reducing water utility compliance costs for the new EPA standard. Additional laboratory tests demonstrate that SANS media can be used for treatment of other regulated anionic contaminants, such as chromate, perchlorate or pertechnetate. Further technical information about SANS materials may be found at the following website: http://www.sandia.gov/eesector/gs/gc/SANS/index.htm.  Patents have been awarded and additional patents are pending for this technology.

<SUBJECT>A -- DARPA Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) Common Operating System (COS) Industry Day
<DESC>The DARPA Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) Office is hosting an Industry Day on June 24, 2005.  This forum will present an overview of the consortium business arrangement for the development of the J-UCAS “Common Operating System” (COS) and specifically the needs for technology contributions throughout the development of the COS.  J-UCAS Overview:  The Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program is a joint DARPA/Air Force/Navy effort to demonstrate the technical feasibility, military utility and operational value for a networked system of high performance, weaponized unmanned air vehicles to effectively and affordably prosecute 21st century combat missions, including Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD), surveillance, and precision strike within the emerging global command and control architecture. The J-UCAS office is currently managing two air vehicle development programs, the X-45 (Boeing), and the X-47 (Northrop Grumman).  The COS is the software and the algorithms that provide for command and control, communications management, mission planning, much of the interactive autonomy, the human systems interface and the many other qualities associated with each of these.  Consortium Overview:  In order to accomplish the development of the COS, the J-UCAS program office is employing a unique business structure.  This structure includes a consortium consisting of the program primes (Boeing and Northrop Grumman), and Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory as the integrator/broker. Program primes are key stakeholders that directly contribute software functionality to the COS and are exclusively responsible for integrating the COS onto their own platform.  The integrator/broker facilitates and coordinates the COS integration process amongst the primes and other technology providers and, if necessary, will act as DARPA's trusted agent in completing the development of enterprise architecture and COS.  Technology contributors provide “best of breed” algorithms to the COS.  Their involvement in the consortium is based on the specific potential contributions that may enhance the COS functionality.  Technology providers can include small developers, other large defense contractors, as well as traditional sub-contractors.  This Industry Day will provide an opportunity for DARPA and the Consortium to brief COS plans and Technology Opportunities to industry.  Additionally, DARPA will discuss goals with industry and conduct one-on-one dialogue with potential offerors.  At this point in time, organizations specializing in Human Systems Interface are strongly encouraged to attend as there is an opportunity to fill an immediate need in the COS development. The Industry Day will be conducted on 24 June 2005 at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory Kossiakoff Center, 11100 Johns Hopkins Road, Laurel, MD 20723-6099.     Directions and lodging options can be found at http://www.jhuapl.edu.   Attendees should plan to arrive between 0830 and 0900.  Industry Day will begin at 0900 and briefings will continue through 1200.  Lunch will be made available between 1200 and 1300 after which written questions may be answered.  Questions left unanswered may be answered and made available via the web at a later date. One-one-one meetings with potential offerors will be conducted from 1330-1700 in 30 minute segments.  If more one-on-one meetings are requested than time allows, additional meetings will be scheduled at a later date.  Attendance at Industry Day is limited to a maximum of 2 individuals per organization.  Clearances are not required and all discussions will be unclassified.  Please note that Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory personnel will be in attendance during the one-on-one meetings. This announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind.     The Government will NOT assume liability for costs incurred by an offeror for travel expenses, presentations, marketing efforts or data offered for examination; therefore the cost of preparing information in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.  Registration for the Industry Day can be made on-line starting Wednesday June 8th at http://www.jhuapl.edu/j-ucas.  A $20 registration fee will be required and will be collected at the entrance to the Kossiakoff Center.  Technical questions can be directed to Marc Pitarys, COS Program Manager, at mpitarys@darpa.mil.  Business questions can be directed to Mark Bennington, J-UCAS Agreements Officer at (703) 696-2411.

<DESC>THE FOLLOWING SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION IS A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 19.5. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation Request for Quotes (RFQ) pursuant to FAR 12.603 Streamlined Solicitation for Commercial Items for Census in Schools Support; NAICS Code: 611710 Education Support Services with a Size Standard of $6.0 M.  The U.S. Census Bureau’s Census 2000 Publicity Office developed and designed the Census in Schools project for Census 2000 with Scholastic, Inc, a large educational publishing company.  The project’s goal was to promote participation in Census 2000 while supporting standard curriculum requirements.  Educators were invited to participate in the project and were provided with interactive lesson plans and other materials to help students understand the importance and benefits of the census, promote awareness, encourage greater participation in the national census, and improve the overall accuracy of Census 2000.  Prior to the 1990 Census, the Census Bureau developed a similar set of instructional materials.  Educators from across the country helped the Census Bureau craft a teaching package which contained an excellent set of instructional materials to help students understand the importance and benefits of the census, promote awareness, encourage greater participation of the census, etc. One of the criticisms of the Census in Schools project for Census 2000 was that materials were not developed and distributed early enough to get endorsements and support from educational leaders and education associations.  Therefore, the Census Bureau would like to begin the process earlier to develop the core set of the educational materials. The contractor shall facilitate a process to work with educators to develop draft standards-based K-12 teaching package for the 2010 Census.  The contractor shall provide (with input from the agency) educators and consultants to create the concepts and lessons plans for the teaching package. The contractor shall also select and ensure participation of educators to review and pilot-test the final draft of the K-12 teaching package. The draft teaching package should be developed for review during the 2005-2006 school year.  The contractor shall propose, as part of its technical plan, appropriate methodologies and approaches, AS WELL AS DELIVERABLES, for accomplishing these objectives. The Performance Objectives are: 1) Formulate Participant Criteria, 2) Venue for Curriculum Development Meeting, 3) Education Consultants, 4) Travel Arrangements, 5) Meeting Facilitation, 6) Resource Room, and 7) Educators Review, with OPTIONAL 9) Educator Review Analysis. The period of performance is approximately 18 months from date of award. Evaluation of Offers shall be done pursuant to FAR 12.602 Streamlined Evaluation of Offers. Technical Evaluation Factors are, in order of descending importance: 1) Technical Approach, 2) Past Performance and Capability. Selection will be done on a best-value basis, with technical factors weighted more than price. The deadline for any technical questions is no later than June 14, 2005, 3:00 PM Eastern Time. Submit all technical questions in writing via email to jonathan.c.hamlet@census.gov. The Government reserves the right to reject any offers that do not follow the terms and conditions of this synopsis/solicitation. FOR A FULL COPY OF THE STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES, QUOTE INSTRUCTIONS, AND EVALUATION CRITERIA, VISIT HTTP://WWW.CENSUS.GOV/PROCUR/WWW/SCHOOLS/INDEX.HTML. All quotes must be submitted both electronically to jonathan.c.hamlet@census.gov along with four (4) hard copies mailed by regular U.S. mail to U.S. Census Bureau, Acquisition Branch, Room G-312-3, 4700 Silver Hill Rd, Washington, DC 20233 (if express mail or hand delivery is used replace Washington, DC 20233 with Suitland, MD 20746) in SEPARATE TECHNICAL AND PRICE VOLUMES NO LATER THAN June 27, 2005, 12:00 PM Eastern Time.

STATEMENT OF WORK

Farrier Services
Douglas Station Mounted Horse Patrol Unit

The Mounted Horse Patrol Unit of the Douglas Station currently has twenty-one (21) horses assigned to it.  As such, caring for the horses, maintaining the facilities and having agents available for farrier services has become very expensive and taxing on the unit’s ability to maintain the maximum number of agents in the field to perform their official duties. 

The station does not currently have a designated or contracted farrier to provide shoeing for the horses in the remuda.  Employing a contractor would eliminate the need for the unit supervisor to seek out a farrier every five to eight weeks to shoe the station’s horses.  A contract farrier would be held accountable for a guarantied work product whereas a non-contract farrier limits his work to a very limited guaranty and would most likely charge a mileage fee to refit a shoe.  A disadvantage noted in soliciting a different farrier every shoeing cycle is that the farrier does not have the opportunity to “learn” each horse and become familiar with its shoeing needs.  This lends itself to many an animal becoming lame, thus being placed out of service until it heals.  Some injuries due to lameness can permanently disable an animal, costing the agency in veterinary services and ultimately having to replace the animal.

The advantages to having a contract farrier is that he/she would become familiar with each of the animals and have an understanding of each of their shoeing needs.  A contract farrier would be required to comply with standards established by the agency or risk losing the contract award.

A contractor would be responsible for providing all labor, supervision, equipment, supplies, training, and transportation in order to provide services at a specified site. 

The following are minimum requirements for farrier services:

Farrier:

·	Shoe horses every five to eight weeks by certified farrier. (Farrier should possess a certificate from a recognized Farrier Training Facility)

·	If  a shoe is lost – replacement will be in a timely manner (within 24 hours)

·	The farrier shall perform his/her work between the hours of 7:00am – 5:00pm, Monday through Friday.

·	Shall correct any discrepancies noted, as directed by the COTR, within a three day period after receipt of services at no additional cost to the Government

·	Shall maintain an approved Hoof Management and Maintenance Schedule (Final approval on any maintenance schedule shall be approved by the unit supervisor.)

·	Shall have a minimum of three years experience at a journeyman level and be in compliance with all applicable state and local regulations

Note:
(1)	Vendor is responsible for any costs or damages suffered to the Government (i.e. veterinary costs, etc) that is a result of negligence within a two-day period after Farrier service. The COTR and the Contracting Officer will determine negligence.

(2)	Locations may be changed, added or deleted throughout the contract period.

Each offeror must submit a proposal in accordance with the instructions herein.  Proposals must respond to and meet all of the mandatory requirements of this solicitation.  Failure to meet any mandatory requirement may be cause for rejection of an offer without further consideration.  When evaluating an offeror, the Government will consider how well the offeror complied with both the letter and intent of these instructions.

<DESC>The following question was received in response to the synopsis/solicitation released on May 26, 2005: (1)The solicitation states that, “the contractor will be required to have expertise in and experience with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in securing waivers for USSS chartered aircraft to violate Flight Restriction Airspace Zones in the Washington D.C. area and any other flight restricted zone throughout the United States.”, and, “the contractor will also be required to have expertise and experience with the White House Travel Office in coordinating charter aircraft services between the White House and the United States Secret Service.” The references to having experience performing these specific tasks for the USSS indicates that only an incumbent or contractor that has held this contract in the past will satisfy the solicitation requirements. This language seriously restricts the competitive field. Was it the intent of the USSS to limit competition in this way or to allow other qualified bidders who have experience in working with the TSA, White House and USSS to bid in this contract? Response:  The solicitation language is revised as follows: The contractor will be required to have expertise with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in securing waivers for Federal Government chartered aircraft services. 

The contracotr will also be required to have expertise and experience with coordinating charter aircraft services between multiple agencies within the federal government.

Please note, for evaluation of past performance, the offeror must provide at least three references for contracts/purchase orders of similar services within the last two (2) years. Each reference must include customer's name and address, contact person, project name, date of performance, telephone number and contract value for each reference. If business entity establishment is less than two (2) years, provide related experience of key personnel. Past Performance shall be valued as acceptable or unacceptable. 
The due date for proposals is extended through to Tuesday, June 14, 2005 at 4:00pm.  Proposals may be submitted via facsimile to 202-406-6801 or via email to Patricia.Kiely@usss.dhs.gov.

Technical Capability Evaluation Criteria: Your technical capabilities, as demonstrated in both the written technical quotation, will be evaluated to determine your understanding and proven ability to provide the storage units as specified, maintain adequate stock and meet customer demands.  
Past Performance Evaluation Criterion: The following factor will be considered in evaluating the offeror’s past performance: demonstrated record (as confirmed by references) of successful past performance of the same or similar projects of this scope on time within budget.

Discounts from the contractor’s catalog or market publication prices must be clearly stated.

Proposed pricing will be evaluated to determine whether they are necessary and reasonable for the conduct of the proposed future delivery orders or purchase card orders, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the methods of performance described in the offeror’s proposal.  Price proposals will not be compared against each firm to determine the best price.  Best value, in regards to superior technical proposals, will determine at what proposed and realistic cost will TSA award the contractor.	 

Special Notes:  For issued delivery orders, payment via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) for each task will occur upon final acceptance of each deliverable and submission of a proper invoice.  Payment shall occur in US dollars.

The offeror must be capable of providing the supplies listed and delivered to the various locations. 
Offerors are requested to demonstrate their expertise through a written quotation.  The written response to this RFP must be in two separate volumes.  Volume 1 for the submission must not exceed three pages and provide your firm’s capability statement and past performance references to provide for TSA wide deployment of the storage units.

I.	 STATEMENT OF WORK

INTRODUCTION

The Office of Democracy and Governance (DCHA/DG) is one of the larger offices of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance Bureau (DCHA/DG). DCHA/DG has a staff of 73 including direct hires and others.  It is the successor office of the Center for Democracy and Governance that was created in 1994 to provide technical support and guidance to USAID, especially to field missions. DCHA/DG also has an important directive, as did the old Center, to train and strengthen the Agency’s cadre of democracy officers. The Office is also charged with managing three congressionally mandated funds grouped together under the rubric of Special Programs to Address the Needs of Survivors (SPANS). 

The DG Office consists of:  Rule of Law, Elections and Political Processes; Civil Society; and Governance Division - a Strategies Division; a Program and Information Team, and a SPANS team.  The Strategies Division coordinates the DG Office’s backstopping of field missions and regional bureaus, and works with these operating units to improve the quality of their democratic governance activities. The Program Division also reviews democracy and governance programs to learn from past experiences with a view to improving the Agency’s know-how in program design and implementation.  The subject position will likely start within, but not necessarily be limited to, a new, crisis stabilization unit; responsibilities will be geographically “world-wide,” varied and dynamic, to reflect changing circumstances facing USAID, the DG office, as well as any changing composition of the team.

As a technical office in a pillar bureau, DCHA/DG has also been given the task of being prepared to respond quickly to the failure of governance in weak states such as the collapse of the state in Afghanistan and Iraq. In such situations, technical assistance by DCHA/DG for the timely and punctuated interventions is critical. By definition a failed state is one without governance. For this reason the DG Office, plans to hire one U.S. citizen personal services contractor (USPSC) to be available to deploy to provide fast and flexible assistance targeted at the restoration or establishment of democratic governance. The deployment will be to the affected country and can last from several weeks to as long as one year. When not deployed the PSC's will be integrated into the regular DCHA/DG staff and will work under the direction of the division or team leader/Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) to which they are assigned by the DG Office Director. 

For more information about DCHA/DG and its activities, please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/democracy_and_governance.


DECISION MAKING--DCHA/DG requires a Senior DG Field Advisor that is considered an expert that has been consulted by other experts and who can perform under general administrative discretion with wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment, work of outstanding difficulty and responsibility; and has formal decision making authority in broad area of democratic governance activities. The position demands mastery of specialization but assignments are complicated by interconnected issues, multi-disciplinary approaches, conflicts among possible technical solutions, etc.  Assignments reflect wide program area; projects range from regional to national impacting the area that an individual with high level managerial and operational skills, and is available to be sent out quickly to perform specific advisory and supervisory functions in the field. As with other DCHA/DG technical staff, the advisor will do occasional TDYs to USAID field missions.
