This shall include the de sign, fabrication, installation, documentation, training, and transportation associated with converting the current front-mounted VAMIDS array into a side-mounted array to be attached to the LION II vehicle owned by HD.

A side-mounted VAMIDS array eliminates thi s risk.  The duration of this effort is 4 months.   The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  However, all respon sible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully provide the above modifications and enhancements to the VAMIDS system may submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to place a contract with Technical Consultants, Inc. Marshall, TX. (TCI) for an unsolicited proposal to provide multi-phase effort using a remotely operated twin-screw mixer/extruder to continuously extrude the current tri-services infrared decoy flare directly into the final complex pellet grain geometries. The tri-services infrared decoy flares currently utilized two different binders in the formulations. The Navy flares utilize a fluoroelastomer binder and the Army/Air Force flares use a polyacrylate binder, the differences in the formulations require that both binders be demonstrated in the remote processing facility. The infrared decoy flares used as the test vehicle to demonstrate this effort are the M-206 configuration for the US Army/US Air Force flares and the MJU-38 configuration for the Navy flares. TCI personnel being the first to process pyrotechnic compositions via this technology. TCI’s knowledge of batch and continuous manufacturing processes coupled with safety and risk assessments, makes TCI the only company that can readily execute a program for twin-screw extrusion of infrared (IR) decoy flares directly into the final grain configuration. No solicitation or document is available and no contract will be awarded solely upon the basis of information submitted in response to this synopsis. See Note 22

These services will support White Sands Missile Range, Holloman AFB, White Sands Test Facility (NASA) and Ft. Bliss.  Our wireless communications requirements include wireless Internet, cellular telephone, and pager services.  An additional requirement cal ls for 2-way radio functions to be integrated on cellular telephone devices to work alongside, and in conjunction with, existing radio trunking services.  The current Radio Trunking System (RTS) is largely utilized for mission support, and range safety (po lice, security, and fire department).  However, a lot of traffic on the RTS is administrative in nature, and can cause overloading of individual repeater sites.  It is the intent of this effort to augment the existing RTS by moving the administrative users  to the new wireless system.   These requirements provide for the most efficient and cost effective means to support the mission of our organizations.  Nextel Communications is the only commercial provider that integrates the 2-way radio functions with cel lular telephone services.  The Federal Communications Commission has classified Nextel Communications as an Enhanced Specialized Mobile Radio provider.  The digital integrated services that Nextel provides include: dispatch (private and group), mobile phon es, alphanumeric paging with acknowledgement, and voice mail.  All of these services are accessed on one unit.  See Note 22 (any other interested parties must respond by 07 Mar 2003 at 1600 hours of this notification).

<DESC>INTRODUCTION. The Division of Ocean Sciences, National Science Foundation is seeking a System Integration Contractor (SIC) to provide non-riser drilling ship capability and associated scientific support for the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP).  This will be a successor to the Ocean Drilling Program contract between NSF and Joint Oceanographic Institutions, Inc.  Budget constraints dictate a two-phased approach to the program effort.  Phase 1 will support the contractor to provide an acceptable vessel capable of scientific drilling operations for the initial program years beginning in mid 2004 without significant government supported modifications.  Phase 2 will require the contractor to acquire and convert a vessel to the enhanced scientific ocean drilling capability that has been identified by the scientific ocean drilling community. An international scientific advisory committee is reviewing proposals for specific drilling projects to be addressed during Phase 1. Information on these proposals can be found at  (www.isas-office.jp/ ).  Prioritization of these proposals is expected to occur in September 2003 and will be used in developing the Phase 1 drilling schedule. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS. The SIC will manage the selection, acquisition, and operation of the Phase 1 vessel, and the acquisition and modification of the Phase 2 vessel for scientific drilling, as well as subsequent vessel operations and science support activities.  The SIC will also provide shipboard and shore-based technical staffs to support drilling, laboratory and other scientific activity of 25-30 person scientific teams sponsored separately by the IODP members. The United States Science Advisory Committee has undertaken a detailed study of vessel requirements based on science objectives of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Initial Science Plan, and the results of that study are available on the web at (www.joi-odp.org/USSSP/cdc/default.html).  The converted Phase 2 vessel should be consistent with the required drilling platform characteristics identified therein, and have a useful scientific life-span of 10 years or greater.  The major focus of the Phase 2 conversion will be modifications to provide laboratory spaces for geochemical, geological, geophysical and biological analyses of samples and data.  The efficient recovery of complete coring sections is an essential capability.  Habitability and endurance enhancements to comfortably accommodate cruises up to 2 months duration are also key areas of importance.  Funding of the vessel conversion is expected to occur in CY 2005 and 2006, but will depend on future budget appropriations. SPECIFIC ON-BOARD REQUIREMENTS. In addition to acquiring and managing resources necessary for basic ship operations in compliance with recognized safety and classification standards, the SIC will provide on-board scientific services including: (1) procedures and equipment for core/sample handling, including basic description, sampling, storage and shipping; (2) procedures and equipment for evaluation of safety of drilling operations, including hydrocarbon and gas monitoring; (3) laboratory space and equipment for core/sample measurements of paleomagnetics, physical properties, sediment and pore fluid chemistry, paleontology, petrology/hard rock analyses, geochemistry, and microbiology; (4) computer capability for data capture, analysis of data and word processing; (5) supplies and operational support for instrumentation and laboratory operation; (6) facilities and equipment for limited site survey activity to locate/identify drilling sites; (7) facilities/capability for downhole logging activity; (8) special downhole tools for sampling or physical measurements; (9) the maintenance/ replacement of equipment to maintain/upgrade operations to meet evolving scientific requirements during IODP. SPECIFIC SHORE-BASED REQUIREMENTS. The SIC will also be required to provide shore-based science support capabilities that include: (1) facilities for storage and distribution of samples and data; (2) publication of appropriate reports and informational material; (3) required support facilities for seagoing operations; (4) support for legal requirements of operation, including identification of pertinent national and international regulations and acquisition of necessary permits for drilling activities; (5) support for business management and planning, including identification of procedures to develop detailed plans for drilling activities, schedules and shipboard services, and their oversight and supervision, in response to recommendations of an international science planning organization; (6) identification of required engineering and technical development initiatives; (7) assumption of responsibility for certain Ocean Drilling Program equipment and scientific assets including certain shipboard drilling equipment, scientific laboratory equipment, and curation, distribution of ODP cores, samples and data; (8) science outreach and education to communicate IODP activities to the public, and to encourage awareness and interest in the scientific results of the program. SCHEDULE. Phase 1 drilling operations are expected to begin in CY 2004.  Phase 2 ship acquisition and conversion activities are expected to be completed by early CY 2006, with vessel operations and program support activities on a global basis expected to commence shortly thereafter.  Anticipated release date of this solicitation is March 17, 2003.  The NSF anticipates an acquisition strategy with the initial stage resulting in award of the SIC contract and the start of Phase 1 operations, followed by Government participation with the contractor in the Phase 2 vessel selection, conversion planning and shipyard subcontracting process.  A contract performance period of ten years is anticipated.  GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the Contracting Officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. A pre-proposal conference is tentatively scheduled for April 2003 and specific information will be provided in the RFP. The solicitation is being issued in an unrestricted basis and will include an SDB Price Evaluation Adjustment clause and an evaluation factor for SDB participation.

<DESC>On May 29, 2002, an F-16 U.S. Air Force jet fighter crossing the Tohono O?odham Nation airspace had engine trouble and crashed. The impact area was sampled for the presence of jet fuel and heavy metals under project NUEX027102 (Oracle Environmental, 15 Oct 02). One hot spot of JP-8 contamination was identified as well as an ash-laden burn spot contaminated with heavy metals and hydrocarbons. The depth of the JP-8 contamination is between 6 ? 12 inches and the burn spot?s dimensions are approximately 40 feet in length, 15 feet in width and 1 foot in depth. This project involves the cleanup of this contamination. Contaminated soils will be excavated by hand, placed in Supersacks, transported to a staging area and loaded into roll-off containers by helicopter, and then trucked to a landfill for disposal. The bottom of the excavation will be sampled to ensure cleanup goals have been met. Supersacks will be filled with backfill material at the staging area/borrow pit. The backfill bags will be transported to the site via helicopter and spread in the excavation by hand. A final report summarizing field activities and presenting results of the sampling will be written.

Removal of legacy systems and limited site preparation, in accordance with the contractor provided Site Survey Reports, will be accomplished by the customer (e.g., leveling and grading, equipment footings, and trenching for power and control lines, etc). Training for the above systems will be conducted on-site and be administered by the Air Force Security Assistance Training Agency.  The systems described above must be commercial off the shelf items with proven field usage.  Our goals include acquiring proven, highly reliable systems meeting the requirements identified above, and which are easily sustainable systems across the system's life cycles, and achieve earliest reasonable delivery time for all systems identified above.  Your reply should include: product descriptions and substantiate proven field usage and life cycle sustainability; a recommended Work Breakdown Schedule (WBS not to exceed Level 3) for items and services for this effort; pricing data formatted to track to the WBS; an overall Schedule showing key activities such as production, delivery, and installation activities and include time required by the vendor to comply with all export laws and regulations.  All respondents are requested to indicate if they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern or women-owned small business.  Indicate if you are a US or foreign owned company.  In addition, contractors will indicate whether or not their equipments and services are offered through the GSA schedule or any other government-wide agency contract.  All correspondence relating to this matter should be e-mailed, faxed, or mailed to ESC/GAK, Attn: Lano Balulescu, 781-377-9011, fax 781-377-9300, e-mail Lano.Balulescu@hanscom.af.mil, 75 Vandenberg Drive, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-2103.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to award a sole source cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract to SPARTA, Inc. for on-going technical analysis effort in support of Project Hercules Algorithm integration and validation of a layered sensors concept critical to the BMDS radar program under the recently established MDA Sensors Deputate.  SPARTA is currently performing theses services under MDA contract HQ0006-02-C-0004 for MDA/AS Project Hercules algorithm development.  The award will bridge their effort from 31 March 2003 through 31 August 2003. This sole source award is necessary to avoid disruption of significant development and validation in order to begin algorithm integration efforts in FY04, and plan for an initial defensive capability for early FY06. A competitive follow-on procurement for this effort is in process and an RFQ is expected 16 April 2003 with an award no later than 1 August 2003.   
No other known contractor can be acquired in time to support this requirement, and a lapse in service while preparing for a competition could result in an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agency?s requirements. The estimated cost for the validation of the Hercules Algorithm is $500K for the period 31 March 2003 through 31 August 2003.  **See Note 22.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA-209), intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to Rockwell Collins Government Systems (RCGS), 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52498, for a two-year (one base year and one option year) production procurement for the fiscal years (FY) 2004 and 2005 for the AN/ARC-210 family of Electronic Protection (EP) radio equipment requirements for domestic and foreign military sales (FMS).  The FY04 and FY05 procurement requirements include up to approximately 1200 AN/ARC-210 family of EP radios consisting of the RT-1556B, RT-1747D, RT-1824(C), RT-1803, RT-1794(C), RT-1851(C) and FMS variants, inclusive of options and associated equipment; a five (5) year Performance Warranty/ Commercial Repair Depot services; support equipment; engineering technical support; integrated logistics support; spare and repair parts; and associated data.  The RT-1556B configuration functional capabilities include simplex two-way communication of normal and secure voice amplitude modulated (AM) or frequency modulated (FM) signals in the 30.000 MHz to 400 MHz radio frequency (RF) bands.  The RT-1556B also provides the following modes of operation: a dedicated guard receiver which can provide continuous monitoring of the guard frequency in UHF/VHF bands of 243.000 MHz or 121.500 MHz, a receive-only mode of operation in normal and secure voice from 108.000 through 117.9975 MHz (AM), a maritime mode of operation in the 156.000 MHz through 162.025 MHz frequency band, and variable AM and FM electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM) mode(s), these being HAVEQUICK, HAVEQUICK II, and SINCGARS.  The RT-1556B utilizes several types of data buses to convey control and status information among the various WRAs making up the system.  These include the MIL-STD-1553B AVMUX Bus, the Remote Control Data Bus, the Antenna and Filter Data Bus, and the DS-101 Data Loading Bus.  The RT-1556B provides 8.33 kHz channel spacing capability for compatibility with EuroCae (ED-23B), and is software loadable using Advanced Memory Loader Verifier (AMLV).  The RT-1747D has all the modes of operation, features, and performance characteristics of the RT-1556B, plus an added 70 MHz half-duplex converter and the software needed to select half-duplex channels, including SATCOM channels, and operates in the 70 MHz half-duplex mode for UHF beyond line of sight operation.  The RT-1803 has all the modes of operation, features, and performance characteristics of the RT-1556B, except the frequency of the dedicated guard receiver function is 156.8 MHz (maritime guard), and the RT-1803 interoperates on “alpha” maritime channels. The RT-1794(C) has all the modes of operation, features, and performance characteristics of the RT-1556B, plus added capabilities including embedded COMSEC, embedded DAMA for UHF SATCOM, Link 4/4A/11/Aircraft Carrier Landing System (ACLS), MIL-STD-188-220A protocol implementing Variable Message Format, and DS-101 COMSEC keyfill capability.  The RT-1824(C) has all the modes of operation, features, and performance characteristics of the RT-1794(C).  Additionally, the RT-1824(C) provides hardware compatibility for future DAMA A SATCOM interoperability, a plain text data mode, and enhanced VMF message processing.  The RT-1851(C) has all the modes of operation, features, and performance characteristics of the RT-1824(C), and incorporates an embedded FM Immunity filter and upgraded processors, allowing for software upgrades to add VHF Data Link (VDL) modes II and III, CSEL, Saturn, JPALS LAAS, and Bandwidth Efficient Advanced Modulation (BEAM), a waveform compression algorithm providing 80 KBPS in a 25KHZ SatCom channel and 100 KBPS in a 25KHZ LOS channel.  The FY04 and FY05 procurement will be supported by an organizational to commercial depot maintenance strategy.  RCGS is the designer, developer, and sole manufacturer of the AN/ARC-210 Electronic Protection (EP) radio equipment and is the only firm with the necessary knowledge, data, equipment, and experience to perform this effort within the required time frame.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in a negotiated procurement for Consolidated Facilities Management (CFM) services to operate and maintain the Archives I facility at Washington, D.C. (D.C.) and the Archives II facility at College Park, Maryland.  The CFM Contractor must provide all program management, engineering, and services required to operate and maintain both facilities.  The Archives I facility is comprised of the Archives I building at 700 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. in Washington D.C.  The site encompasses an eight-story building, parking area, dry moat, plaza, turf and plant beds, and guardhouse(s) (approximately 1.375 million square feet).  The Archives I building contains approximately 848,635 square feet of occupied area, including offices, records processing offices and storage areas, an exhibition Hall and Gallery, a research complex, media laboratories, an auditorium, conference and training facilities, a fitness center, a snack bar, and a gift shop. The Archives II facility is comprised of the Archives II building (actually composed of ten independent combined buildings numbered 0-9) and site on the northwest corner of the University of Maryland campus at 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland.  The 33 acre site encompasses a seven-story, 1.8 million square foot Archives II building, a cooling tower structure, and guardhouses located at the Adelphi Road entrance and each entrance to the garage. The Archives II building contains approximately 1,374,384 gross square feet of occupiable area, including offices, records processing offices and storage areas; a research complex; extensive conservation and special media laboratories; an auditorium; conference and training facilities; a cafeteria (300 seating capacity); a daycare center; and a physical fitness center; and a four level parking garage with approximately 800 spaces with free parking for employees and the general public.  Parking permits are required and are controlled by Security Contract parking attendants.  These facilities represent a significant investment that must be properly operated and maintained to prevent deterioration of the buildings and the invaluable records stored therein.  For the protection of documents, which are sensitive to chemicals and atmospheric conditions, there are restrictions on the introduction of chemicals, gases, oils, etc.  The buildings contain technology that controls temperature, humidity, and environmental conditions in the records storage (Stack) areas.  The operation of these facilities must be in compliance with strict environmental and atmospheric control standards to minimize potential damage to archival material.  Energy efficiency is an important secondary consideration. The auditoriums, research areas, cafeterias, and other office areas will be open to the public at various times with routine visits by members of Congress, Cabinet level staff, and other dignitaries.  Accordingly, all Contractor personnel must have a security investigation and must abide by strict standards of personal behavior.  Smartness of appearance and cleanliness of the facilities are exceptionally important.  An escort policy for restricted areas is strictly enforced. Normal operating hours are 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM Monday through Friday excluding Federal holidays.  Public access hours for specific locations are as follows:

Archives I & II Research Areas
Monday & Wednesday 8:45AM - 5:00PM Excluding Federal holidays

<DESC>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Planetary Data, Incorporated (PDI) for its proprietary software and communication processor integration for the Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL).  FSL uses the 4-Channel NOAAPort Receiver System, a data ingest system developed and supported by PDI, as its ingest and distribution system for NOAAPort data.  NOAAPort is the operational meteorological data stream disseminated by the NOAA/National Weather Service (NWS).  Data from NOAAPort is used as input to meteorological forecast models that are generated for research purposes and in backup of an operational model run at the NWS/National Center for Environmental Prediction.  NOAAPort data are also used as input to products generated for display on FSL's FX-Net workstations which are used in support of fire weather forecasting by the National Interagency Fire Center and the regional Geographic Area Coordination Centers.  This acquisition would provide for a backup system so that FSL would not be without NOAAPort data in case of a failure of the primary system. The PDI NOAAPort Receiver System includes the following features: built in Local Data Manager (LDM) interface; flexible product filtering including regular expressions of WMO header parts, regular expressions for AFOS PIL parts, and transmission header (type/category/code); flexible filename/LDM data ID creation including WMO header parts, AFOS PIL header parts, transmission header parts, system time, and static strings; built in monitoring software to watch as data comes in; automatic demodulator tuning through M&C port; and Caldera Linux OS.  The software and communication boards will be integrated on a GFE server and must be delivered to the government within 3 weeks of the placement of the purchase order.  Integration of the system into the FSL Central Facility should require, at most, only very minor changes to existing FSL Central Facility coding or procedures.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100,000).  FAR Clauses in full text are at http://www.ARNET.gov/far/ .  This synopsis is issued for information purposes only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or email.  Any source that believes it can supply the required service should respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirement, within 15 days of this notice, to the above address. Information submitted in response to the notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government=s best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Terms and Conditions and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops\#REFERENCE  Hard copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  Anticipated award date will be March 21, 2003.

<DESC>Repair of three, 3-leaf guillotine type doors in building 137, Robins AFB. Each leaf is approximately 7'X55'. Repairs will consist of the replacement of rope sheaves and bearings on the drive shaft, changing the single chain drive to a double chain drive and repairs to the operator and adjustments to the  counter-balancing system. Some of the parts needed to complete the repairs, will have to be locally manufactured. Repairs will also require the replacement of approximately 200' of cable and new weather-stripping on each set of doors. The motorized door operator will need to be repaired; the gearbox and brakes are worn and damaged and will need to be repaired or rebuilt. Other repairs, undetectable now, may be required after work has begun. Overall, the doors need to be repaired into a fully operational condition. Period of performance is estimated at 30-45 days, depending on availability of the hangar bay.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<ARCHDATE>06022003
<CONTACT>Jane Borden, 703-325-1709
<DESC>NA This modification to the Pre-Solicitation Notice previously published is issued to correct the response date.  The U.S. Army Communications Electronics Command (CECOM) Acquisition Center-Washington, on behalf of the Program Manager for Close Combat Systems  and in conjunction with CECOM Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Countermine Division, intends to negotiate a firm fixed price Low Rate Production (LRP) contract with CyTerra Corporation of Orlando, Florida under the auspices of Othe r than full and Open Competition for AN/PSS-14 Mine Detectors (previously known as the Handheld Standoff Mine Detection System (HSTAMIDS)).  The contract will allow for the purchase of up to one hundred and thirty (130) (base and option qtys) AN/PSS-14 uni ts and up to five (5) (base and option qtys) AN/PSS-14 Training Sets within FY 03; and up to seventy (70) (base and option qtys) AN/PSS-14 units and up to five (5) (base and option qtys) AN/PSS-14 Training Sets within FY 04.  In addition, the contract will  allow for two each one year options for contractor logistics and maintenance support for each AN/PSS-14 and AN/PSS-14 Training Set (Sweep Monitoring System (SMS) portion only) purchased (up to 200 and up to10, respectively).  Finally, the contract will in clude a Time and Materials requirement for new equipment training on an as needed basis for FY 04 and FY 05.  The AN/PSS-14 (HSTAMIDS) is a dual-sensor mine detector that provides the Army Combat Engineer units and other users with a much-improved capabili ty to detect low-metallic and metallic mines over the capabilities of the presently fielded AN/PSS-12 Metal Detector. The AN/PSS-14 incorporates Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) coupled with an improved metal detector (MD), an integrated electronics/ algorit hm suite, and enhanced audio alerts.  An AN/PSS-14 Training Set contains one (1) SMS and a Training Target Set.   The SMS is a three-dimensional tracking tool that facilitates and reinforces correct operating techniques during training. The Training Target Set includes 79 special purpose, inert mine-like targets in 8 different configurations. The resultant contract will be firm fixed price.  It has been determined that CyTerra is the 'Only One Responsible Source and no other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements'.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1);  Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  However, all responsible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully provide the required AN/PSS-14 and AN/PSS-14 training s ets shall be considered by the agency.  Responses shall be no longer than ten (10) pages and provided in Microsoft Word compatible format.  Responses shall be submitted via email to jane.borden@cacw.army.mil within 30 calendar days of the date of this noti ce.  The email subject line should include the phrase 'DAAB15-03-R-0018, AN/PSS-14 Response to Presolicitation Notice'.  All requests for further information must be in writing and via email to the above address, telephone requests for additional informati on will not be honored. Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will nor mally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in a negotiated procurement for Consolidated Facilities Management (CFM) services to operate and maintain the Archives I facility at Washington, D.C. (D.C.) and the Archives II facility at College Park, Maryland.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  The CFM Contractor must provide all program management, engineering, and services required to operate and maintain both facilities.  The Archives I facility is comprised of the Archives I building at 700 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. in Washington D.C.  The site encompasses an eight-story building, parking area, dry moat, plaza, turf and plant beds, and guardhouse(s) (approximately 1.375 million square feet).  The Archives I building contains approximately 848,635 square feet of occupied area, including offices, records processing offices and storage areas, an exhibition Hall and Gallery, a research complex, media laboratories, an auditorium, conference and training facilities, a fitness center, a snack bar, and a gift shop. The Archives II facility is comprised of the Archives II building (actually composed of ten independent combined buildings numbered 0-9) and site on the northwest corner of the University of Maryland campus at 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland.  The 33 acre site encompasses a seven-story, 1.8 million square foot Archives II building, a cooling tower structure, and guardhouses located at the Adelphi Road entrance and each entrance to the garage. The Archives II building contains approximately 1,374,384 gross square feet of occupiable area, including offices, records processing offices and storage areas; a research complex; extensive conservation and special media laboratories; an auditorium; conference and training facilities; a cafeteria (300 seating capacity); a daycare center; and a physical fitness center; and a four level parking garage with approximately 800 spaces with free parking for employees and the general public.  Parking permits are required and are controlled by Security Contract parking attendants.  These facilities represent a significant investment that must be properly operated and maintained to prevent deterioration of the buildings and the invaluable records stored therein.  For the protection of documents, which are sensitive to chemicals and atmospheric conditions, there are restrictions on the introduction of chemicals, gases, oils, etc.  The buildings contain technology that controls temperature, humidity, and environmental conditions in the records storage (Stack) areas.  The operation of these facilities must be in compliance with strict environmental and atmospheric control standards to minimize potential damage to archival material.  Energy efficiency is an important secondary consideration. The auditoriums, research areas, cafeterias, and other office areas will be open to the public at various times with routine visits by members of Congress, Cabinet level staff, and other dignitaries.  Accordingly, all Contractor personnel must have a security investigation and must abide by strict standards of personal behavior.  Smartness of appearance and cleanliness of the facilities are exceptionally important.  An escort policy for restricted areas is strictly enforced. Normal operating hours are 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM Monday through Friday excluding Federal holidays.  Public access hours for specific locations are as follows:

Archives I & II Research Areas
Monday & Wednesday 8:45AM - 5:00PM Excluding Federal holidays

<DESC>Amendment with answer to vendor questions has been posted along with an extention to the due date for receipt of proposals.  Proposals are due on March 12, 2003 at 2:00 PM local time.  To download the amendment please go to the following website:  http://www.house.gov/cao-opp/currentsol.htm

The scope of this effort is focused on creating a communications plan to be used for the product launch of the Lawson HCM system.  The plan will establish the communications goals, channels, key messages, and other supporting means for reaching the House's diversified stakeholders.  
It is necessary that the plan identify specific initiatives to support HR PayLinks communications needs, and present an implementation plan with reasonable measures for effectiveness.  Implementation of the communications plan will focus on those activities that have highest potential to produce the desired results.
The plan must be cognizant of the dynamics of organizational change related to such implementations, including points of resistance, and incorporate ideas both from, and for, a broad range of House employees.  The total House population is approximately 10,000.  Many primarily work at the House campus in Washington, DC; however, a number of the House employees are assigned to and work in district offices in the states which their House Member of Congress represents.  
Those with a stake in the success of HR PayLinks range from the Committee on House Administration (CHA), the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), and senior Human Resources (HR) management to those involved in the project development and the actual members of the House workforce.
The plan will establish strategic communications goals and the messages to support them.  The plan will identify various stakeholder audiences and describe the most effective means to reach them.   Specifically, the communications plan shall pinpoint and describe the approach envisioned to most effective reach the end-users, power-users, managers, and other stakeholders - and create an awareness and understanding of the need for change.  It is essential the communication plan stimulates interest among these stakeholders that will lead to their involvement, inspire constructive discussion, and result in their input concerning the project.
CAO accepts that change is hard, and inevitably generates resistance.  Consequently, the HR PayLinks communications plan will be a critical element in the change management process used to create effective change within the House.  The communications plan will be instrumental in setting priorities for handling the information needs of the stakeholder groups and ensuring that House members and staff have a common vision of the change and become a part of the change process.

<CONTACT>Dr. Amy J. Kreoll, AMSTA-AR-WEP, (973) 724-2413
<DESC>Purpose: To identify potential sources for low density polyethylene laminated kraft paper for use in the production of fiber ammunition tubes.  Background: The Army has a need to field water-vapor resistant/ durable fiber ammunition tubes. In the past, this has been achieved through the use of  asphalt coated or asphalt-impregnated kraft papers used in the multi-layer windings of the tubes or through a wax-dipping procedure. Both of these methods present environmental and production problems. Recently, a PolyLam fiber  ammunition tube was developed, which uses low density polyethylene laminated  kraft papers for the construction of the tube. Currently only one source for the paper has been identified. Paper Requirements: The paper must be black in  color through and through (meaning that the kraft paper must be black in color and the polyethylene laminate/impregnation must be either black in color or  clear). The paper/laminated surface shall be resistant  toatches/delamination/gouges. Two paper types are sought. Each of those papers  must meet or exceed the values in the respective table. (Separate file showing  the table is provided on procnet.) The Government will utilize the information  for planning purposes only. All information submitted will be held in a  confidential status. Interested firms should provide a summary of their  capabilities. Any information provided, will be at no cost to the Government. Commercial items are preferred.

<DESC>AETC CONS has submitted this sources sought notice in an effort to recruit either HubZone contractors in the Pensacola area, 8(a) contractors or small businesses that are able to perform the following services: Air Education and Training Command (AETC) needs civilian pilots to fly Air Force T-1A aircraft on Intermediate Navigator training course sorties at Pensacola NAS.

These civilian pilots must be type rated in the Beech 400 jet.  These civilian pilots must either be commercial pilots type rated in the Beech 400 with an instructor pilot rating in the Beech 400, or they must be an Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) rated pilot with a type rating in the Beech 400 jet.

In addition to flying local training sorties for student navigators in the Intermediate Navigator training course, ferry flights of the aircraft must be made for periodic maintenance inspections at Laughlin AFB in Del Rio, Texas.  These periodic maintenance inspections are required after approximately each 200 flying hours on each airframe.

Student loading in the Intermediate Navigator training course at Pensacola NAS can vary from 120 students annually to 360 students annually.  If maximum student loading is experienced, an annual flight load of approximately 6,800 hours for the Intermediate Navigator training course can be expected.

The pilots who fly the Intermediate Navigator training course sorties act as the pilot in command of the sortie.  This entails a preflight briefing, filing of a flight plan, review of aircraft maintenance forms, preflight of the aircraft, use of all Air Force applicable checklists, obtaining a clearance, taxiing the aircraft, flying a prebriefed profile, filling out aircraft maintenance forms after the flight which could include a maintenance personnel debrief, and a crew debriefing.

The contractor should plan on maintaining administrative tracking of all personnel to include tracking of currency of all pilots flying Air Force aircraft.

Supervision of all airborne Air Force T-1A aircraft must also be performed by a rated pilot on the ground.  This ground supervisor aids airborne crews with inflight emergencies.

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought synopsis as part of a market survey for the JSLIST Block 2 Glove (JB2GU). The USMC is seeking product information and/or samples of a glove liner, glove or over-glove shell that can provide  hand protection for US military personnel from chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) contaminants when worn as part of a CBRN ensemble. The JB2GU system will replace the current military NBC protective gloves within the JSLIST and JPACE ensembles. The JB2GU will allow the wearers to perform the full range of missions in CBRN environments worldwide: combat, combat service support, peacekeeping, chemical warfare training, and logistic functions. Products are sought to meet the following 30-day mission (threshold) 45-day (objective) with required protection from the chemical agents for 24 hours from time of contamination.  

The JB2GU optimal solution is for a single glove or glove system to meet all Service requirements.  Any glove system variant must include all layers required for CBRN protection and durability and can include laminates or separate components.  The JB2GU must, however, be compatible with cold weather and other outer gloves that may be worn as supplemental overlayers for special missions/environments.  The JB2GU will be designed to achieve a fully integrated interface with the sleeves of the JSLIST and JPACE CBRN suits and will be compatible with the Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) exchange/dirty doffing and doctrinal decontamination tactics, techniques and procedures used for those ensembles.  

TECHNICAL:  The product shall meet the following performance requirements:  Chemical Protection against HD, GD, GB and VX agents with a 10gm Liquid, 5000ct Vapor, and 5000ct Aerosol challenges; Protection against Alpha/Beta dusty particles; 24 hours protection after exposure to POLs; 24 hours CB protection after 30 days of wear; Decontamination using the Individual Decon Kit to an operationally safe level for 24 hours; Flame Resistance; Compatible with JSLIST and JPACE garment sleeve/gauntlet interface; Provide warfighter with improved dexterity and tactility over current glove; Fit the 5th percentile female and the 99th percentile male; Sizing must be a minimum number in accordance with fit; Reduce sweat retention for the glove when compared to the current glove; Self life of 5 years minimum and 15 years maximum; Weight less than 170 grams; and Color must meet or exceed camouflage, light reflectance, and infrared criteria which apply to the utility uniform or aviation duty uniforms (as applicable).  

Human Factors: Equal to or better than the current military NBC glove – Must have improved comfort, improved tactility and dexterity which allows the wearer to clean, load, and fire individual weapons (to include M16, M249, M60, and M9), to don and doff the clothing and accessories listed in the compatibility requirements below; and to administer atropine injections, chemical detection/decontamination kits.  Objective Requirements – use standard computer keyboards and palm pilot-type computers, conduct flight panel operations in aircraft cockpit, conduct emergency egress procedures, load and unload cargo into an H-52 and C-130, tie a knot on first aid package, operate SINGARS.  

Compatibility: Threshold Requirements – with JSLIST chemical protective ensembles to operate closures; interface fit to wear under the sleeves. Ability to put on and remove the hood, mask, helmet, socks, booties, and boots.  Packaged in unit packaging that can be decontaminated with the use of non-corrosive decontaminates.  Impermeable to any form of Chemical Biological agents, water, and POL products which can maintain a complete seal in storage conditions including extreme cold and heat, and altitude over long periods of time.  The volume of the packaged pair of gloves, or inserts, or shells should be reduced from that of the current butyl rubber gloves and materials both foreign and domestic, for products that are currently able to be produced to meet the requirements described above.  

Each product should be noted as a potential for a glove liner, or a stand-alone glove, or a glove shell for use with aviation glove and cost estimates provided per pair based on large-scale productions.

<SUBJECT>R -- DFAS Vendor Pay Product Line
<DESC>Vendor Pay Product Line Transformation Market Research / Request for Information.  

PURPOSE:

The establishment of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) in January 1991 was an important first step in the continuing process to improve the Department of Defense (DoD) finance and accounting operations.  Prior to DFAS, DoD performed finance and accounting functions at various installations/activities using non-standard systems and procedures.  Over the years DFAS consolidated from 338 offices to 26, reduced manpower by 9,200 positions, reduced systems from 324 to 65, reorganized into business line structure, and received an unqualified audit opinion on its financial statements for fiscal year 2000, 2001, and 2002.
DFAS consists of three major business lines, one being Commercial Pay Services.  The Commercial Pay Services Business Line pays all defense industry partners, ranging from small business vendors to large-scale weapon system contractors.  It is divided into “contract pay” and “vendor pay.”  This notification relates only to the vendor pay portion, known as the Vendor Pay Product Line.  
The Vendor Pay Product Line handles a very large volume of individual payments for day-to-day goods and services, such as supplies, utilities, and transportation support.  However, it also includes payment of other, more complex contractual obligations.  The total payments in FY02 reached nearly $126 billion.

On September 10, 2001, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld announced that the Department of Defense would begin examination and review of the Defense Agencies to determine if functions or processes could be improved.  This announcement led to the development of a DFAS Transformation Strategy.  DFAS is currently developing a Transformation Strategy for the Vendor Pay product line.  
This notification is part of the Transformation Strategy.  It is not a solicitation for services.  This notification is not, in any way, a manifestation of intent to engage in any transformation strategy that will, necessarily, involve the private-sector.  It is only a market survey approach to determine whether the market contains the capability to perform the functions described.  No decision has been made to pursue any kind of private-sector commercial involvement.  This notification is only an attempt to determine whether, at a future date, options that involve commercial involvement can be included in the list of possible transformation strategies that DFAS may consider.  If, for example, at a future date a competitive sourcing were to be studied, information to support that study would be solicited at that time in accordance with the applicable regulatory and statutory requirements.



OVERVIEW OF THE VENDOR PAY FUNCTIONS:

The Vendor Pay function is performed at 22 of the 26 DFAS locations.  

The major areas of the Vendor Pay Product Line include processing supporting contract documents, invoices and receiving reports for both contractual, supporting documentation for miscellaneous non-contractual payments, as well as processing payments for Transportation Pay, Government Charge Card Programs, Non-Temp Storage/Household Goods, and contingency and wartime operations support for the Military Services and Defense Agencies within the Department of Defense.  The Vendor Pay Product Line adheres to current statutory and regulatory requirements including the DoD Financial Management Regulations (DoD FMR) Volume 10 - Contract Pay, Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and the Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), 41 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 101-41 and 102-118, 49 Code of Federal Regulation, 4 Code Federal Regulation, Management Reform Memorandum (MRM) 15 – Reengineering of Defense Transportation Documentation and Financial Processes, and the Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR), Joint Travel Regulation (JTR), and the Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR).  

	
The major functions of Vendor Pay consists of:
1- Document management, to include receipt and control of all Vendor Pay documents, document review and research, preparation of document folders, assembly of completed payment packages for certification, and end-to-end control of documents within Vendor Pay.
2- Customer Service, to include receiving and responding to customer inquiries (internal and external, to include both vendors and the Military Services). 
3-  Verifying the accuracy of all vouchers prior to certification, including supporting documentation.
4- Accounts Payable, to include verification of contracts, invoices and receiving reports, and entry into the applicable entitlement system, using appropriate currency. 
5- Data gathering, analyzing, measuring and reporting performance, cost and workload metrics in accordance with both the DFAS and Commercial Pay Services Balanced Scorecards.
6- Verifying the presence of an applicable obligation against which payments can be made.  
7- Updating and maintaining vendor information.
8- Contract payment file maintenance.
9- Contract reconciliation.
10- Debt management processing, as related to vendor and transportation payments.  
11- Limited classified contract payment processing
12- Transportation Pay (includes disbursing, accounting, pre-pay audits, Power Track, household goods, and claims adjudication).
13- Daily Business Reconciliation.
14- Supporting audit requirements, to include pre- and post-pay audits, both internal and external.
15- Interface with Accounting, to include Disbursing.
16- Interface with Customers/Other Government Agencies.
