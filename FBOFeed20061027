Requests shall include a copy of the relevant index and must be within the allowed time period for adjustment.  Any adjustments authorized as a result of the adjustment request will not be retroactive.  The date the completed request is received by the contracting officer will be the effective date of any changes in price.

The contractor also is required to request downward price adjustments.  All downward adjustments will be retroactive to the authorized adjustment date as specified in this clause.  If downward price adjustments are not requested and this is later revealed through audits or otherwise, the contractor shall reimburse the Government the amount overcharged plus interest.  Interest will be computed at the rate set annually by the Secretary of the Treasury for late contract payments.  Interest will accrue from the date the adjustment should have been made.

In computing any contract price adjustment, the most recently published index as of the date of award will be compared to the most recently published index as of the date of adjustment.  No adjustment shall be made if the referenced change is less than 2%.  Total upward adjustment for the contract period, including any option periods, shall not exceed TEN [10]%, based on the original or option period contract price; downward adjustments are not limited.  Indices are available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 600 E Street N.W., Washington, DC  20212, telephone 202/606-7706.

52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items. (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

1.	Past Performance (3 references that you provided same or similar item(s))
2.	Technical Capabilities
	2{a} Proposed resources available for Technical Assistance
	2{b} Procedures for quality resolutions.
3.	Price

Tradeoff Process:  It may be in the Governments best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technical rated offeror.  This process may include tradeoffs among cost/price and non-cost factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal if the perceived benefits of the highest priced proposal are determined to merit the additional cost.

NOTE:  Past Performance and Technical Capabilities, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.

(b)	A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY EVALUATE PROPOSALS AND AWARD WITH OR WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS.

g. For purposes of FAR 52.203-2, and in accordance with subparagraph (c) thereof, submission of a proposal by the offeror shall be considered certification by the Offeror that the only knowing disclosure by the offeror of its prices to any other offeror will be during the reverse auction.

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) is extending the due date for Pre-Applications under Solicitation Number DE-PS01-06LG00001 from November  6, 2006, to December 31, 2006, to provide interested parties more time to  develop and submit Pre-Applications for loan guarantees to be considered  under this solicitation.  DOE is extending the time period for interested persons to submit  Pre-Applications because of the extensive interest throughout the United  States that has been expressed in the new loan guarantee program and in  this solicitation.  DOE believes the public interest will be served by  affording the numerous parties that have expressed interest in this  program additional time to consider whether and how they wish to  participate in it.  An extension of the deadline also will permit  interested parties, some of whom have requested a deadline extension,  additional time to develop plans and prepare materials for submission to  DOE in response to the solicitation.  Any Project Sponsor that already has filed a Pre-Application with DOE  pursuant to this Solicitation may amend, supplement or revise that  Pre-Application on or before December 31, 2006. This Solicitation Announcement (â€œSolicitationâ€) invites the submission of  Pre-Applications seeking Loan Guarantees (â€œLoan Guaranteesâ€) from the  United States Department of Energy (â€œDOEâ€ or the â€œDepartmentâ€) in support  of debt financing on projects that promote the Presidentâ€™s Advanced Energy  Initiative (â€œAEIâ€) and are eligible to receive loan guarantees under Title  XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16511-16514) (â€œTitle  XVIIâ€) (attached hereto as Appendix A). This solicitation is governed by  the guidelines that are provided herein. Neither a procurement action  (under Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations) nor a financial  assistance award (under 10 CFR Part 600) is contemplated by this  Solicitation. The AEI is designed to reduce our reliance on vulnerable  sources of energy, which will help ensure a growing and prosperous America  in the 21st Century. Please direct all questions or comments to the Loan Guarantee Office at  gprogram@hq.doe.gov This Solicitation for loan guarantees is issued to encourage early  commercial projects in the United States that employ new or significantly  improved technologies and promote the goals of the AEI. By facilitating  the employment of new or significantly improved innovative technologies in  early commercial projects in the United States, we can meet the principal  energy challenges of enhancing energy security, repairing and modernizing  our energy infrastructure, promoting energy conservation, and increasing  our energy supplies in ways that protect and improve the environment.  Successful applicants will not receive any direct funding in the form of a  contract, loan or grant; rather, the Department will provide a guarantee  of payment to 3rd parties financing the proposed project(s).

<RESPDATE>111306
<ARCHDATE>12132006
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with Apex Laboratories Inc., for Development of Biological Indicators (BIs) for Fumigation of Building Materials with Chlorine Dioxide.  The current NAICS code is 541380. Based on the EPA's knowledge of technical support needed for the Statement of Work (SOW), the unique procedures for BI production are specific to each manufacturer and are  proprietary; thus the behavior and reliability of the BI is dependent on the source.  The background behind this EPA requirement is as follows: This requirement will aid in developing and designing improved Biological Indicators (BI's), which not only relate closely to the decontamination of  Bacillus Anthracis contaminated building materials, but can be standardized for use in fumigation studies and future clean-up events.      The purpose of this requirement is to develop BI's that can be standardized and used to indicate the effectiveness of a fumigation cycle for the  decontamination of B. anthracis on porous and non-porous materials.  Through a cooperative Interagency Agreement (IAG) with the U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical and Biological Center (ECBC), the U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC) will be  evaluating the effectiveness of chlorine dioxide and STERIS VHP? technologies to decontaminate building materials contaminated with B. anthracis.  As part of these fumigation studies, BIs produced under this requirement shall be evaluated at ECBC for improved correlation with the decontamination of  building materials contaminated with B. anthracis and the requirements for building decontaminations. Custom BI's shall be prepared and supplied to ECBC for testing.  ECBC will complete fumigation cycles with the custom BI's at one chlorine dioxide concentration, removing five BIs of each type per  three time points per fumigation cycle.  The BIs shall be evaluated for growth by placement in TSB and incubated for up to 7 days.  Additionally, building materials (bare pine wood and painted I-beam steel) contaminated with spores of B. anthracis (NNR1?1) shall be included in each fumigation run.   The CT required for decontamination of the BIs will be compared to the 9000 ppm-hr requirement and the decontamination of the building materials.  After two rounds of modifications the selected BI (by EPA in consultation with ECBC and the contractor) shall then be made in a large enough quantity to  support a D-value study and lab verification testing (300 - 500 BIs).  In order to achieve the required consistency needed for this project, the Government intends to award this order on a sole source basis.          However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting the EPA's requirement may  submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement, based upon responses to this notice,  is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 541380.  Please submit your request in writing to  Scott A. Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov or fax your request to (513) 487-2107.  No telephone requests will be honored.

<DESC>NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (NASA/DFRC) has a requirement to procure one (1) each state-of-the-art, software based, Range Safety mission planning, risk analysis, and risk management systems.  The Joint Advanced Range Safety System (JARSS) program relies on the development of advanced Range Safety algorithms and displays to implement a Range Safety and Mission Planning system for applications relevant to fulfill agency objectives.  The JARSS software tool consists of two (2) main elements, a pre-mission Range Safety risk analysis portion (Mission Planning) and real-time Range Safety risk management portion (Real-Time) that provides safety for the public and safety for high-value equipment and property.  These tools will be used to support several agency and center programs. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, NASA/DFRC intends to procure these services from Infoware Systems, Incorporated (Satellite Beach, Florida).  The procurement of these services from any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  This is a follow-on requirement and compatibility with existing developments is critical and must be maintained.  These services will be procured via a "task order" type arrangement.	The justification of other than full and open competition is based on that Infoware Systems owns the proprietary information of this software being developed for this effort.  Technical data packages, specifications, drawings, or engineering descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been fully developed. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:00PM (PST), 12/12/2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. No oral communications will be accepted in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<CONTACT>Valerie Pickett, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-496-8505, Fax 301-402-0178, Email vp5v@nih.gov
<DESC>Issuing Institute or Center: Office of Research Services/Information Technology Branch (ORS\ITB) 
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as either a solicitation or obligation on the part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), its Institutes or Centers.  The purpose of this RFI is to help the NIH understand the market availability, technical characteristics, and functionality of solutions, tools, or products capable of satisfying the technical, functional, and/or operational characteristics described in this RFI.  NIH will use this market research information in its evaluation of potential technical approaches for administrative workflow management. 

This request for information is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation for quotes or proposals or as an obligation on the part of the government to issue a Request for Quotes or award of a contract.  The government will not pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the government's use of that information. 

NIH welcomes comments from all interested parties on each or all of the questions contained in this RFI.  NIH does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NIH's use of such information.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the NIH's evaluation of the information received.  
Description of Objective:
NIH seeks information on available Business Process Management solutions for an automated web-based application that allows customer entry of Administrative service requests, provides status feedback to users, and gives management the ability to track and balance staff workload.    Due to the sensitive nature of this data, NIH will host any vendor proposed solution.

Description of Environment:
The Administrative Services Branch, Office of Administrative Management, is responsible for providing specific support services related to the direction, coordination, and conduct of administrative management activities and services provided to the Office of Research Services and Office of Research Facilities.  OAM provides assistance in the areas of general administration, workforce planning and development, communications, and space management.  The Administrative Officers (AO) use an automated system to enter, manage, and report requests for administrative services.  

The ASB is looking to replace this current system with an application that provides workflow and Business Process Management functionality. 

The replacement system will be a web-based application that will enable customers to request most AO services from their desktop computers and receive timely status information on their requests.  The new application should make the process for submitting requests as electronic as possible, reducing the number of customer requests received by fax, email, walk-ins, and telephone sources. The system should provide customers with feedback on the status of their requests by email or on demand, route the request to the appropriate AO, and provide a system that is easy to use for both the AO and the customer.  In addition, the application should provide a mechanism for the non-technical system administrator to develop/deploy forms and instructions and define and modify workflows (routings).  AO/ART should also provide robust reporting capabilities such as dynamic ad hoc reporting, graphics, and dash board metrics reporting.

The new system should support the following user roles: the Program Assistant Role (PA), the Administrative Officer Role (AO), the Administrative Officer Management Role (AO Management), the Administrative Officer System Administrator Role (AO System Administrator), the Ethics Coordinator Role, and the Procurement Role.  
1  The PA Role will require the ability to enter requests and receive status updates on those requests.  
2.  The AO Role will need to have the capability to enter, process, and approve requests.
3.  The AO Management Role will need the capability to adjust workloads and review reports.  
4.  The AO System Administrator Role should have the ability to define and modify workflows.  The AO System Administrator Role will also need to be able to develop and deploy forms and instructions.   
5.  The Ethics Coordinator Role should have the ability to approve sponsored and foreign travel requests and view associated status and approval information. 
6.  The Procurement Role will require the ability to obtain statistical information related to request processing such as the number of phone calls, walk-ins, and customer contacts.

Description of Evaluation Criteria:
For the purpose of this RFI, the NIH defines the scope of this technical domain as Business Process Management capabilities required to provide a tailorable web-based application based on defined workflows which will increase productivity and provide a way to authorize, process, and manage administrative requests in an effective and efficient manner in order to meet OAM's mission.  The information gathered through this market research, combined with information gathered through other research and analysis methodologies, will provide the NIH with important decision support information in its evaluation.  NIH will base the selection of its technical standards on the following evaluation criteria:

1.  Availability - Evaluates the availability, failover and performance of the collaboration technology as it relates to server uptime, client uptime and network uptime.
2.  Cost - estimated total cost of ownership (based on market research statistics and independent research opinions).
3.  Existing federal installed base - NIH or other federal government experience with the technology and the use and adoption of the standard or product.
4.  Fit with existing NIH standards, technologies, and systems (for information about existing technologies at NIH, please refer to the NIH Enterprise Architecture website at http//enterprise architecture.nih.gov) - any known interoperability issues a potential standard may have with existing technology standards.
5.  Flexibility - the breadth of the standard?s applicability to multiple NIH stakeholder classes.
6.  Industrial installed base - the use and adoption of the standard throughout industry in general (both commercial and public enterprises).
7.  Maintainability/supportability - the effort and specialized skill sets required to support a technology standard.
8.  Product Life cycle - evaluates the expected time the product will be in use and supported by the vendor and the ability to maintain currency of its functionality and operation.  A longer life cycle is desirable from a training and hardware investment perspectives.
9.  Security - the ability and/or effectiveness and fit of the technology within the NIH security environment.
10.  Strategic value - the breadth of product capabilities in order to leverage an investment.
11.  Vendor viability (vendor viability will be determined by its financial health, position in the market place, external research sources, and any market factors that could compromise the vendor's existence) - the health of the product vendor in terms of its stability, projected longevity, and likelihood it will exist in the future to support the product and later versions of the product.
It is important to reiterate that this RFI is not intended to gather information needed to address each of the decision criteria above.  Received data will be combined with information gathered through other research and analysis methodologies to support NIH's overall evaluation.

Request for Information:

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to notify interested parties of the upcoming AT21 Pre-Solicitation Conference and to provide instructions for requesting subsequent one-on-one industry sessions. The AT21 Pre-Solicitation Conference will be held on Tuesday, 31 Oct 2006 from 1:30 to 5:00 P.M. at the Four Point Sheraton Conference Center, 319 Fountains Parkway, Fairview Heights, Illinois.  The conference is being conducted to provide interested parties the opportunity to improve their understanding of the government's requirements, to identify and resolve concerns regarding the acquisition strategy, to assess the suitability of the proposal instructions and evaluation criteria, including the approach for assessing past performance information, and to address any other industry concerns or questions. 

The following agenda for the AT21 Pre-Solicitation Conference is provided:

1.   Welcome/Introductions
2.   AT21 Program Overview
3.   Solicitation Review
4.   Small Business Goals and Objectives
5.   Requirements Briefing
6.   Question/Answer Session

REGISTRATION FOR THE PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE WILL BEGIN AT 12:30 P.M. ON TUESDAY, OCTOBER 31, 2006.  

USTRANSCOM will host subsequent one-on-one sessions with potential offerors to provide them an opportunity to address any specific areas of concern in regards to the release of the final AT21 solicitation.  The one-on-one sessions will not be a forum to market company specific capabilities or for vendors to obtain information that has not been shared with industry. Sessions will be strictly limited to 30 minutes and will be scheduled on a first-come, first-serve basis.

The one-on-one sessions will be held 01-03 November 2006 at the The MITRE Corporation, Lakepointe Centre Professional Park, 1662 Windham Way, O?Fallon, IL  62269.  To schedule a one-on-one session, please e-mail your company name and point of contact information to Ms. Terri Francoeur at terri.francoeur@ustranscom.mil and Michael Pardue at michael.pardue@ustranscom.mil no later than 25 Oct 2006.  Specific questions can be directed to Ms. Francoeur and Mr. Pardue at 618-256-4300. Due to space limitations, a maximum of ten company (10) representatives will be allowed to participate. Please note that your participation in the one-on-one sessions will be at your company's expense. USTRANSCOM will not provide any reimbursement for costs incurred in travel or other expenses. Further, the government may use any information provided during the one-on-one sessions to complete market research. We highly recommend you not discuss any information you deem as competitive sensitive or proprietary. If you choose to provide written documentation to support your discussion, recommend you identify all sensitive information, such as corporate proprietary information, and state the appropriate restrictions in the evaluation and use of the information provided.  USTRANSCOM appreciates your participation in this acquisition.

The following is a brief synopsis of the AT21 requirement:  

Agile Transportation for the 21st Century will identify and implement business processes and systems that enable USTRANSCOM?s distribution planning, transportation planning, and transportation execution activities in support of the DOD distribution enterprise. This effort will apply best business practices and leverage order management and transportation management technologies; enhance supply chain capabilities resulting in reduced deployment and distribution cycle times, increased customer satisfaction via tailored distribution support, and reduced customer wait time; and, achieve of an environment that provides asset visibility throughout the supply chain and leads to decreased materiel costs.

The effort will focus less on capturing the ?as-is? processes and more on providing a solution ?blueprint? that best meets the program objectives (mission capability and performance), addressing and integrating the myriad of enterprise-wide elements including: organization, culture, personnel competency, business processes, facilities and assets, and enabling information technology. The ultimate solution should define and enable end-to-end integrated processes to achieve transformational impact, rather than applying technology to existing processes for incremental improvement. 

This requirement will be managed in increments as shown below.  Initiation of each increment is not necessarily dependent on the completion of the previous increment.  

Increment	Description
I	Requirements Consolidation and Workflow Management
II	Strategic-Level Optimization and Scheduling
III	Operational-Level Optimization and Scheduling
Post Incr III	Post Increment 3 Support

Specific AT21 requirements will be identified in the Capability Development Document (CDD) and in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) to be included in the upcoming draft solicitation expected to be released the week of October 16, 206.

VI. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.     CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit-Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Openness of Solution and Technology Evaluation-including plans for participation with the evaluation and integration team (see https://extranet.if.afrl.af.mil/programs/CASE/CASE-extra.html for additional information), (3) Related Experience-The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge.   Consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA , and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA.  White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  
      
2.     REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  ARDA and the Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.     AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VIII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission. 

2.     ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:

  Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

AFRL intends to team with one or more U.S. intelligence agencies, and may desire that offerors selected for award would perform in collaboration with those agencies.  Key Performers of prospective awardees whose activities would involve collaboration with the Intelligence Community must hold a current Top Secret Department of Defense (DoD) clearance and be approved for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access.  A sufficient number of non-key performers to enable the effective accomplishment of the proposed research effort must also hold a Top Secret DoD clearance with SCI access, or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access.  In addition, prospective awardees whose activities would be associated with the Intelligence Community must also possess a current DoD Top Secret Facility clearance and an approved SCI Facility (SCIF). Offerors desiring consideration for awards involving collaboration with the Intelligence Community shall identify key personnel and enabling support staff satisfying the above Top Secret DoD clearance and SCI access requirement; shall certify their DoD Top Secret Facility clearance; and, shall detail their organization's approach to maintaining separation of unclassified and classified activities, and controlling need-to-know.

It should be noted that CASE is not intended as a solely classified effort, and that there is a wide range of research that can be done at an unclassified level.  Offerors should make it clear in their white papers and proposals which aspects of their work, if any, will be at the classified level.  While it is possible to execute an entire research program on the unclassified level, having key personnel with Top Secret DoD clearance will enable the program to have greater access to the real needs of analysts, thereby increasing the chances of successful research.

3.     REPORTING: For proposals selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through our web-based reporting system known as JIFFY.     Prior to award the offeror will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement, incorporating all previous modifications, pursuant to FAR 35.016(c). This republishing also includes the following changes: (a) exclude all foreign allied participation at the prime contractor level; (b) remove the reference to questions and answers being posted; and (c) add ombudsman information.  No other changes have been made. 

Technical POC/ Program Manager, Mr. Fred Rahrig, (315) 330-3906, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY, 13441-4505, telephone: (315) 330-3906, email: Fred.Rahrig@rl.af.mil.  Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Lori L. Smith, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-1955, email: Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil.  

The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at the Rome Research Site is seeking firms to conduct applied research and advanced development in Commercial Imagery Archive & Information Dissemination (CIAID).  Research and Development (R&D) efforts shall be directed to provide advancements in the Commercial Imagery (CI) based technology areas to support Air Force and DOD operational missions.  These areas include improved digital geospatial dissemination capabilities, permitting rapid dissemination of large data sets through electronic means; spectral technology, including the integration and fusion of spectral imagery and geospatial data in relationship to intelligence exploitation and support to military operations; and improved speed and accuracy methods for generating and performing digital geographic and geolocation mensuration.  This program will develop, employ and exploit technologies to provide advanced prototype capabilities for potential transitions to operational units.  It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies to provide continued spiral development over the seven year program.  Objective:  The application of CI resources has shown great potential to contribute to the defense information and intelligence mission in the areas of surveillance and reconnaissance, mission planning, target graphics and product generation.  This procurement will assist the government in the establishment of a CIAID R&D Facility, a center of excellence, for technical development of CI technologies, supporting prototype demonstrations of these technologies, and evaluation and selection of transitionable technologies to appropriate organizations and systems.  These organizations and systems are expected to include the 480th Intelligence Wing (480 IW), 36th Intelligence Squadron, Geospatial Product Library Sites, Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS), National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and others as applicable.  Technical Background: The Air Force and other DOD organizations have fostered the use of CI to augment various requirements to support operational missions for the past several years.  For the most part, the results have been widely accepted, and show great potential for providing many new revolutionary information production technologies.  Selected CI related processes have begun to filter into standard production operations, some of which are prototypes.  It is envisioned that this PRDA will provide the means to effectively enact accelerated research, development, test, and evaluation, and ultimately result in more rapid CI technology insertion.  Innovative CIAID Research and Development White Paper Solicitation: AFRL/IFE is soliciting White Papers that provide innovative CIAID research and development.  

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION FOR CIAID WHITE PAPERS. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit an unclassified original plus (3) copies of their White Papers for the CIAID PRDA to AFRL/IFEC, ATTN: Fred Rahrig, Ref. PRDA 03-07-IFKA, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4505 no earlier than thirty (30) days after the publication of this PRDA. White Papers are limited to a total page count of ten (10) pages and shall be double-spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  A softcopy of the white paper in Microsoft Word must also be provided. The White Paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their White Papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  Multiple White Papers may be submitted in different areas of technology.  White Papers will be accepted until 30 Sept 2009.  It is recommended that White Papers be received early in each Fiscal Year, e.g., April, to maximize the possibility of award.  However, White Papers will be accepted at any time, but it is more likely that funding will be available during the early portion of each Fiscal Year.  The purpose of the White Paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this PRDA.  Those White Papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will receive a subsequent award.  White Papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions.  

Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  All responsible firms may submit proposals or White Papers, as appropriate, which shall be considered.  Respondents are asked to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, an e-mail address, and a fax number with their submittal(s) and reference PRDA 03-07-IFKA.  

Awards:  Awards will normally range from 12 to 24 months with dollar amounts typically ranging from $500,000 to $2,000,000 for advanced technology development and integration efforts, per award. Contractor teaming is encouraged.  The total value for all awards under this PRDA is not anticipated to exceed $17,000,000.  AFRL requires innovative, yet demonstrable and usable solutions to meet the needs of this PRDA.  Deliverables will be advanced prototype software applications and integrated system solutions.  Awards of efforts as a result of this PRDA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  

Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished using the following criteria: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to this effort, (3) innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, (4) offerors capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost and fee realism and reasonableness.  In addition, the Government will consider other factors such as, past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity to perform the described effort.  Experience with, and access to, CIAID migration systems will be considered when said migration systems are integral to the proposed work.  Criteria 1 through 4 above will also be used to determine whether White Papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this PRDA and of interest to the Government.  White paper evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other submittals/awards under this PRDA.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  Government Furnished Information/Equipment (GFI/GFE): Required GFI/GFE shall be specified in the white papers for evaluation.  

No minimum facility clearance, safeguarding capability, or personnel clearances are necessary for a CIAID award.  However, these could be required based upon the offeror's proposed role and contribution.  As such, depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require facility clearance and safeguarding capability up to TOP SECRET; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for the appropriate access up to TOP SECRET SI/TK information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  

All foreign allied participate at the prime contractor level is excluded.

Technical POC/ Program Manager, John Vergis, AFRL/IFEA, 525 Brooks Road, Rome  NY 13441-4505, telephone: (315) 330-1771, email: John.Vergis@rl.af.mil.  Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Lori L. Smith, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-1955, email: Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil. 

The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division in collaboration with U.S. Joint Forces Command and Electronic Systems Center are soliciting proposals for innovative approaches in support of the Multi-sensor Aerospace-ground Joint ISR Interoperability Coalition (MAJIIC) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD).  The objective of MAJIIC is to demonstrate network-centric "Post Before Process" ISR capabilities that will enable warfighters and C2ISR systems on IP based operational C2I networks to access and utilize near real time ISR data. ISR data of interest includes mission and sensor data from U.S. Joint Service and Multi-national coalition manned and unmanned air platforms with an initial focus on video, EO, IR, SAR, GMTI, and ELINT sensors. MAJIIC capabilities will be open, scalable, secure, and non-intrusive to current operational ISR architectures; support common and emerging DoD/NATO/Commercial data formats; provide data pedigree and quality tagging; provide a range of data access methods including XML-based Web services and APIs; work in bandwidth challenged environments on DoD operational networks; and provide a flexible architecture that will support both distributed and traditional client-server deployments.  The ultimate goal of MAJIIC is to improve ISR data accessibility and utility in support of time sensitive missions, battlefield situational awareness, decision making, and C2I analysis.

The MAJIIC PRDA will focus on the following technology areas: database optimization techniques; XML-based web services; automated video, imagery and streaming data optimum dissemination techniques; and common geo-registration. In the area of database optimization, technologies are sought to find the optimal techniques in the storage, cataloging, retrieval, and searching of video, EO, IR, SAR, GMTI, and ELINT sensor data, and mission situational awareness information, that will enhance the ability to share data across Service, Joint, and Coalition networks. This will include data parsing, conversion, compression, cataloging, and tagging. In the area of XML web-based services, technologies are sought that will allow for "disadvantaged" users (bandwidth challenged and/or lacking an application that supports raw ISR data formats) to access and display ISR data over the operational network in a legacy and/or commercial formats.  Advanced XML-based web services are also sought to support distributed machine-to-machine interactions, as well as concepts for managing information services across theater networks (e.g., service interface standards, service registries, ontology, access control).  Automated video, imagery, and streaming data dissemination techniques are required to allow for the optimal distribution of real-time and archived video, GMTI, EO, IR, SAR, ELINT, mission, and steaming data across networks that may have limited bandwidth constraints. Common geo-registration is needed to accurately determine target location by reducing detection errors from multiple sensors; MAJIIC is specifically concerned with registering GMTI detections, SAR, ELINT, EO, IR, and video data.  These technologies will be used and validated in military exercises, currently scheduled annually, two (2) per year.  The expectation is that one of these exercises will be in the U.S. and the other exercise will be in the Europe.  Exercise participation will include integration and checkout prior to the exercise, military operator training, technical support during the exercise, performance and discrepancy data collection, and post-exercise analysis.  Additionally, there will be approximately four (4) working group meetings per year, two (2) of which will be in the U.S. and two (2) in Europe, with each meeting lasting approximately one week.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a white paper, not exceeding ten (10) pages, summarizing their proposed approach/solution. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Offerors' white papers may address all or a selected technology area(s) within the scope.  White papers that focus on selected technology areas should include a description of how the concept will integrate with the other technology areas.  The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission. All white papers MUST be submitted to John Vergis via email to John.Vergis@rl.af.mil and reference PRDA-03-16-IFKA.  This PRDA is accepting white papers until 1 Oct 2009, but white papers must be submitted by no later than 10 Oct 03 for consideration of the initial FY 04 award. White papers submitted after this date are less likely to be funded in FY04.  Beyond FY 04, it is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:  FY 05 should be submitted by 1 May 04; FY 06 by 1 May 05; FY 07 by 1 May 06; and, FY 08 by 1 May 07. White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  All responsible organizations may submit a white paper which shall be considered.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. 

Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: (1) Soundness of Approach; (2) Relevance to the Mission; (3) Uniqueness of the Approach, and (4) Cost Realism and Reasonableness. Note: Criteria 1 through 3 are of equal importance and Criteria 1 through 3 are more important than Criteria 4. Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this PRDA.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this PRDA.  

Awards of efforts as a result of this PRDA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions. Individual awards will not normally exceed 48 months with dollar amounts ranging between $200,000 to $800,000 per fiscal year. Total funding for this PRDA is anticipated to be $24.5M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this PRDA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 04 - $1.000M; FY 05 - $5.565M; FY 06 - $6.195M; FY 07 - $6.565M and FY 08 - $5.175.  

Selected offerors may be required to review classified material up to the US SECRET and NATO SECRET level; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to the proposed effort must be cleared for, or eligible for, access to US SECRET and NATO SECRET information. In addition, the offeror must have or have access to a certified and Government-approved facility available to support work under this PRDA.

<DESC>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541618; the activity description is "Other Management Consulting Services"; and the small business size standard is $6.5 million. The Bureau of Reclamation's Pacific Northwest Regional Office (Reclamation) intends to negotiate a sole-source contract for advisory and assistance services with Watershed Resource Solutions (WRS) of Carlton, WA to support and improve the operations of Reclamation's Columbia/Snake Salmon Recovery Office (CSRO) Tributary Habitat Program. Reclamation is one of nine Federal agencies, collectively known as the Federal Caucus, which has natural resource responsibilities under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to coordinate a comprehensive, long-term strategy to restore threatened and endangered salmon and steelhead throughout the Columbia-Snake River Basin of the Pacific Northwest, which includes the Methow River subbasin. Reclamation has determined that (WRS) is the only reasonable source based upon the following criteria: Knowledge of the current state of habitat conditions for ESA endangered and threatened species in the Methow subbasin; experience and past performance in developing options for improvement of fish survival in the Methow subbasin; experience and past performance associated with the habitat improvement efforts in the Methow subbasin; experience and past performance regarding the local social and political issues that affect project initiation under tributary habitat programs in the Methow subbasin; experience and past performance involving multiple Federal, state, tribal, and local agencies for improvement of fish habitat in the Methow subbasin; experience and past performance of successfully interacting with local landowners and other interested parties within the Methow subbasin for improvement of fish habitat; and price. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties that are certain they can meet the requirement must submit in writing an affirmative response and technical capabilities.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  All proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by Reclamation. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by Reclamation not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of Reclamation.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, intends to negotiate and award modifications under its existing indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts with Battelle Memorial Institute, Columbus, OH; the Centre for Applied Microbiology Research, Porton Down, Salisbury, UK; Southern Research Institute, Frederick MD; the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX; SRI International, Menlo Park, CA; University of Chicago at Illinois, Chicago, IL; Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, Albuquerque, NM; and IIT Research Institute, Chicago IL. The contracts? current period of performance will not be affected by these changes.  These contracts were a part of a multiple award made under RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-39 and RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-04-40 for the project titled ?In Vitro and Animal Models for Emerging Diseases and Biodefense.?  The contract numbers are N01-AI-30061, N01-AI-30062, N01-AI-30063, N01-AI-30065, N01-AI-40005, N01-AI-40093, N01-AI-40094, N01-AI-40095, and N01-AI-40096 respectively. The award of these modifications and resulting increase in the contract ceilings will allow the NIAID to utilize more fully the capabilities of these Contractors to meet our needs as outlined in our Biodefense Research Agenda.  These contracts were initiated to bridge the gap between basic research or early target/lead identification and preclinical/advanced product development.  They have become a valuable means of supporting advanced product development and with the creation of Project BioShield, it is likely that NIAID will need more early and advanced product development than originally anticipated.  Therefore, these contracts will be modified to increase the current contract ceilings to a level based on the scientific parts awarded so that additional task orders can be competed and awarded in accordance with FAR Part 16.505 to support this increased demand and allow NIAID to maintain ready and available resources in this area.  The original contracts were awarded using full and open competition procedures. NIAID intends to negotiate and award these modifications under the authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  NIAID wishes to capitalize on the current testing capabilities of these Contractors to accomplish the additional effort anticipated.  This is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties who believe that they are capable of fulfilling this requirement may identify their interest by providing clear and comprehensive information supporting their claim. Please include contact person(s) and phone number(s), and identify the type of business, e.g. educational institution, small business, large for profit, research non-profit, etc. The Government will consider any such information received within 45 days of the publication date of this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within its discretion. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no responses are received within 45 days, the Government shall negotiate and award these modifications to the Contractors listed above. See Government-wide Numbered Note 22. No collect calls will be accepted.

The Government intends to utilize the Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) concept for this procurement.  Under this contract the CMc will function as a collaborative member of the project team and shall be an active participant in pre-construction by providing expertise during the design process (e.g., checking estimates, performing constructability reviews, and design mockups).  The CMc is responsible for all construction, construction supervision, and inspection responsibilities.  The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities which are often performed by both Construction Managers and general contractors.  The CMc must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly development and construction of the proposed project.  The CMC shall be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of architectural, civil, structural, mechanical and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors ; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines.  The CMc shall provide the Government with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, how to achieve the best value in the work being accomplished, schedule control, alternative ideas, problem prevention, and budgeting.  The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, and the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.  Most importantly, the CMc shall have complete responsibility for construction of the facility.  At a pre-determined point in the design phase, likely at about 70%, a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) will be negotiated and construction of the project will begin.  The CMc will be contractually bound to pay for costs that exceed the GMP unless the Government changes the scope.  The estimated construction cost is about $25 - $30 million, to include the CMc?s Preconstruction and Construction Phase Services. This procurement will be negotiated on a best value basis in accordance with FAR 15.101, based primarily on a trade-off between relevancy and quality of present/past performance, and price, with all evaluation factors other than price, when combined, considered significantly more important than price.  The best overall value to the Government includes demonstrating a commitment to construction excellence, providing and maintaining a viable team organization and adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project.   Offerors will be evaluated on relevant corporate experience, past performance on relevant contracts where the offeror acted as prime contractor or CMc, Key Personnel, to include experience and qualification of proposed staff, and price.  The price proposal will include pricing of the CMc?s cost of Pre-construction Services and a total fee for Construction Phase Services, including profit, General Conditions, and other overhead costs.  Interested firms should, as early as possible, but no later than November 13, 2006, indicate interest in this acquisition by letter (no more than 2 typewritten pages), referencing the solicitation number, with a brief summary of experience in relevant contracts (scope and magnitude) where the offeror acted as a prime contractor or CMc, particularly in the construction of BioSafety Level 2, 3, 3Ag laboratories, animal vivariums, necropsies, or similar facilities.  The offeror should describe its performance of the pre-construction and construction phase services provided.  The letter should clearly identify the business size, i.e., large business, small business, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, etc.  Due to the estimated value of this project, the letter must also provide the offerors bonding capacity (single project, aggregate limit, and bonding currently available).  Letters should be sent to the attention of Robert E. Driggers, Contracting Officer, at the contracting office address listed above, preferably as an e-mail attachment, with a copy to Ms. Paulette Webster.  (E-mail addresses are provided below).  More detailed present/past performance information will be required with proposals.  In response to the solicitation, offerors will be required to demonstrate their ability to perform projects of a similar scope and magnitude, perform quality work, complete projects on schedule, and at a reasonable price.  Award of the resulting contract will not necessarily be made to the lowest priced offeror.  It is the intent of the Government to negotiate and award a contract to a well qualified firm with extensive experience in performing projects of similar scope and magnitude.  The Government anticipates significant subcontracting activity under this contract.  The solicitation will be available about late December, 2006, or early January, 2007, with proposals due about mid February, 2007.  The Government intends to use the results of this Sources-Sought Notice to determine acquisition strategy for this procurement, utilizing NAICS Code 236220, Size Standard $31.0M.   If you are interested in this solicitation, please provide the information required above, point of contact, company phone, fax number and e-mail address, to Robert E.

The following information is provided to assist NAVFAC Southeast in conducting a Market Research of Industry to identify potential small business contractors for:
PREPARATION OF ARCHITECTURAL, ARCHEOLOGICAL, AND CULTURAL RESOURCES STUDIES AND DOCUMENTATION OF HISTORICAL PROPERTIES WITHIN THE NAVAL FACILITIES ENGINEERING COMMAND, SOUTHEAST.
Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southeast is seeking U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a), HUBZone Small Business, and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business sources with current relevant qualifications, experience, personnel, and capability to perform the Architect/Engineer (A/E) services required for a firm fixed-price Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for Preparation of Architectural, Archaeological, and Cultural Resources Studies and Documentation of Historical Properties.  The geographical areas to be covered by this contract will encompass the states of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and the north-west section of Florida to include Pensacola, Whiting Field and Panama City.  Also included are the Gulf of Mexico oceanic and riverine waters of all lands identified as the area of responsibility (AOR) of Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southeast.  Currently, there is an existing contract which covers Alabama, Mississippi and the north-west section of Florida including adjacent waters.  These areas will be excluded from this contract until the existing contract expires on 11 August 2007.  The contractor may, on occasion, be tasked to provide the services described herein at Government activities outside the AOR of Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southeast. These actions will be decided on a case-by-case basis approved by the contracting officer. It is anticipated that most work will be in the Southeast AOR.

Required A/E services may be categorized as design or engineering services and will primarily be for preparation of architectural design and drawings in a diversity of architectural styles which conform to the Secretary of the Interior?s Standards for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and Guidelines for Rehabilitation, structural and systems analyses of historic buildings and structures, and documentation thereof.

<SUBJECT>R -- NGA New Campus East (NCE) Move Planning and Execution
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NGA-AC-PI01
<RESPDATE>111006
<ARCHDATE>12152006
<CONTACT>Paula Ireland, Senior Contracting Officer, Phone (703) 805-1477, Fax (703) 805-1548, Email Paula.J.Ireland@nga.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to inform members of industry that NGA is contemplating within the next few months to solicit proposals for move consultation with the option to execute the move to include planning, integration and synchronization services for an enterprise level move into the NGA New Campus East (NCE) to be built at Fort Belvoir, Virginia.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.

The primary objective of this effort is to provide comprehensive consultation services commensurate with planning a phased move of 8500 people to be located in 2.4M GSF starting in March 2010  with minimum disruptions to mission continuity of operations over an 18 month period. 

The NGA is seeking a contractor/contractor team with the proven ability to plan, integrate, organize, synchronize and execute a complex, sustained move of personnel, equipment and materials from six geographically dispersed BRAC locations and several more non-BRAC locations in the Washington D.C. area to a single new NGA campus located at Ft. Belvoir, VA. The move must be planned and executed with a minimum of interruption to the NGA mission and account for the complexities of securing and transporting classified materials. The move must be planned in conjunction with NCE Design and Construction and Information Technology schedules and must be flexible enough to accommodate planned or unforeseen changes in schedule. Specific requirements include:

a.	Provide flexible, tailored NCE phased move planning and consultation services that are based on best industry practices, expertise and technology, manage risk and provide for minimum disruption to NGA business continuity of operations.  

b.	Incorporate NGA personnel, material, risk and systems databases into an industry recognized enterprise move software package sufficient to fully plan and execute the phased move. The package must allow strategic to tactical move modeling and analysis, temporal and spatial occupancy analysis, and total asset tracking and management. 

c.	Utilize best available government furnished databases and information in conjunction with surveys, meetings, and interviews with NGA components and offices and individuals at the BRAC and non-BRAC locations to obtain comprehensive move planning information. 

d.	Provide for the complexities of a classified move.

e.	Ensure NCE Transition move planning is executed in synchronization with both the NCE Integrated Master Schedule and NGA Master Schedule.   

The following requirements are being considered as contract options:

a.	Overall management, integration and execution of the phased move by providing end-to-end packing, moving, storage, staging, re-assembly, and unpacking services for an enterprise-level move. 

b.	Perform an in-depth analysis of risks associated with the phased movement of critical NGA functions, missions, operations, systems and materials with recommendations for a comprehensive strategy to ensure business continuity for the duration of the move.  

Due to the short timeline associated with the NCE schedule, and the classification of geospatial intelligence data sources, systems and methodologies, prospective contractors must presently possess adequate cleared facilities, IAS systems and personnel capable of handling and processing TS//TK//NOFORN data.

To help meet the NCE schedule, NGA is soliciting white papers which provide:

1.	A statement of intent to bid as a prime contractor with supporting rationale on company/team capabilities and experience specified in the requirements and options above.
2.	Ideas for potential performance measurement criteria to minimize schedule and performance risk in implementing the NCE phased move plan and maintaining continuity of operations. 
3.	Lessons learned and best practices with efforts of similar size and scope.

The white paper should be less than ten (10) pages and be submitted to the NGA Point of Contact listed in this notice.  Contractors are advised that response to this notice is not a prerequisite for participation in the NCE acquisition described herein.

<DESC>The Bureau of Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the National Science Foundation, is assessing the market to gain information about the procurement of a audit services.  This notice is not a solicitation, but an inquiry regarding the capabilities of audit services  providers and a request for information from offerors who are willing and capable of providing a presentation regarding audits.  We are seeking information to expand our contractor base and determine type of companies available to fulfill our requirements.



SOURCES SOUGHT
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

BACKGROUND

The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 (P.L. 810 507).  Its goal is to promote and advance scientific progress in the United States.  The agency is responsible for the overall health of science and engineering across all disciplines.  The Foundation is also committed to ensuring an adequate supply of the Nation's scientists, engineers and science educators.  NSF funds research and education in science and engineering by awarding grants and contracts to educational and research institutions in all parts of the United States.  NSF, by law, cannot conduct research or operate research facilities.  Through grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts, NSF enters into relationships with non-Federal organizations to fund research and education initiatives.  

Federal agencies, including NSF, have an independent Office of Inspector General that is authorized by law with recommending policies and practices designed to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness; and conduct audits and investigations to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse.  In support of the NSF mission,?? the NSF-OIG conducts independent and objective audits, investigations, and other reviews by promoting the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness and safeguarding the integrity of NSF programs and operations.  One of the ways that the NSF-OIG provides its support is by ensuring awardee?? compliance with NSF?s and Federal regulations concerning award administration and management.

Each year, the NSF-OIG conducts approximately 25 audits to determine whether awardees are in compliance with the financial and administrative terms and conditions of their award agreement.  These audits include grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements that are funded by NSF and awarded to (1) educational institutions, (2) state, local, and Federally-recognized Indian tribal governments, (3) hospitals, (4) non-profit organizations, and (5) for-profit organizations.  These financial audits include incurred costs, indirect cost rates, pre-award proposals, and other specialty audits, such as reviews of cost sharing and participant support costs.

Approximately 66 percent of the NSF-OIG?s audit work is performed by Contractors and is monitored by NSF-OIG staff.  These audit reports include findings and recommendations, which are monitored for audit resolution by the NSF Cost Analysis and Audit Resolution Branch (CAAR) of the Division of Institution & Award Support (DIAS).  DIAS also monitors the resolution of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133 Audit Reports that were issued by other Contractors on awardees for which NSF is the cognizant agency as well as for awardees whose cognizant agency is not the NSF, but where NSF contributed substantial funds.

SCOPE & METHODOLOGY

The Contractor shall address the following four phases of the audit individually.  The first phase will be to draft a planning document on the survey and internal control fieldwork, the second phase will be to conduct the survey and internal control fieldwork as well as to prepare the survey and internal control assessment report, the third phase will be to conduct substantive audit fieldwork, and the fourth phase will be to prepare the final audit report.  

The financial audit objectives of the audits include determining whether the costs claimed by an awardee are allowable and in conformity with the terms and conditions of the NSF award and Federal requirements.  These financial audits also report on the awardee?s compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and award terms and conditions, and the adequacy of the awardee?s internal control system for effectively accounting for and administering its NSF awards.

Specific objectives of the audit of NSF funds are to:  

Determine whether the Schedule of Award Costs of the awardee presents fairly, in all material respects, the costs claimed on the Federal Cash Transactions Reports (FCTR) in conformity with NSF-OIG?s Financial Audit Guide and the terms and conditions of the NSF award.

Identify matters concerning instances of noncompliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of the award agreement(s) pertaining to NSF awards and weaknesses in the awardee?s internal control over financial reporting that could have a direct and material effect on the Schedule of Award Costs and the awardee?s ability to properly administer, account for, and monitor its NSF awards. 

REQUIREMENTS of AUDIT

The Contractor shall conduct the audit in accordance with the most current version of the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) issued by the Comptroller General of the United States.  (To download a copy of the standards, go to: www.GAO.gov.)  

Government Auditing Standards (GAS) incorporates by reference the field work and the reporting standards issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).    Accordingly, the Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) is part of Government Auditing Standards and must be adhered to where applicable.  Workpapers and audit plans need to make appropriate reference to these standards to provide documentation on their compliance.  

The new audit risk standards are addressed in SAS 104 through 111 and should be incorporated into these audits in order to address assessed risk and the auditor?s response to audit risk and materiality.  The auditor must have a clear understanding of SAS 99 and be able to document and discuss with OIG staff how this standard was met.  Although some of the SAS?s are effective December 15, 2006, we are highly recommending early implementation.

It is important to understand that these audits are not audits of financial statements as they relate to the financial position of an entity nor are they Single Audits under OMB Circular A-133. They are financial audits as they relate to SAS 62 which is incorporated into GAS

In addition to a clear understanding of GAGAS and all the applicable SAS requirements, the Contractor should have a clear understanding of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars applicable to the various organizations being audited.  Additionally, the Contractor should have experience and knowledge on the applicable requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The Contractor should also have experience auditing non-profit organizations.

The Contractor must comply with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) Guidance on GAGAS Requirements for Continuing Professional Education (CPE), which was issued on April 2005.  

The internal control assessments require a complete understanding of The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) framework (see SAS 55 and SAS 112). The internal control assessment requires a COSO based approach to the assessment of awardee?s internal controls.

The Contractor must be an audit firm registered with the State Board of Accountancy.  Additionally, we consider the Partner, Sr. Audit Manager, and the Manager to be key personnel.  Their appropriate resumes are required as part of any proposal submission.  Additionally, as part of the proposal submission, the latest peer review report is required.

The Contractor must have the technical capability to express an audit opinion on the results of audit.  

Our audits are divided into four phases: 

PHASE 1 (Planning)
 
Survey and Internal Control Audit Planning Document:
 
The planning document shall include the Contractor?s planned audit approach including the proposed audit program and sampling methodology for performing the audit survey, gaining an understanding of awardee?s policies and procedures and financial systems for administering its NSF awards, identifying risks in the awardee?s operations for effectively administering its NSF awards, and testing significant internal controls to determine whether those controls are operating effectively to mitigate the identified risk.
 
The Contractor shall provide the proposed planning document to NSF-OIG for review at least one week before the scheduled planning story-conference meeting and the final planning document to NSF-OIG before the start of the on-site survey and internal control assessment site visit.

PHASE 2 (Internal Control)
	
Survey and Internal Control Assessment Report
 
The Survey and Internal Control Assessment Report shall include a summary of the results of the audit survey, assessment of prior audits, including OMB A-133 audit results and their impact, if any, on the scope of the audit, and testing of significant internal controls, including a brief description (i.e., flowcharts, bullets, etc.) of the awardee?s systems for:
 
?	Financial accounting and reporting on NSF award expenditures;
 
?	Accounting and reporting on cost-sharing obligations;

?	Property accountability;
 
?	Sub-recipient monitoring; and
 
?	Ensuring NSF awards are properly administered, accounted for, and monitored in compliance with NSF and Federal requirements.
 
The report shall also include the Contractor's assessment of the risk that the awardee?s systems are not meeting Federal regulations and NSF grant terms and conditions for claiming allowable, reasonable, and allocable costs.  The report shall identify early indications of where there may be instances of noncompliance, weaknesses in internal controls, areas of questioned costs, and non-accomplishment of program award objectives.  
 
The survey and internal control assessment report is not expected to be a comprehensive explanation of each of the areas reviewed, but rather a summary of what was reviewed and assessed and the overall conclusions on the adequacy of the awardee?s financial controls over NSF awards.  The report shall provide a firm justification for continuance or discontinuance of the audit based on the audit results from the survey and internal control assessment.  
 
Should the decision be made to end the audit at the end of the internal controls survey (phase 2), the information obtained by the Contractor as a result of conducting its internal control work at the auditee shall be delineated in the Survey and Internal Control Assessment Report. 
   
Preliminary Notification of Findings (NOFs) form

Based on the results of the survey and internal control assessment, NOFs should be initiated to document the preliminary instances of noncompliance, and weaknesses in internal controls, and potential areas of questioned costs.  At this stage, the NOFs may only identify a potential condition and the associated criteria.  Preliminary NOFs shall be provided to NSF-OIG one week before the survey and internal control assessment story conference meeting.  The findings shall be presented identifying the criteria, condition, cause, and effect.

Substantive testing planning document (if continuance of the audit is warranted)
 
Prior to the survey and internal control assessment story-conference, the Contractor shall also submit to NSF-OIG for review a substantive testing planning document, if a full audit is warranted as a result of the survey and internal control assessment.  At a minimum, this document shall include the proposed audit program including sections on tests of compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and substantive testing procedures to determine whether costs charged to the NSF award(s) by the awardee are allowable, allocable, and reasonable in accordance with applicable Federal cost principles and award terms and conditions.  This substantive testing plan shall consider the results of the survey and internal control assessment.  It shall provide a clear link between the Contractor?s conclusions on the level of risk in the awardee?s financial and compliance systems and the amount and kind of substantive testing work to be performed. 
 
The Contractor shall provide the draft substantive testing planning document to NSF-OIG at least one week before the scheduled survey and internal control assessment story-conference meeting at NSF headquarters and the final substantive testing planning document to NSF-OIG prior to beginning the fieldwork.

OPTIONAL PHASES:

PHASE 3 (Field Work) 

Completed Notifications of Findings

Based on the results of fieldwork in Phases 2 and 3, this document shall detail the final condition, criteria, cause, effect, and recommendations of each finding identified.  Detailed NOFs shall be provided to the NSF-OIG one week before the scheduled fieldwork story conference meeting at NSF headquarters.

<SUBJECT>Intent to modify the existing firm-fixed-price, supply-type contract N00164-06-C-4879.
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, intends to modify the existing firm-fixed-price, supply-type contract N00164-06-C-4879, awarded to NAMMO AS, Raufoss, Norway on 01 Sep 2006 for the production and delivery of up to an additional quantity of 51,840 each MK 285 MOD 0 40mm high velocity ammunition cartridges.  This contract action will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This contract action will procure 51,840 each MK 285 MOD 0 40mm high velocity ammunition cartridges capable of being fired from the 40mm MK 47 MOD 0 Weapon System (specifically the MK47 MOD 0 40mm machine gun).  The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary rights of NAMMO AS and the duplicative costs to the Government to utilize another source to satisfy the Governments requirement.  The point o!  f contact for this action is Mr. John Pfender, telephone 812-854-5198, fax 812-854-5095, e-mail john.pfender@navy.mil (preferred method).  Please reference the above solicitation number when responding to this notice.  Numbered Notes 22 and 26 apply.

<SUBJECT>Modification to Previous Announcement for the Pre-Industry Day Demonstration for Diver Hull Imaging and Navigation System (DHINS)
<DESC>The previous announcement is hereby replaced with the following: All interested contractors are invited to attend a Diver Hull Imaging and Navigation System (DHINS) Program Review for Industry with U.S. Navy Fleet and acquisition personnel.  This system will be used to improve the capabilities of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) divers in conducting Navy Fleet Support Operations.  This event will be held on 28 November 2006 at EDO Corporation, 2800 Shirlington Rd, Suite 1200, Arlington, VA.  Directions to the facility are available upon request; additionally, EDO offices are available by Metro via the Shirlington Gateway shuttle at the Pentagon City Metro stop – if interested in this option, please call 202-207-5825 for schedule.  The objective of this meeting is to provide an opportunity for early industry involvement in the Government's proposed approach for future DHINS procurement.  DHINS will improve the capability of EOD divers to rapidly reconnoiter ship hull and berthing areas, and to investigate and localize unexploded ordnance !  (UXO) objects that impose a threat to Joint and Maritime operations.  Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) may also be planned to incorporate system interoperability with Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs); integration with Expeditionary Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems; and to implement connectivity with a Ship Hull database configured for DHINS applications.  DHINS is anticipated to be composed of a target detection and imaging sensor(s) integrated with a precise navigation sub-system and a voice communication sub-system to enable the accurate detection and mapping of targets that present a potential threat to high value assets.  The system will be used by U.S. Navy EOD divers in performing under hull search and target prosecution missions and will be capable of providing a dive team the ability to search one CVN Carrier class Vessel or two smaller vessels without significant degradation of capabilities when conducting operati!  ons on two separate platforms.  Top-side display and command and contr ol equipment will complete the system configuration.  The system will be designed such that its operation will not inadvertently actuate limpet mines equipped with anti-tampering and/or anti-removal features.  Input received from this DHINS Program Review for Industry will facilitate refinement of a competitive acquisition strategy.  Industry input is desired to allow for an effective acquisition program with well-defined requirements in the future Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Systems Integration Phase.  Attendance at the DHINS Program Review for Industry is not a prerequisite for ultimately submitting any future proposals; however, it will provide a valuable opportunity for questions, answers, and industry input.  Seating is limited.  Request a maximum of two (2) representatives per organization.  Read ahead documentation will be posted for viewing or about 17 November 2006.  Attendees are requested to register for the DHINS Program Review for Industry by providing Co!  mpany/Organization Name, Name(s) of attendees, Company/Organization affiliation, address, telephone number, and e-mail address not later than 22 November 2006.  Registration may be faxed or e-mailed to the Technical Point of Contact (POC) below.  The purpose of this DHINS Program Review for Industry is not to obtain proposals and is solely to offer early industry involvement in a contemplated U.S. Navy procurement.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information obtained during the workshop or for the time and expense of the industry participants involved, nor is the Government obligated to any future acquisition or procurement action.  For questions please contact the Technical POC:  Tim McTrusty, (850) 234-4551, FAX (850) 234-4192, e-mail timothy.j.mctrusty@navy.mil or for contractual issues contact Eddie Rogan at (301) 744-6677, edward.rogan@navy.mil.

Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the NIH's evaluation of the information received.  
Description of Objective:
NIH seeks information on available Business Process Management solutions for an automated web-based application that allows customer entry of Administrative service requests, provides status feedback to users, and gives management the ability to track and balance staff workload.    Due to the sensitive nature of this data, NIH will host any vendor proposed solution.

Description of Environment:
The Administrative Services Branch, Office of Administrative Management, is responsible for providing specific support services related to the direction, coordination, and conduct of administrative management activities and services provided to the Office of Research Services and Office of Research Facilities.  OAM provides assistance in the areas of general administration, workforce planning and development, communications, and space management.  The Administrative Officers (AO) use an automated system to enter, manage, and report requests for administrative services.  

The ASB is looking to replace this current system with an application that provides workflow and Business Process Management functionality. 

The replacement system will be a web-based application that will enable customers to request most AO services from their desktop computers and receive timely status information on their requests.  The new application should make the process for submitting requests as electronic as possible, reducing the number of customer requests received by fax, email, walk-ins, and telephone sources. The system should provide customers with feedback on the status of their requests by email or on demand, route the request to the appropriate AO, and provide a system that is easy to use for both the AO and the customer.  In addition, the application should provide a mechanism for the non-technical system administrator to develop/deploy forms and instructions and define and modify workflows (routings).  AO/ART should also provide robust reporting capabilities such as dynamic ad hoc reporting, graphics, and dash board metrics reporting.

The new system should support the following user roles: the Program Assistant Role (PA), the Administrative Officer Role (AO), the Administrative Officer Management Role (AO Management), the Administrative Officer System Administrator Role (AO System Administrator), the Ethics Coordinator Role, and the Procurement Role.  
1  The PA Role will require the ability to enter requests and receive status updates on those requests.  
2.  The AO Role will need to have the capability to enter, process, and approve requests.
3.  The AO Management Role will need the capability to adjust workloads and review reports.  
4.  The AO System Administrator Role should have the ability to define and modify workflows.  The AO System Administrator Role will also need to be able to develop and deploy forms and instructions.   
5.  The Ethics Coordinator Role should have the ability to approve sponsored and foreign travel requests and view associated status and approval information. 
6.  The Procurement Role will require the ability to obtain statistical information related to request processing such as the number of phone calls, walk-ins, and customer contacts.

Description of Evaluation Criteria:
For the purpose of this RFI, the NIH defines the scope of this technical domain as Business Process Management capabilities required to provide a tailorable web-based application based on defined workflows which will increase productivity and provide a way to authorize, process, and manage administrative requests in an effective and efficient manner in order to meet OAM's mission.  The information gathered through this market research, combined with information gathered through other research and analysis methodologies, will provide the NIH with important decision support information in its evaluation.  NIH will base the selection of its technical standards on the following evaluation criteria:

1.  Availability - Evaluates the availability, failover and performance of the collaboration technology as it relates to server uptime, client uptime and network uptime.
2.  Cost - estimated total cost of ownership (based on market research statistics and independent research opinions).
3.  Existing federal installed base - NIH or other federal government experience with the technology and the use and adoption of the standard or product.
4.  Fit with existing NIH standards, technologies, and systems (for information about existing technologies at NIH, please refer to the NIH Enterprise Architecture website at http//enterprise architecture.nih.gov) - any known interoperability issues a potential standard may have with existing technology standards.
5.  Flexibility - the breadth of the standard?s applicability to multiple NIH stakeholder classes.
6.  Industrial installed base - the use and adoption of the standard throughout industry in general (both commercial and public enterprises).
7.  Maintainability/supportability - the effort and specialized skill sets required to support a technology standard.
8.  Product Life cycle - evaluates the expected time the product will be in use and supported by the vendor and the ability to maintain currency of its functionality and operation.  A longer life cycle is desirable from a training and hardware investment perspectives.
9.  Security - the ability and/or effectiveness and fit of the technology within the NIH security environment.
10.  Strategic value - the breadth of product capabilities in order to leverage an investment.
11.  Vendor viability (vendor viability will be determined by its financial health, position in the market place, external research sources, and any market factors that could compromise the vendor's existence) - the health of the product vendor in terms of its stability, projected longevity, and likelihood it will exist in the future to support the product and later versions of the product.
It is important to reiterate that this RFI is not intended to gather information needed to address each of the decision criteria above.  Received data will be combined with information gathered through other research and analysis methodologies to support NIH's overall evaluation.

3.  SUPERVISION
The Senior Management/Program Advisor will receive general guidance from the INL Deputy Executive Director and from the office principal to whom assigned.  As a recognized authority in management and INL program issues, the incumbent will receive administrative, management and program policy direction concerning overall program priorities and objectives, after which he/she independently negotiates the scope and objectives of each tasking with little input or review by his/her supervisor.  The incumbent typically exercises discretion and judgment in determining whether to broaden or narrow the scope of the assigned programs, projects or studies.  Completed work is reviewed for potential influence on broad INL policy and goals, fulfillment of objectives, and contributions to advancement of best practices, and is normally accepted without significant changes.

The incumbent of this position does not have supervisory responsibilities.  However, when tasked with substituting for senior staff in INL or at an overseas NAS on a temporary basis, the incumbent may supervise non-direct hire staff and provide leadership and direction to other local hire personnel in the organization.
5.  GUIDELINES
Guidelines include basic legislation, including Chapter 8 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  Other laws, including other authorities under the FAA, several Narcotics Control Acts, the Narcotics Control Trade Act, the Arms Export Control Act, provisions of DOD authorization acts, provisions of the annual Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Program Appropriations Act, other supplemental appropriation laws, and the State Department Basic Authorities Act, also contain provisions relevant to the programs for which INL has responsibility.  In addition, broad agency policy statements for the program may include reference to pertinent legislative history.
The INL Financial Management Handbook, INL Program and Policy Guide and INL Procurement Policies and Procedures provide supplementary guidance to the Foreign Affairs Manuals for Personnel Management (3 FAM), Financial Management (4 FAM), General Services(6 FAM), and Logistics Management(14 FAM) and associated Foreign Affairs Handbooks, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Department of State Acquisition Regulation (DOSAR).
The Senior Management/Program Advisor must exercise substantial judgment based on an in-depth knowledge of applicable guidelines and regulations to interpret and adapt existing precedents, in developing new or improved approaches, and in analyzing controversial and/or nationally important subjects to persons with conflicting views.  The incumbent is recognized as an expert in the development and/or interpretation of guidance on a full range of management issues.
6.  COMPLEXITY
The work involves planning, organizing, and completing projects and managing day-to-day programs.  Because of the complexity, high visibility, and/or political sensitivity related to many issues with which the Bureau is involved, the incumbent may encounter difficulty in identifying the exact nature of the relevant issues or problems and in planning, organizing, and determining the scope and depth of tasks, studies and/or audits to be undertaken.  The incumbent may also encounter difficulty in separating the substantive nature of programs or issues into their components and determining the best course of action and/or discerning the intent of legislation, policy statements, or bilateral agreements and determining how to best translate the intent into program actions.  The work may require the incumbent to establish new concepts, theories, or programs and considerable effort to resolve previously unyielding problems.
7.  SCOPE AND EFFECTIVENESS
The Senior Management/Program Advisor performs a broad range of tasks related to a complex foreign assistance program that spans a full range of counternarcotics, anticrime, criminal justice and civilian police programs throughout the world.  INL programs have a significant impact on the domestic and overseas operations of the Department, as well as on other USG agencies and international organizations.  The incumbent may be required to travel to and work in hazardous duties areas such as Afghanistan and Colombia.
8.  PERSONAL CONTACTS
The incumbent works closely with the senior INL management team, as well as with personnel in other bureaus of the Department of State, other USG agencies and overseas posts.
 9.  PURPOSE OF CONTACTS
The Senior Management/Program Advisor may represent INL/RM, and occasionally INL, in high-level meetings in the Department, at overseas posts, and with other agencies, on a full range of issues relating to international narcotics and crime control programs and management issues.  The purpose of these meetings may be to justify, defend, negotiate, or settle matters involving significant or controversial issues, often in situations where the people involved have diverse viewpoints, goals, or objectives requiring the incumbent to achieve a common understanding of the problem and a satisfactory solution by convincing them, arriving at a compromise, or developing suitable alternatives.
10.  RELATIONSHIPS
The incumbent reports directly to the Deputy Executive Director who is the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).  In no instance will the COR be authorized to alter or modify the specifications or the contract terms or the conditions or waive the Government?s requirement, price, delivery, or other terms and conditions.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS, JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION Pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subparts 
6.302-1(a)1 and 6.302-1(a)(2) and the Bureau of Prisons Acquisition Policy Subpart 6.304(b), the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has determined the use of other than full and open competitive procedures is justified for this procurement action.  The following is supporting documentation in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.303-2 (Content).1.	Contracting Agency - United 
States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Central Office, Administration Division, Acquisitions Branch, National Acquisitions Section.  Requiring Office: Information, Policy and Public Affairs Division, Office of Information Systems 2.  Description of Action - The Federal Bureau of Prisons, Office of Information Systems has a requirement for software maintenance services for Tetragon Limited Liability Company (LLC) Intercomm Teleprocessing Monitor software.  The Intercomm software directs and controls all transactions and terminal access to the BOP SENTRY system. 3.  Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the   Agency?s Needs - Inclusive of the Estimate Value - The BOP requires software maintenance services for the Intercomm Teleprocessing Monitor.  The software maintenance services includes:
a.  All new software releases; b.  System updates; c.  Program temporary fixes (PTF?s);
d.  Documenting updates related to Intercomm products; and e.  Toll-free hot-line support, twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week for system software assistance.
The estimated value of the software maintenance is $104,000.00.
4. Statutory Authority Substantiating this Action - FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements - (1) Citations: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). 5.  	Reason for Authority Cited - The BOP requires maintenance and support for the 
Intercom Teleprocessing Monitoring which controls the functions and abilities of the SENTRY system.  Intercomm is a mainframe telecommunications transaction processing system, which directs and controls all transactions and terminal access to the BOP SENTRY system.  The SENTRY system is an ongoing, steady-state, legacy system with development and enhancements done by BOP staff.  SENTRY fully supports the BOP?s business operations, which include inmate population monitoring, sentence monitoring, designations, central inmate monitoring, administrative remedy system, inmate discipline, and financial responsibility.  Without the maintenance of the Intercomm Teleprocessing Monitor, online access to the SENTRY database will cease to exist.  The agency?s need for the services listed above can only be provided by one source.  Tetragon owns the proprietary rights to this software.  The services required are not available from an other source. 6. Efforts to Obtain Competition - A pre-solicitation notice will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities website www.fedbizopps.gov which will offer notice of the BOP?s intent to award a contract on a sole source basis to Tetragon LLC and requested quotations from interested parties.  7. Contracting Officer?s Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination-A review of Tetragon LLC?s proposed price was completed by the contracting officer.  Based on the submittal from Tetragon and additional market research, it was determined that the quote was based on established market pricing and is acceptable to the Government.  In addition, historical data supports the fact that software maintenance fees are generally 15 percent - 25 percent of the current manufacturer?s suggested retail price of the software.  In this instance, software and maintenance support are in direct comparison to the percentage.  The prices offered by Tetragon Corporation are considered fair and reasonable based on market research, historical data, and previously paid prices. 8. Market Survey - A pre-solicitation notice will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities website www.fedbizopps.gov which will offer notice of the BOP?s intent to award a contract on a sole source basis to Tetragon LLC and requested quotations from interested parties.  
9. Other Factors - The maintenance services and support is required to maintain the Intercomm Teleprocessing Monitor which incorporates the SENTRY system.  Lack of maintenance for this system would be detrimental to the BOP, as the SENTRY system controls and directs the many phases of transactions and interactions within the BOP concerning inmates. 10.  List of Sources - Tetragon Corporation - Tetragon owns the proprietary rights to the Intercomm Teleprocessing Monitor software. 11.  Action to be Taken to Promote Future Competition - Not Applicable
12. Technical Certification - I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in this Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, Andrew Ellis, Chief Network Management, Information, Policy & Public Affairs Division. 13.  Contracting Officer?s Certification - I hereby certify this request for Justification and Approval of Other Than Full and Open Competition is made in good faith, the supporting data and information are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, and I would not be making this request if it were feasible to fully compete this requirement.  I further certify that this request is not the result of lack of advance planning or a desire to expend funds while those funds are still available. P. A. Donahue-Ormandy, Contract Specialist; National Acquisitions Section. Concurrence: Jan R. Johns, Chief, National Acquisitions Section; Paul R. Courtney,  Branch Chief Acquisitions Branch; 14.  Approval: Darlene Ely, Procurement Executive.

<DESC><p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) seeks to procure Uninterruptible Power Supply units (Part Number SYA8K16P), UPS accessories, and start-up services for APC manufactured devices. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.
