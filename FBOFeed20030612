<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to issue a competitive Request For Proposal (RFP) for Increasing Belt Use Among Children Ages 8-15.  NHTSA collects observation data on restraint use in motor vehicles through its National Occupant Protection Use Survey (NOPUS).  NOPUS results since 1998 have shown the restraint usage rate by both infants (under age 1) and toddlers (ages 1-4) to exceed 90 percent.  However, restraint usage for older children is significantly lower.  Recorded restraint usage by children ages 8-15 was 82 percent according to the 2002 NOPUS.  And that figure only referred to the front seat.  Usage is typically lower among passengers in the back seat.  The objectives of this procurement are to determine the nature and causes of the occupant protection problem among children ages 8 through 15, and recommend strategic approaches for increasing seat belt use among that age group based on collected information.  This procurement is set-aside for 8(a) small disadvantaged business participation only.  It is intended that a fixed fee type contract will be awarded for this effort.  The anticipated period of performance for this effort is twenty-two (22) months.  The NAICS Code is 541990 for this procurement.  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a Worldwide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the FedBizOpps page is www.fedbizopps.gov or www.eps.gov.  It is the Offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Requests for paper copies of RFP will not be accepted.  The anticipated date for the release of the RFP is on or before June 25, 2003.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida (NSWCDDCSS), intends to award a sole-source cost plus fixed fee contract to Advanced Acoustic Concepts, Inc. of Hauppauge, NY. for development of an Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) contact recognition training system using the same technology developed for the SNIUTT project. The desired capabilities (primary knowledge, advanced skills, and recurring refresher training) of a contact recognition training system are: §	Use actual sonar (volume, forward looking, side scan)/EOID tapes and high fidelity dynamic simulation/stimulation of sonar/EOID data and underwater environment to train operators on accurate recognition of mine-like, non mine-like, mines and non-mine contacts. §	Use actual sonar (volume, forward looking, side scan)/ EOID tapes and high fidelity dynamic simulati on/stimulation of sonar/EOID data and underwater environment to train operators on differentiation between types of mine-like contacts and types of mines. §	Embed the training into the mine hunting sonar operating equipment and post mission analysis stations to properly train mine warfare acoustic/EOID operators/analysts. §	Provide training to sonar/EOID operators and analysts through distributed learning technologies. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. This effort builds directly on technologies, algorithms, and software developed by AAC in developing highly sophisticated embedded anti-submarine warfare sonar training systems under the Surface Navy Integrated Undersea Tactical Technology (SNIUTT) project. AAC was the originator of and developed the initial concept of SNIUTT. In the initial phase of the project AAC devel oped the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 Surface Undersea Warfare Combat System On Board Trainer, and the Aircraft Carrier Tactical Support Center analysis and tactical trainer. These trainers are used to provide realistic operator training as well as test complex system team trainers. Funding for this project was a Congressional add for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 Appropriations Act and the language in the legislation specifically designates the funding for the SNIUTT project. As the originator of the SNIUTT concept and the developer of the initial trainers under the project, AAC is the only source with the prerequisite experience, knowledge, and expertise required to successfully perform this requirement.

<DESC>The Naval air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA is soliciting Proposals to procure, on an other than full and open competition basis, a quantity of one (1) Nanotech 350UPL Diamond Turning Machine System with a 3 axis (X, Z, C) diamond turning machine, integrated Delta Tau CNC controller with NT Windows environment, and temperature stability system under a fixed price contract.  Options if awarded, to be exercised at contract award include work and tool holding fixtures, cutting coolant system, error compensation and surface profilometer system.  The contract will be issued to Moore Nanotechnology Systems, LLC, Keene, NH. This system will be used in a research and development environment to expand the state of the art in diamond turning and ultra-precision grinding technology, therefore, it must be of the highest attainable performance.  Primary uses of this system will be to conduct process research in diamond turning and ultra-precision grinding, and to produce developmental optical components using these techniques.  These optical components will be used in research and prototype visible and infrared systems such as tactical optical aids, range surveillance equipment, and weapons such as guided missiles.  Optical surfaces to be produced by this system include toroidal sections, aspheric surfaces, sinusoidal surfaces, diffractive surfaces, and micro-feature surfaces.  Characteristics critical to above listed applications are a “poured” or cast synthetic granite machine base, and a high performance Precision Instruments Inc. work spindle “C” axis. Critical functions of the pour granite base are form complexity for dynamic performance and built in protection of delicate feedback scales from flood coolant; encoder shielding through “molded in” coolant channels, splash shields and raised encoder bays to prevent contamination by coolant and cutting chips; optimized center of gravity location for improved dynamic stability of the machine; and internal vibration damping with molded vibration isolation mounts points to improve dynamic stability.  Must be ready for operations requiring flood cooling.  Precision Instruments Inc. air-bearing work spindle with integrated 5000 line encoder as the high performance “C” axis, with final resolution of 0.063 arc seconds at speeds up to 2000 RPM, provides angular position feedback necessary for the production of high quality complex optical surfaces, is temperature controlled throughout the motor and bearings to eliminate thermal growth of the spindle and improve accuracy of system, with groove compensated bearings for improved dynamic response. Industry standard Delta Tau motion controller hardware and software with Windows interface for compatibility with auxiliary applications such as Lab View and Mathlab.  Installation and training at Naval Warfare Center Weapons Division China Lake will be required.
Award is anticipated in September 2003 and delivery of the system will be due 90 days after contract award. The Request for Proposal will be issued on or about 27 Jun 2003 and will be available through the Contract Competency homepage Website at: https//contracts.nawcwd.navy.mil/rfp-nawc.htm. Responses to this intent to solicit, other than from the source listed, will be required to submit information in writing to verify their prior experience in manufacturing Ultra-Precision Diamond Turning Machine System with a 3 axis (X, Z, C) diamond turning machine, integrated CNC controller, industry standard software, and temperature stability system that meets the characteristics referenced within. The Government anticipates a 30-day response time for receipt of proposals.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>Due Date Extenstion and Change in Point of Contact - Request For Information (RFI) on Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) Rugged E-Tool Storage and Charging Case The Technical Data Division (TDD) of the Materiel Systems Group's (MSG) Business Information Systems Program Office (SPO) at Wright-Patterson AFB OH is requesting information, as part of a market research effort, on a Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) rugged storage and charging case.  The case must provide space to transport and store a minimum of 12 E-Tool hardware devices (laptops, slate, handhelds, etc, all ruggedized to Mil Spec 810F). This case must contain an auto sensing, Department of Defense (DoD) compatible, worldwide capable, COTS power supply/power distribution center capable of providing fused facility power to each E-Tool’s AC/DC Converter, an internal hub, a possible rack mounted server, 6 battery chargers, and any cooling system, if required.  The case must provide a cooling system sufficient to allow simultaneous operation and battery charging for all of the hardware devices while fully closed.  The case must have recessed plugs to facilitate one external power and one external LAN connection.   The case must provide space to house the E-tool devices and their AC/DC converters.   All internal wiring should be Cat 5 and properly routed to prevent chaffing.  All devices must be sufficiently anchored and protected for transportation and storage.  Further, this capability must be configured for placement on standard 463L pallets, be rugged enough to meet aircraft transport restrictions (“g” loading, PSI and dimensions) and be environmentally resistant (i.e., rain, sand, etc).  The United States Air Force (USAF) anticipates stacking these cases two high.  The total weight of the case should be kept to a minimum to facilitate stacking and ease of use.  The case should have universal slots, shelves or drawers for the hardware devices as well as an accessory drawer for parts/cable storage and a drawer for charging extra batteries.  Additionally the case should have space to house a small rack mounted server.  The case would ideally allow for some future expansion. Questions concerning this matter should be sent electronically to the Contracting Officer Timothy Hannah, Timothy.Hannah@wpafb.af.mil. Responses are due no later than 3:00 PM EDT, Monday, 23 June 2003 and shall be sent electronically to the Contracting Officer Timothy Hannah, Timothy.Hannah@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>The Federal Government is seeking interested parties to potentially supply renewable energy/REC in North Carolina behind the Duke Energy Service Territory, with the possibility of other locations as well.  Requirements are estimated at approximately 30 million kWh.  We are seeking Green-e certified (or the equivalent) REC, or renewable energy located close to North Carolina, but not necessarily within the state.  Interested parties should submit all of the following information:  (1) the amount of renewable energy/REC available, that will not be under contract elsewhere; (2) location of source facility; (3) the type of renewable energy/REC provided.  (If the energy provided is biomass, please provide as much information as possible about its source.  In keeping with the Federal Government definition of renewable energy, as outlined in Executive Order 13123, no hydro power of any size can be considered at this time); (4) the date the source facility started production; (5) and nonbinding prices of the renewable energy/REC.  Any pricing submitted under this RFI will be kept on a need to know basis.  Since DESC is not the intended end use customer, certain data received will need to be shared outside this organization.  If you provide pricing, do you have ranges/tiers that are applicable based on volume purchased or length of contract?  In the event your facility is under construction when will it be completed?

In addition, interested parties must indicate if Green-e certification is used, and if not, what alternative is being proposed for product substantiation.

This RFI is for market survey purposes only and does not/will not obligate the U.S. Government nor the respondent to any contractual relationship.  Interested parties are encouraged to submit one or more concept proposals that address each of the foregoing areas.  We look forward to receiving your responses and welcome your feedback.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ON THE ACQUISITON STRATEGY FOR A LARGE ORSC OXYGEN/KEROSENE ROCKET ENGINE General Information Reference Number: RFI2003-PS53-01 Response Date: July 11, 2003 Contracting Office Address NASA/George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), Procurement Office/PS50, Bldg. 4203, Marshall Space Flight Center, AL   35812 (see POCs listed on last page) PURSUANT TO FAR 52.215-3 ENTITLED REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, NASA DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS SYNOPSIS. THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES AND TO ALLOW INDUSTRY THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE INPUTS AND PROVIDE INFORMATION FOR USE IN THE OVERALL DEVELOPMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND ACQUISITION STRATEGY, AS WELL AS PROMOTE COMPETITION AND SUBCONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES. Description Interested parties who intend to respond to this RFI are requested to notify PS50 via email within five business days of posting this notice on NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS).  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the NAIS for information concerning the release of future solicitations.  THE RFI RESPONSE MUST BE SUBMITTED NO LATER THAN JULY 11, 2003.  In addition, a LETTER OF INTENT TO PROPOSE from interested parties is requested to be submitted no later than July 11, 2003. Purpose NASA/MSFC is seeking ideas, acquisition strategies, and information from potential offerors on the development approach for a large, one-million pound thrust-class, oxidizer–rich staged combustion (ORSC) oxygen/kerosene (LOX/Kerosene) booster rocket engine for a two-stage-to-orbit Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV).	This RFI addresses all the steps in the rocket engine development process but focuses on maturing the design, building, testing, and demonstration of an ORSC LOX/Kerosene prototype risk reduction rocket engine to advance the technology to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6.  Attachment #2 describes the NASA TRL for this RFI. Background The NASA Next Generation Launch Technology (NGLT) program plans to issue a Request For Proposal (RFP) this year to mature, build, test, and demonstrate an ORSC LOX/Kerosene prototype risk reduction rocket engine to TRL 6 that can support the design of a human-rated ORSC RLV flight engine. Development of this prototype engine will flow into the overall NGLT program goals to achieve a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) maturity level on the human-rated flight engine in time to support a Full-Scale Development (FSD) decision in FY2009.   Various rocket engine power cycles and propellants were investigated under Space Launch Initiative’s (SLI) 2nd Generation Reusable Launch Vehicle program.  Technologies examined were Fuel-Rich Staged Combustion, Oxidizer–Rich Staged Combustion, Expander Cycle and others.  Propellants such as oxygen, hydrogen, kerosene, hydrogen peroxide, hydrocarbons, and others were investigated.  The goal was to mature engine propulsion systems and technologies to a higher TRL. In September 2002, the decision was made to emphasize the higher thrust-class LOX/Kerosene ORSC engine.  The LOX/Kerosene ORSC rocket engine propulsion system represented the best case for achieving the combined goals of performance, operability, and versatility to both NASA and the U.S. Air Force.  To meet quick turnaround, operability, availability, and cost requirements the LOX/Kerosene ORSC rocket engine propulsion system must seamlessly combine Supportability, Operability, Reliability and Maintainability (SORM) and Integrated Engine Health Management (IEHM). The Level 1 and Level 2 prototype engine propulsion systems requirements will be documented, in the soon-to-be-baselined, NGLT Program Requirements Document (PRD) (See Attachment #1).  The DRAFT requirements for the prototype LOX/Kerosene ORSC rocket engine propulsion system are shown in the current DRAFT NGLT Program PRD.  The proposed prototype risk reduction LOX/Kerosene ORSC rocket engine propulsion system must be traceable to the DRAFT NGLT Program PRD requirements. Request For Information (RFI) This RFI requests that interested parties provide an assessment of: 1.     Anticipated top level work breakdown structure 2.	  Government Requirements (Attachment #1) 3.	Risks (programmatic and technical) 4.	Overall design maturity and TRL  (components and engine system) 5.	    Test Facility and Vehicle Interfaces 6. Performance Metrics and Recommended Incentive Structure 7.      Test Planning and Facilities Utilization (to include Government Furnished Property (GFP) /Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and Test Sites) 8.       Schedules, Milestones and anticipated durations to accomplish these development goals. The RFI response must be submitted no later than July 11, 2003 in order for the Government to utilize in the anticipated RFP development. A LETTER OF INTENT TO PROPOSE to the RFP from interested parties is to be submitted no later than July 11, 2003. Future Procurement Actions The RFI seeks information on the ORSC engine development process.  The anticipated near-term RFP procurement action is to build a full-scale risk reduction prototype engine, conduct tests and demonstrations to achieve TRL 6. Anticipated RFP Requirements NASA/MSFC intends to release a draft RFP for the prototype rocket engine during the fall of 2003.  Attachment #3 is a summary of the near term acquisition milestones for this RFI/RFP. The government anticipates significant subcontracting opportunities for small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, historically under-utilized business zone small businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses for this requirement. The Government anticipates awarding a Cost-Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) and Cost-Plus Award Fee (CPAF) hybrid contract from the anticipated Prototype Engine RFP.  The specific distribution of the fee pools will be subject to negotiation at the appropriate time. Rocket engine or rocket engine component testing can be proposed at contractor owned and/or Government test facilities.  In either case, any solicitation will require evidence of coordination of these test facilities through the Rocket Propulsion Test Management Board (RPTMB) at NASA’s Stennis Space Center.  It is incumbent upon interested parties to ultimately receive concurrence from the RPTMB on all proposed propulsion testing activities prior to submitting a response to the RFP.  As a minimum, evidence should include confirmation of facility availability, cost for use of facility, cost of any modifications to support testing, and the schedule for testing.  The RPTMB website can be accessed at https://rockettest.ssc.nasa.gov. RPTMB Point of Contact (only) Name: Kevin Power Title: Propulsion Test Integration Office & RPTMB Point of Contact Phone: 228-688-1490 FAX: 228-688-7286 e-mail: Kevin.P.Power@nasa.gov A follow-on future procurement action may initiate the design of the human-rated flight engine, sometime during prototype testing, and proceed with design to a PDR maturity level to support the FSD decision date.  A subsequent future procurement action would initiate FSD of the human-rated flight engine, including completion of detailed design, fabrication, and test of development engines and engine certification to support a first flight. The issues delineated in the forgoing are not intended to be exhaustive.  Respondents are encouraged to provide any additional comments that will help develop the best NGLT program acquisition strategy.  Any information obtained as a result of this RFI is intended for use by the government as a basis for planning.  Providing data or information that is proprietary, limited, or restricted for use by the government may be of limited value and as such restricted/limited data and information is not desirable.  Any such restricted data must be clearly, individually and specifically marked. The government plans to use the information received from the RFI to assist in preparing the draft RFP and planning the overall NGLT engine acquisition strategy.  After contract award from the RFP process, MSFC NGLT ORSC support contractors may be used as summarized in Attachment #4.  These support contractor personnel may have access to any data submitted in performance of a contract if one is awarded.  Attachment #5 is a general informational summary of RFI/RFP LOX/Kerosene ORSC rocket engine propulsion system project to assist interested parties. Response Preparation and Transmittal Prospective parties are invited to submit comments or questions to the identified point of contact.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>HELEN MCCULLOUGH, (501)324-5817
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Little Rock District, is planning on issuing a solicitation for construction of the Pine Bluff Arsenal Non-Stockpile Facility, Pine Bluff Arsenal, Jefferson County, Arkansas and is seeking expressions of interest to determ ine if an adequate number of contracting firms will submit a proposals. The solicitation will be issued under NAICS (National American Industry Classification System) Code 233310, size standard $27.5 million. 1.  Purpose.  The Pine Bluff Arsenal Non-Stockpile Facility (PBANSF) is required to house equipment to destroy non-stockpile chemical warfare materiel located at the Pine Bluff Arsenal (PBA).  It will provide the specialized equipment, safety equipment, an d controlled atmosphere necessary to safeguard the public, the operating personnel and the environment during the neutralization of the non-stockpile chemical materiel. 2.  Description of Facility.  This project consists of an approximate 36,400 SF shell structure and associated shed structures, parking lot, access drive, equipment pads, and utility extensions - water, natural gas and electric.  The main building is const ructed of a concrete foundation, concrete slab on grade, and concrete roof and steel roof supports. The exterior wall is a metal stud wall with gypsum sheathing, wall insulation, and exterior metal siding.  There is a 12-inch thick concrete firewall separa ting a part of the facility.  Interior partitions are metal stud with gypsum sheathing.  Finishes include epoxy coated finishes - floors, walls, and ceiling, carpet, ceramic tile, acoustical tile and suspension system, toilet accessories, toilet and shower  partitions. Special features of the PBANSF include heating, ventilation and air conditioning commissioning, special construction and coating in toxic areas, electronic intrusion detection system, video monitoring system, lightning protection, and fire and alarm detect ion system. 3.  Functional Areas.  The proposed design recognizes the following functional areas of the  Non-Stockpile Facility:  Explosive Classification Area (H-1), Hazardous Chemical Areas (H-2) and Support Areas (Business Group B). 	a.  H-1, Explosive Classification Area: H-1 is for that portion of the facility containing explosively configured rounds.  A 4-hour concrete separation wall separates the H-1 area from the H-4 and Business Group B areas and is designed to withstand unexpe cted explosive event.  The building superstructure is supported by a strip and spread footing foundation.  A 4-inch thick reinforced slab-on-grade is used throughout the area with the exception for the Fill Extraction and Detonation Area which houses the E xplosive Containment Chamber and Detonation Chamber trailers.  The roof consists of a 10-inch thick reinforced concrete two-way slab supporting vertical loads and functioning as a diaphragm for lateral loads.  Concrete beams and composite steel and concret e columns support the roof slab.  The 4-hour separation wall is a 12-inch thick reinforced concrete wall that also serves as a bearing wall for the roof and a shear wall for the lateral wind, seismic, blast loads.  The exterior walls enclosing the structur al steel columns consist of metal siding on exterior gypsum sheathed non-load bearing metal studs filled with sprayed insulation. 	b.  H-4, Hazardous Chemical Areas: H-4 is for that portion containing highly toxic materials.  The foundation and floor slab is the same as in the H-1 Area, except the reinforced slab-on-grade in the Agent Treatment and the Process Treatment areas is grea ter due to special loading conditions.  The roof consists of an 8-inch thick reinforced concrete two-way slab supporting vertical loads and functioning as a diaphragm for lateral loads.  Concrete beams and steel columns support the roof slab.  The exterior  walls enclosing the structural steel frames are consist of metal siding on exterior gypsum sheathed non-load bearing metal studs filled with sprayed ins ulation.  	c.  Business Group B, Support Areas: Business Group B is for support services within the facility.  The foundation, roof and exterior walls are the same as in the H-4 areas. 4.  HVAC System.  The HVAC system is vital for orderly and safe facility operations.  It provides for controlled air temperature and pressure, and flows of tempered and filtered air to keep contaminants within special confinement areas.  The objective is t o minimize the spread of contamination and to protect equipment/building areas and the site environs from exposure.  The facility operation involves the use of electronically controlled monitoring and communications systems, which require tempered air envi ronments for stability, accuracy, reliability, availability, and long life.  The facility is designed to provide, to the maximum extent possible, agent confinement through the use effective physical separation between toxic and non-toxic areas and through the use of a cascade ventilation system that uses progressive negative differential pressures.  Areas within the facility with the highest potential for contamination are maintained at the lowest negative pressure.  Airflow cascades progressively from the areas of least probable contamination to the areas of highest probable contamination, while meeting specified temperature, pressure and air change requirements for each functional area.  The buildingÃ¢Â€Â™s design and air-tight construction facilitate the HVAC design goals. 5.  Work Performed by Others.  A separate contract providing processing equipment and the necessary connections including electrical conduit, service, etc to make the process equipment functional will occur following the erection of the shell structure.  T he possibility of dual occupancy of the structure exists during the installation of processing equipment.  The contractor will be required to coordinate the arrival and placement of government furnished equipment indicated (some phasing of work will be req uired to assure this coordination is completed efficiently):  a.  Exterior placed equipment:  Emergency generator, negative pressure filtered ventilation system(s), chemical tanks, and waste tanks  b.  Interior placed equipment:  2 MDU wash chambers, 2 MDU high pressure pumps and 2 MDU support tanks, two steel tanks, 2 reactors, 1 pressure relief vessel, Chemical Processing Trailer, ECC-1 and ECC-2 trailers, and a Detonation Trailer. 6.  Time Restraints.  Time restrictions have been placed on the construction of the facility to comply with the provisions of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction , ratified by Congress in April 1997.  The treaty requires that the Recovered Chemical Materiel (RCM) stored at the PBA must be destroyed by April 2007.   The construction of the facility cannot begin until the RCRA permit application has been approved by the State of Arkansas.  The approval of the application is not expected until May 04.  It is expected to take 21 months to destroy the RCM (12 months systemization and shakedown and 9 months to destroy the RCM).  Therefore, the facility needs to be complet e by July 2005 (15 months for construction). This contract is unrestricted.  Firms that are interested in submitting a proposal and feel they are qualified to perform the required services, should submit the following information:  Company Name, Address, Phone Number, Point-of-Contact and Bonding Cap acity.  Information should be submitted via e-mail to helen.mccullough@usace.army.mil.  Information may be faxed to 501-324-5680. After review, a solicitation will be issued and all interested parties must register to receive the solicitation at https://eb s.swl.usace.army.mil/advertised solicitations.  Currently there is no solicitation available and no further project information is available.

<DESC>The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), under contract to the United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, is seeking information from companies, educational institutions, research and development laboratories (public, and private), or other sources about commercially available handheld equipment or near-commercial technologies that may be used for the detection and/or identification of radioactive materials and special nuclear materials at border crossings and ports of entry. We are interested in information on systems that would be usable for improved sensing of radioactive materials in railroad cars, shipping containers (all configurations), commercial vehicles of all sizes and shapes, and personal vehicles of all sizes and shapes.  Specifically, we are looking for information regarding the expected technical capability and effectiveness of currently (or soon to be) available handheld inspection instrumentation with respect to expected threats given the distance, shielding, etc. conditions that are typically found at border crossings and ports of entry. Operational issues, specifically detection probabilities and identification probabilities for typical measurement conditions are of particular interest. Other issues that might impact operations, such as required reliability and robustness, training requirements (must not require extensive user training), and health and safety issues are also of interest. Participation does not imply any obligation on the part of the Government. Proprietary information will be protected to the greatest extent provided by law. Interested organizations/companies/institutions are encouraged to respond to this notice by providing a short written summary (no longer than ten pages) of their equipment capabilities.  Please send a copy of the summary by mail, fax, or e-mail to: Mr. Mark Panisko, M/S P8-20, PNNL, P. O. Box 999, Richland, WA 99352 by 11 July 2003.

<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service-Arkansas State Office intends to conduct a cost comparison in accordance with OMB-approved USDA Express Review Study procedures. The study is  for mailroom support functions in Little Rock, Arkansas, NAICS Code 561210. Major mailroom support tasks include general mailroom operations (receiving, sorting, distributing, collecting, and sending mail), office reproduction services, vehicle maintenance services, central supply room operations, and pickup and delivery services. The USDA Express Review  process is based on the assumption that the commercial activity under study is regularly performed under contract by commercial activities at firm fixed prices and that existing Federal contracts can be used, with only minor modification, to level and define the scope of the competition and avoid the need to develop a new PWS or a formal solicitation. NRCS is seeking to locate commercial businesses that have experience and also have current government contracts for  mailroom support services. All interested and capable parties that have expertise in mailroom support services should respond VIA E-MAIL to the Contracting Officer soila.reando@ar.usda.gov or terry.franks@ar.usda.gov with a list of their 1) contract number 2) Federal Agency  name and point of contact 3) the firm fixed price of each contract 4) the period of performance covered and 5) the size and business status. NOTE: This is NOT a SOLICITATION or request for proposal; however, depending on the results of the streamlined cost comparison, a solicitation may be issued at a later date.  Any questions should be submitted via EMAIL ONLY (no phone calls please) to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Soila Reando or Ms. Terry Franks.

<DESC>This is a request for information to locate potential sources for 5/8" x 150' non-metallic synthetic fiber tapes. Background:  The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency, Kansas City Commodity Office, Warehouse Licensing & Examination Division, inspects grain silos in America's farm communities. There are approximately 60 warehouse examiners located in various geographic areas of the United States.  The tapes are utilized to accurately measure grain contained in upright grain silos. A spark in the dusty environment has been known to set off an explosion. Measurements taken with the tapes are used to determine volume of grain contained in each grain silo.  Accuracy is important in order to determine whether the grain elevator has enough grain in the facility to protect all depositors who chose to store grain at the facility.
  The examiners have been using a cloth tape made by Lufkin, but the manufacturer has discontinued the product.  Fiberglass tapes are unsuitable due to stiffness in cold weather.  The USDA has non-sparking tape reels manufactured to accommodate 5/8" wide tapes 150' in length.  The USDA is in need of non-metallic synthetic fiber tapes that are non-conductive and resists breaking.  The tape must have large easy-to-read black and red markings on a white or yellow background marked in feet and 10ths of feet.  In the past the USDA has purchased approximately 100 each of these tapes per year. The Government Point of Contact (POC) is Jerry Shead, 816-926-6106.  Response to this RFI is requested no later than June 30, 2003.  Any technical questions should be submitted by e-mail to jwshead@kcc.usda.gov. Currently no solicitation exists.  This is strictly a Request for Information and does not constitute any obligation on behalf of the Government to ever issue a solicitation.

<SUBJECT>--Portable, Low Power, Micro-Distillation Water Treatment & Recycling Unit
<DESC>NA The US Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division, in support of the U.S. Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command (USA SBCCOM), intends to conduct negotiations and award a purchase order to Ovation Products Corporation, 395 Eas t Dunstable Road, Nashua, NH  03062 of the basis of other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation part 6.302-1.  The NAICS Code is 339111.  The standard business size is 500.  This procurement is for the acquisition  of one Portable, Low Power, Micro-Distillation Water Treatment & Recycling Unit.  Ovation Products Corporation has recently produced and patented a micro-distillation device that meets the specific requirements of an Environmental Security Technology Cert ification Program (ESTCP) for a portable, low-power system to efficiently reduce greywater generation in field food service operations by 75% or more.  This system will serve as one of two alternative greywater treatment technologies that will be assessed under the ESTCP effort.  Technical testing will include individual and comparative assessment of performance versus size, weight, and cost factors.  The primary performance factor is the volumetric reduction of greywater that must be backhauled from the ty pical sanitation process that is required to support a field kitchen.  A treated water effluent flow rate of 10 gallons per minute represents the baseline flow rate performance parameter.  Though potable-quality water is desired, the baseline water quality  parameters are somewhat less stringent.  Alternative filtration, membrane separation, and distillation technologies have been identified and assessed during the last three years under a Greywater Reduction Tech Base program.   This testing unit is critica l to the completion of comparative testing and evaluation under the ESTCP effort.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  However, the Government will consider all quotations received within three (3) days after date of publication of this announcement.  A  determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competi tive procurement.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U. S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division, ATTN:  AMSSB-ACC-NS/Peggy Dube, Natick, MA  01760-5011 no later  than 5:00 p.m. EST on 17 June 2003.  Inquiries may be made via e-mail to peggy.dube@natick.army.mil.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.  See FBO Note 22.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is a Request for Quotation, reference number 5TS5702C253.  The requirement is restricted to HUBZone small business concerns.  NAICS Code 624190, Other Individual and Family Services, applies.  This requirement is for a fixed price contract.  The GSA/FTS, Region 5 is announcing its intent to issue a firm fixed price contract for developing Community Capacity Action Plans in support of each Air Mobility Command base: Scott AFB , IL; Travis AFB, CA; McChord AFB, WA; Fairchild AFB, WA; McConnell AFB, KS; Pope AFB, NC; Charleston AFB, SC; McDill AFB, FL; Dover AFB, DE; McGuire AFB, NJ; Grand Forks AFB, ND; and Andrews AFB, MD.  The United States Air Force has long recognized the strong link between quality-of-life, particularly family and community support, and readiness and retention of Air Force personnel and provided broad-based programs and services in support of these outcomes.  Historically, key Air Force human service agencies are utilizing Community Needs Assessment (CNA) to plan, resource and guide programming on behalf of Air Force members, their families and communities.   The current CNA surveys are being administered and are scheduled to be complete August 2003.  Survey information will be provided when available.  Significant modifications in the structure of the CNA have been made to provide the community results data that facilitates planning, programming and resourcing of human service efforts consistent with these frameworks.  Key domain areas for the 2003 Community Assessment may include family adaptation, health and well being, personnel preparedness, spiritual wellness, sense of community, etc.   With the emergence of the Air Force Integrated Delivery System (IDS), which provides a mechanism for collaboration across all AF human service agencies to deliver services, increasingly focus has shifted from an assessment of needs to the assessment of results achieved within the community.  Currently, installation IDS teams across the AF are being trained to deliver and monitor services using the community capacity and results management models.  The IDS team is a diverse group and may include representatives from the family support center, child and youth services, chapel, family advocacy, mental health, health promotions, legal office, public affairs, and first sergeants.  IDS teams will have web access to all assessment reports.  Teams are required to analyze the data and develop a Community Capacity Action Plan in accordance with Air Force Instruction 90-501, Community Action Information Board and Integrated Delivery System.  Analysis should include the results from the 1999-2000 needs assessment as well as the 2003 data..  The IDS will complete all required demographic data in the plan and the contractor shall facilitate the collaborative development of the remainder of the plan.  The goal of the plan is to establish community and program results that will enhance readiness and retention, increase family adaptation, and strengthen the base sense of community.  Each AMC Base IDS team will identify no more than four community results.  Contractor shall identify result indicators and evaluation tools.  Contractor shall maintain a visual record of key discussion points, decisions, action plans, and a summary of training/meeting results.  The summary shall be electronically forwarded to the POC within three weeks of the training.  Any necessary travel by contractor personnel shall be the responsibility of the contractor.  Contractor proposal shall include and identify all travel costs.   Contractor shall visit each Air Mobility Command (AMC) base for a period of two days to assist IDS teams write their respective Community Capacity Action Plans based on the community assessment survey results.  The Family Support Center director will be the point of contact (POC) at each base.  The POC will arrange the meeting place, provide audio-visual equipment and office supplies; the POC will notify all base IDS members of the time, place, and any required pre-work.  Contractor training/meeting dates shall be coordinated with AMC/DPFF who will further coordinate with the AMC IDS team and Family Support Center Directors.  The 2-day contractor trainings/meetings shall be scheduled in a group setting for eight hours each day.    Deliverables for this task shall be: (1) a summary report of training/meetings, and (2) a final draft of the community capacity action plan.  Delivery and acceptance of all items shall be F.O.B. Destination. The period of performance for this contract task is 1 August 2003 through 29 February 2004.
