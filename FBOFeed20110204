These overlay values will be changing in real time and must update on the video screen in real time.<br /><br /><br />Example: Video one is a side view of the tunnel. We want to display Mach Number in the upper right corner of the video screen. The mach number is changing as we run, therefore the value displayed on the video screen must change accordingly. Video two is a top view of the model. We want to display Total Temperature in the lower center of the video screen and Total Pressure next to that. Total Temperature and Total Pressure are changing as we run, therefore the values displayed on the video screen must change accordingly. All three of the parameters will be sent to the overlay system together. The software will be programmed to send to Mach Number to one channel and the Temp and Pressure to another channel. <br />

<DESC><p>The intent of this solicitation and any resultant contract is to obtain services for one light, high-fixed-wing multi engine aircraft fully operated by qualified pilot and equipped to meet specifications for special use missions for support of the Region 6 Forest Health Program on Public and State Lands. During the Mandatory Availability Period (45 days) and any extensions thereof, the aircraft will be made available for the exclusive use of the Government. It is anticipated that there will be between 100 and 140 flight hours.</p>
<p>The light fixed wing multi engine aircraft will be used as a platform for the government to complete insect and disease detection surveys in the states of Oregon and Washington and may also be used for other project, and administrative flights. Work will be accomplished Monday through Friday. It is anticipated that work will begin approximately the week of July 11 2011.</p>
<p>OVERVIEW OF FOREST INSECTS AND DISEASES AERIAL SURVEY MISSION</p>
<p>(1) Systematic aerial detection surveys have been conducted in the Pacific Northwest annually since 1947. Approximately 45 million forested acres are surveyed each year throughout Oregon and Washington. The Washington survey is conducted using a contract aircraft and pilot and covers approximately 20 million forested acres over all ownerships.</p>
<p>(2) Two observers (government employees) on opposite sides of the aircraft look for and map "tree damage" to a distance of two miles out. Observers are looking for signs or symptoms (colors, patterns, timing, etc.) of current year mortality, defoliation, disease, and or weather damage. Observations are recorded on a 1:100,000 USGS map or digitally on Government Furnished computers. The majority of flights are conducted on a grid pattern. The grid pattern employed in Washington involves flying parallel flight lines spaced four miles apart. In this system of flying it is very important for the pilot to hold a precise heading (along section lines, lines of latitude or longitude) as determined by the lead observer. Typically, the aircraft is flown at 100-120 mph, and 1,000 feet above ground level, but often ranges from between 500 and 2,000 feet AGL. Mountain contouring and ridge flying are other techniques used in more deeply dissected terrain such as the Olympic and North Cascade Mountains.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p><br />The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) located at MacDill Air Force Base (AFB), Florida intends to award a sole source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to Raytheon Company, 1010 Production Road, Fort Wayne, IN 46808-4106 for the purchase of repair material and sustainment of the AN/PSC-5D Multi-band, Multi-Mission Radio (MBMMR) systems, NSN 5821-01-477-6237 currently purchased and fielded by the Government under previous contract efforts utilizing the authority provided at FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii).</p>
<p>Programs are in the planning stages to replace the AN/PSC-5D systems, however, given current schedules for those programs and funding profiles over the FYDP, a substantial number of the radios will remain in use by SOF units and therefore, will require sustainment for the next decade. To qualify new vendors that could support these requirements would require a) the Government to procure full technical data rights to Raytheon proprietary technical documentation assuming they would be agreeable to such procurement b) make that data available to potential new vendors and c) then conduct a full and open competition. This would cause substantial duplication of program cost, increased schedule timeframes and would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling these SOF requirements. These additional costs and delays to the Government are not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>Sustainment shall include a contractor depot repair capability, field technical services, operator/maintainer training, and development, test and installation of approved modifications and upgrades if required. The Government also intends to procure ancillary replenishment spares and maintenance replacement end items over the period of the contract in order to repair and maintain the existing systems.</p>
<p>The current anticipated maximum contract ceiling is $15M over the entire 5 year period. This IDIQ contract is anticipated to be awarded prior to September 2011 with a period of performance of 25 Sep 2011 - 24 Sep 2016.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement prior to the closing date of this announcement which shall be considered by the agency to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Deanna Cox, deanna.cox@socom.mil with a copy to Mr. Jon Katz, jonathan.katz@socom.mil and Mr. Valentin Torello, valentin.torello@socom.mil. All questions and/or communications shall be conducted by e-mail. All responses will be considered prior to making a final award determination.</p>

<DESC>A-10/F-16 Three-Dimensional Audio System/Subsystems
<p>This notification is for market research purposes to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete the requirement for Hill Air Force Base, UT and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be accomplished. This is not a request for proposal or an invitation for bid.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Synopsis is to identify potential sources and information on existing Three-Dimensional Audio and Active and Electronic Noise Reduction System/Subsystems suitable that have already been developed or may be modified from other Aerospace Industry solutions to meet the agency requirements for Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) A-10 and F-16 aircraft.</p>
<p>The Three-Dimensional Audio capability is for the pilot to maintain situational awareness of sounds in three-dimensional space. For example, the pilot should be able to use directional auditory cueing to be able to spatially separate different communication devices in the cockpit (if the pilot has two radios, one may sound as if it is coming from the lower right side of the cockpit while the other may sound as if it is coming from the upper left side). Another example may be that the pilot would be able to hear a threat warning indication from the direction of the threat source (if an enemy missile is launched from the pilot's lower right side, the pilot would hear the sound as if it were coming from that specific direction in the cockpit).</p>
<p>The requirement will be for providing a readily available three-dimensional audio system using the latest Military and/or Commercial off-the Shelf (COTS) technology with minor modifications for system/subsystem integration only as part of an Operational Utility Evaluation effort (OUE).</p>
<p>Proposed hardware must be a proven system that is already in use on military aircraft and meet applicable environmental specifications (MIL-STD-810 Environmental Qualification; MIL-STD-464 EMI/EMC Qualification; A220R0307 Northrup Grumman A-10 Shock, Vibration, And Acoustics Qual; JSSG-2009 Department of Defense Joint Services Specification Guide).</p>
<p>Proposed hardware must also be backwards compatible with existing aircrew equipment (i.e. pilot's flight helmet) and meet applicable life support specifications (MIL-HDBK-46855A Human Engineering Program Process and Procedures; MIL-STD-1472 Human Engineering; A-10-COS-LDB-97-026 A-10 Cockpit Optimization Study; MIL-L-85762 Night Vision Imaging Specification; 162S310001A A-10 PIDs).</p>
<p>Any three-dimensional audio system must include provisions and plans for permanent installation in such a configuration that maximizes form-fit replacement of existing systems. Three-dimensional audio system will be federated from aircraft operational flight program (OFP) to the maximum extent possible.</p>
<p>Preference is for hardware and software which can be owned, managed, and modified by USAF for other potential applications.</p>
<p>Objective of OUE is to demonstrate, validate, and qualify integration of potential solutions within 18 months for recommendation for fielding options in the near future or 2-4 years. Actual fielding decision is beyond the scope, intent, or authority of this synopsis.</p>
<p>Three-dimensional audio system requirements:</p>
<p>Threshold:<br />1. Digital intercom system upgrade<br />2. Active and electronic noise reduction<br />3. Three-dimensional spatial separation for up to four audio channels<br />4. Three-dimensional auditory threat cueing from aircraft missile warning system and radar warning receiver.</p>
<p>Objective:<br />1. Three-dimensional auditory cueing to aircraft formation via data link.</p>
<p>Platform requirements:</p>
<p>Threshold: A-10C</p>
<p>Objective: F-16B30.</p>
<p>Interested parties capable of providing this three-dimensional audio system, which meet or exceed the above requirements, shall provide a Statement of Capability (SOC) that demonstrates the existing capability to provide, modify, and sustain the system and a description of system capabilities.</p>

The investigation skills and law enforcement officer insights are twofold.  First, the contractor shall assist in structuring, building and populating the forensic accounting effort through case files/databases, the linkages, and the methods, techniques and intuitions on what to look for/how to identify possible anomalies.  This information will assist government officials in providing recommendations based on the facts that will feed the legal, criminal and intelligence groups.  Second, the contractor is required to have the skill sets to understand and anticipate all types of information and facts as well as the structuring of the information, the need for completeness, accuracy and reporting that the legal, criminal investigators and law enforcement groups associated with this effort will require.  The Contractor shall comply with all U.S. and Host Nation laws, regulations, policies, procedures, and guidelines in the performance of this requirement, and shall continuously meet US Military Service Standards unless otherwise stated.  <BR><BR>The contractor will focus on select prime contracts in Regional Command South and will attempt to gain as much information as possible about the sub-contracting networks of those select prime contracts.  The contractor will be expected to take existing prime contractor information, Government provided investigation information, and Government provided intelligence information and enters it into a database.   The contractor will use the databases to capture and analyze each prime contract (including the subcontracting networks and flow of funds from the prime contractor through all tiers of subcontractors), develop contract profiles, company profiles including aliases, related parties and beneficiaries, individual profiles including aliases, related parties and beneficiaries and the linkages between these profiles.  These will be used to also develop decomposition maps and also to identify linkages to the subcontracting networks, aliases and related parties as well as the association of the flow of funds from the prime contractor through all tiers of subcontractors, related parties and direct and indirect recipients of benefits.  This data linkage development and data mining is proactive and reactive - driven by the inputs, inquires and direction from the legal, criminal investigation, contracting, intelligence and overseeing customer. <BR><BR>Simultaneously to the review of Prime Contracts, engagement with the Intelligence cell shall be conducted to understand the collected information related to designated parties including the capture of alter egos, alias, related relationships that can factor into the forensic driven relationship mappings.<BR>The Contractor shall develop the factual support for the identification of the money movement and the recipients of funds.

The USAHEC is accountable for all Army-owned historical textiles of the Army Heritage Museum (AHM) located at the U. S. Army War College (AWC) in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The Army's historic museum inventory consists of more than 20,000 historic textiles dating from the Pre-Revolutionary War period to present day including: flags, uniforms, headgear, footwear, covers and liners, tents, bedrolls, knapsacks, camouflage netting, soldier souvenirs and captured materials, ribbon bars, medals, and composite military equipment and accessories containing textile elements. In addition, the collection includes archaeological and ethnographic textiles, modern materials, experimental synthetic and semi-synthetic textile materials, painted or decorated textiles, and other historic textiles.<BR>The museum textile collection requires professional handling, transport, survey, storage, documentation, and conservation treatment to preserve the historical integrity and stability of the collection. Conservation treatment of these textiles requires professional museum-quality conservation expertise in organic materials (ex. cotton, wool, silk, etc.), inorganic materials (ex. metal threads, nylon, polyester, fiberglass, carbon fibers, etc.) and semi-synthetics/modern materials (ex. plastic, rayon, vulcanized fibers, etc.). Composite objects may include treatment of other materials in conjunction with textiles, such as metals, leather, plastics, glass, and other organic and inorganic materials. The conservation projects require standard conservation quality documentation, conservation treatment, collection condition surveys, photography, scientific analysis, historic and scientific research, custom fabrication of exhibit prep, mounts, and mannequins. Construction of proper packing and museum level shipping techniques is expected.<BR>In addition to conservation treatments, special reports and scientific or investigative services shall be performed on an as-needed basis.

Resulting survey reports shall have a format agreed upon by all parties prior to commencement of the survey and be provided to the COR on a gold-coated archival CD or DVD and 2 printed readable hard copies on archival paper with no font less than 8 point font.<BR>Protection of Government Records: Extreme care must be exercised in handling all collection materials in conformance with approved laboratory practices and procedures for museum materials as recognized by the museum industry. The contractor is responsible for the proper care, handling and maintenance of all Army materials furnished by the Army in accordance with archival practices and FAR Part 45, Government Property. The contractor must ensure that collection materials are stored and handled in accordance with the Code of Federal regulations and shall be responsible for damage caused by negligence (e.g., rough handling or improper storage) or failure to adhere to the requirements of the contract. <BR>Analytical Testing of Materials<BR>At times it is necessary to test materials for the purposes of material identification, degradation or corrosion products, material compatibility, and other measures that guide the investigation of a textile before and during conservation treatment. Non-destructive material analysis or micro sampling is allowed as necessary to determine all materials used in the production of the textile or previous campaigns of repair if relevant to the treatment choices and procedures. Whenever possible, the Contractor must utilize non-destructive methods of analysis when investigating the condition issues of a textile. Practice must conform to industry standards. Permission to sample and cost estimates for analytical services must be submitted to the COR and before sampling ensues. Only the KO can make the final determination as to whether testing shall ensue.<BR>It may be necessary to make informed decisions about the treatment path using micro-destructive sampling techniques after all non-destructive techniques are exhausted. Arrangements must be made in advance for a working relationship with a conservation scientist or analytical laboratory. Discrete spot-testing of cleaning solutions to determine: the solubility of soiling; the identification of textile fibers, coatings, weights, dyes, and mordents; paints, coatings, or other auxiliary materials may be necessary. Sampling fibers or paint sections for microscopy may be necessary, as well as other types of sampling to identify materials, identify HAZMAT issues, or to understand material degradation processes and products. Practice must conform to industry standards. Permission to sample and cost estimates for analytical services must be submitted to the COR and before sampling ensues. Only the KO can make the final determination as to whether sampling shall ensue.<BR>All methods of analysis shall be revealed in the corresponding documentation.<BR>Documentation. Copies of spectra, micrographs, lab results, data, and interpretation of results shall be included.<BR>All extant samples, slides, thin or thick sections, electron microscopy stubs, etc. shall be provided to the USAHEC along with the Treatment Report unless destroyed in the process of analysis.<BR>Conservation Surveys<BR>The contractor may be required to conduct full or partial collection condition surveys on uniforms, bedrolls, tents, headgear, footwear, flags, and other textiles. <BR>Conservation specifications and treatment steps within awarded task orders may include but are not limited to the following specifications:<BR>All treatments shall maintain an acceptable degree of reversibility.<BR>In all treatments, protection of the integrity and history of use of the textile shall not be compromised.<BR>Removal of previous failing or unsightly treatments and restorations is required where appropriate. Historic repairs shall not be removed unless they place the textile in structural jeopardy. Loss compensation must conform to industry standards for reversibility, minimal intervention, and not be so visually deceptive that it cannot be identified within 2 feet of visual range.<BR>Auxiliary supports used to support original structural materials must be as physically and chemically compatible as possible, and not cause further stress or damage to the textile.<BR>Some textiles or composite objects may require disassembly in order to clean and stabilize and shall be reassembled properly. Original threads that must be cut shall be carefully documented, retained, labeled, and returned to USAHEC.<BR>Techniques:<BR>Surface cleaning by vacuum, molecular sponge, anti-static cloth, brush, air stream, or other dry methods may be necessary. Aqueous or solvent methods compatible to removing soil, old repairs, archaeological deposits, or grime is to be selected according to the principles of solubility, spot testing, and according to the type of materials present and condition of the textile. Cleaning shall not damage or remove original surface materials whenever possible.<BR>Consolidation of flaking or unstable paints, rubber, powdering or cracking leather, paper, or other materials, may be required.<BR>Treatment of corrosion for metal threads, rivets, rings, or metal components shall involve the most current techniques, avoiding aggressive methods to strip metals to the bare metal surface. In most cases, air or water jet systems with abrasives are unacceptable as they pit surfaces and offer little control. <BR>Any mold, excess moisture, or insects found shall be removed. The contractor may be required to treat pest-infested textiles and composite objects with textiles with anoxia or freezing treatments, as appropriate to the type and stability of the materials.<BR>In the case of damage to the textiles collections resulting from a disaster situation (fire, water damage, or other) at the USAHEC (and/or MHI, AHM, <BR>AWC), the contractor may be required to perform pick-up and emergency treatments of select collections, but will not be required to be the first responder, primary vendor for the whole site recovery effort, or project lead in the disaster recovery effort. Additional advice and on-site support assistance may be required of the textile conservator.<BR>Associated treatment activities which may be performed on site or at the contractors premises (as designated in each task order) include: research on textiles, creating textile mounts and supports as well as mounting textiles for exhibits; and treatment of textiles which are too sensitive to travel, are oversize, or fixed in position to an artifact or immobile, oversize artifact (ex. textile screen on a tank, upholstery in a vehicle).<BR>All performed interventions must comply with Army Regulations 190-11, 190-51, and 870-20.<BR>Special instructions for textiles in combination with historic objects, macro objects, ordnance, weapons, transport vehicles, communication equipment, scientific instruments:<BR>Stabilization from physical insecurity or chemical deterioration may be required for all types of materials in direct contact with textile in a historic object. <BR>Restoring full functionality of historic objects with textile components is not necessary unless specifically requested by the COR. Examples include: restoring movement of textile-covered seats in vehicles; parachutes able to open and close; headgear with textile corded wiring still functional for communications; and repaired gun slings accommodating the weight of the firearm. The treatment goal is stability, not restoration of functionality.<BR>The contractor shall provide guidance and input in the development and review of institutional documents on procedures such as the Disaster Plan or Conservation and Preservation Long-Term Plan for routine maintenance of the textile collection. On-site examination, analysis, surveys, measurements, photography, consultation, and result reports may be requested. <BR>Environmental and physical protection recommendations for the proper care of individual components that may be inherently sensitive or unstable are welcome. When necessary to preserve original materials, some components may be replicated and installed in order not to sacrifice the original materials if permanent damage is predicted for the planned exhibiting or housing of the textile. All original materials must be returned to the Army. Reproductions must be clearly stated and photographed in the reports.<BR>Technical Studies<BR>For some treatments, historic research into the manufacturing techniques, history and use of the textile, and investigation into provenance may be necessary to guide the course of treatment so that historic integrity of the textile is preserved. The Contractor may be required to use the MHI archives and other sources to unravel the history of a textile before treatment ensues. Often the investigation may pair historic evidence with analytical testing and investigations. All findings shall be reported to the COR. Formal reports shall be made in accordance with 5.2 Documentation.<BR>Conservation Framing and Exhibit Mounts<BR>It may be requested of the contractor to provide some textiles and objects with textile components with special conservation-grade framing such as pressure mounts under UV-blocking glass, or construction of a custom support or cradle for exhibition. The design must be proposed in writing prior to execution and include a concept drawing with dimensions and materials listed. Complex mounts may require a small sample version. The process of design evolution may require some meetings in-person and incur some travel to USAHEC to discuss with staff.<BR>Other Deliverables<BR>The contractor shall provide monthly reports on their labs environmental conditions (temperature and relative humidity) to the COR by mail or fax to ensure compliance to the contract environmental requirements, which are: lab environment controlled to 62-68 F (+5 F is ideal but +7 degrees is acceptable) and 50% RH (+5% is ideal but +7% RH is acceptable).<BR>Education<BR>Some projects and treatments may be considered as candidates for staff and public education. This would involve summaries of the treatment, demonstrations of the object before and after, and technical discussions or demonstrations. The contractor may be asked in advance to allow access for USAHEC staff to photograph at the contractors lab, or allow audio-visual media contractors of the US Army War College (Metro Productions) to film work in progress. No materials belonging to non-USAHEC clients will be filmed, or anything that would compromise the safety of the contractor, the contractor's premises, or security and alarm systems. The end results may be made available on the USAHEC webpage, used for internal Army or National Guard training purposes, and Army Museum Memo publications. The content and scope will be discussed and agreed upon by all parties in advance in writing to generally include a script, final editing approvals, and dissemination vehicles for the end product along with a timeframe for general use. The contractor is not required to have any video or voice-over experience.<BR>Technical Exhibits<BR>When necessary, special materials may be specified in awarded task orders for re-housing, treatments, or other projects to promote a high standard of material stability. <BR>When necessary, instructions such as dimension restriction may be specified by the COR in awarded task orders for re-housing, mounts for storage and exhibit, or other projects to promote compatibility with exhibit plans and storage space. <BR>Quality and Evaluation Criteria<BR>All treatments will be reviewed for acceptability by expert conservation Government personnel. Treatment must be reversible to an acceptable degree, must stabilize the textile, compensate for loss when required, be of sound methods and materials, and to the standards and Best Practices of the industry of professional museum conservation. At the completion of work and upon receipt of the textiles inspection will be conducted by the COR and compared to the conservation proposal for treatment and final treatment report to determine adherence to the contract. <BR>All treatments shall maintain an acceptable degree of reversibility. In all treatments, protection of the integrity and history of use of the textile shall not be compromised. Loss compensation must conform to industry standards for reversibility, minimal intervention, and not be so visually deceptive that it cannot be identified within 2 feet of visual range.<BR>In the case of a questionable or unacceptable treatment, review may include other conservators, curators, and scientists within the US Government and professional associates. Unacceptable work may result in re-performance. If further damage has resulted by negligence, unprofessional work, unacceptable techniques, or accident, the Army reserves the right to legally recover damages from the Contractor up to the market value of the textile.<BR>Treatments must conform to the ethics and guidelines for practice of the:<BR>American Institute of Conservation for Historic and Artistic Works (AIC) <BR>The period of performance for each task order will be defined in that task order, stemming from the Contractor's proposal as accepted/negotiated by the Government.<BR>Travel, Transportation<BR>At the time that a Task Order Request (TOR) is issued to the contractor, the TOR will include the determination made by the Government COR whether or not the museum textile will be sent to the Contractor's facility or remain at the Government's site for evaluation in order for the contractor to submit a valid and complete Task Order Execution Plan. <BR>The contractor shall travel to the Government site (US Army Heritage and Education Center-USAHEC) in order to perform on-site conservation treatments and conditions surveys as required in individual Task Orders.<BR>The contractor shall be required to provide for the transportation of museum textiles from the Government site to their facility. All textiles moved to and from the USAHEC must be accomplished according to standard museum practice professional level for packing, crating, and transport through a commercial, experienced, reputable art shipper, or contractor's own transport meeting the same standards. Upon govt. approval of acceptance of a contractor TOEP for task orders executed under this contract, the vendor shall have no more than 15 business days to pick up the textiles from the USAHEC if the task order requires the work to be done in the contractor's lab.<BR>The contractor may be required to travel to the Government's site in order to conduct on-site conservation treatments of oversize, fixed, or fragile textiles and to perform on-site condition surveys as per PWS section 3.4; exhibit mounting and exhibit support fabrication, research on the history and manufacture techniques of the textile.<BR>Government review and acceptance of materials: Delivery of materials back to the USAHEC must be coordinated in advance through the COR. After delivered goods are received, the USAHEC COR, COTR, and other interested parties have 20 business days to review and perform quality inspection to determine adherence to the contract and TO. Incomplete or unacceptable quality of work may require re-performance. Artifacts are reviewed in-house with conservation and museum staff when the treatment reports are available for quality control of treatments and other contract products. The contractor shall be consulted for any questions about the treatments and products if there are any issues within 20 business days of receipt of all TO products. A final internal decision to accept or not the treatments and products is made to the KO prior to closure of the TO or request for re-performance.<BR>

<DESC>This partnering synopsis solicits potential partners to participate in a proposaldevelopment activity addressing the goals and objectives in response to the NASA ScienceMission Directorate, Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES)Announcement of Opportunity (AO) found at:(http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId={9636473D-602B-F49F-ABDC-5A26F36D08CD}&path=open) and specifically the Earth Science Programopportunity of Advanced Component Technology found at:(http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=221215/A.1%20Earth%20Sci%20Overview.pdf). Earth Science Program investigations address NASAs science goals as described in EarthScience and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond(http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11820.html ) and Responding to the Challenge of Climate andEnvironmental Change: NASAs Plan for a Climate-Centric Architecture for EarthObservations and Applications from Space(http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2010/07/01/Climate_Architecture_Final.pdf). Advanced Component Technology investigations will be led by a Principal Investigator andwill be comprised of scientists in partnerships, potentially involving NASA Centers,academia, and industry.Participation in this partnering synopsis is open to all categories of U.S. and non-U.S.organizations, including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit institutions,the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as NASA Centers and other U.S. GovernmentAgencies.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Other MinorityUniversities (OMUs), small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), veteran-owned smallbusinesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBzone small businesses,and women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) are encouraged to apply.  Participation bynon-U.S. organizations is welcome but subject to NASAs policy of no exchange of funds,in which each government supports its own national participants and associated costs. This opportunity is focused on technology development of an optical receiver to be usedwith a Doppler lidar for satellite-based global wind scale profiling (3-D Winds mission).The purpose of this announcement is to enable LaRC to obtain potential partners toparticipate in the development of the technical concept, proposal, and implementation ofthe optical receiver design, build, and testing. In particular NASA LaRC is seekingpotential partners to develop and provide a telescope to be used with a coherent Dopplerlidar.Key attributes of the telescope include a primary mirror aperture of 0.5-m diameter foruse with a coherent Doppler lidar at 2-micron wavelength.  An off-axis optical design isenvisioned such as a Dall-Kirkham geometry.  The telescope is used to both expand theoutgoing laser transmitter beam and collect backscatter from the atmosphere.  A low f/#(less than 2) is desired and is a topic for the design and research effort.  Diffractionlimited optical quality is desired to preserve the phase-front of laser and backscatterlight.	Beam expanding magnification is another parameter to be designed, given a laserinput size of 6-mm 1/e^2 diameter (a beam expander before the telescope may be used forpre-expansion).  The telescopes optics must withstand without damage a pulse energy of250-mJ at 10-Hz pulse repetition rate and 200-ns pulsewidth. These attributes are provided as a guide, however, the final system design submitted forthe Advanced Component Technology proposal will be developed between the selected partnerand LaRC. All responses provided should have demonstrated heritage in telescopedevelopment. LaRC will require each selected provider to submit a detailed letter of commitmentoutlining their contribution, which will be included in the proposal. LaRC anticipatesissuing contracts or other agreements to the partners provided the concept is selectedfor implementation. Provider selections will be made by LaRC based on the listed criteria in the followingorder of importance:(1) Relevant Experience and Past Performance: This criterion evaluates the Offerorsrelevant technical experience and past performance in similar development activities.Provide a description of relevant technical experience including a summary of significantachievements and technical performance. The Offeror shall specifically discuss therelevance of their experience in reference to the design and development of telescopesand optical systems.  All responses provided should have demonstrated heritage intelescope development. (2) Cost and Schedule Control: This criterion evaluates the Offerors ability to controlboth cost and schedule. The Offeror should provide evidence of successfully controllingcost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of managementprocesses in this area.(3) Technical Capability, Key Personnel and Facilities: This criterion evaluates theOfferors technical capability to perform the development proposed, the availability andadequacy of key personnel, and the availability and adequacy of facilities. The Offerorshall describe the technical capability, facilities and key personnel available tosupport the proposal and mission development. NASA will not pay for technical assessment or proposal preparation costs incurred bypotential partners. It is expected that the selected partners will participate activelyin the proposal process and that selection of the proposal for implementation wouldresult in contract(s) for the selected providers. This synopsis opportunity does not represent a guarantee to selection of award of anycontracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the informationsolicited.It is expected that provider(s) selected would provide (no cost to NASA), conceptualdesigns, technical data, proposal inputs, schedule and cost estimates consistent with theNASA Earth Science guidelines as described in the Announcement of Opportunity.Responses to this synopsis shall be limited to 5 pages in not less than 12-point font.Responses shall address each of the aforementioned evaluation criteria. A cover page thatclearly identifies the area or areas of interest addressed by the response does not counttowards the total allocated page count.All responses shall be submitted to LaRC electronically via e-mail by 5:00 PM EasternStandard Time on February 18, 2011 to: e-mail: grady.j.koch@nasa.govName: Grady Koch ande-mail: teresa.m.hass@nasa.govName: Teresa Hass Technical and programmatic questions should be directed to:Name: Grady KochPhone: (757) 864-3850e-mail: grady.j.koch@nasa.gov Procurement questions should be directed to:Name: Teresa Hass Title: Contract Specialist/Contracting OfficerPhone: (757) 864-8496 Fax: (757) 864-8863e-mail: teresa.m.hass@nasa.gov

Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to provide the below services within 30 days after receipt of purchase order.

Interested parties are expected to review this notice to familiarize yourself with the requirements of this project; failure to do so will be at your firms own risk.
 
Background:

The Assay Development and Screening Technology (ADST) Laboratory, part of the NIH Center for Translational Therapeutics (NCTT), is requesting a NanoTemper Monolith instrument. This instrument is needed to handle the existing protocols of cell-based assays established by the NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC), a branch of the NCTT. The implementation of existing technology and protocols will ensure consistency and accuracy between all laboratories under the NCTT. 

The ADST Laboratory is working to develop novel assays as well as to apply existing assays to a spectrum of rare and neglected diseases under the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Disease (TRND) initiative.  This development of target specific cell based assays for rare and neglected diseases must also remain compatible with the automated robotic qHTS facility at the NCGC (NIH Chemical Genomic Center) to insure the efficient and accurate transfer of assays between laboratories.

Description/Specifications:

NanoTemper.Monolith NT.115 Instrument Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) enable real-time, immobilization free analysis of biomolecules providing information on the affinity, stoichiometry, enzyme kinetics, and aggregation properties of biomolecules in buffers and complex biological liquids including blood serum and cell lysate. Equipped with the standard sample tray, it can process automatically up to 16 samples per run., 3 models of the Monolith NT.115 instrument are offered, which differ in the excitation/detection spectrum to detect blue, green and/or red fluorescent dyes.  Microscale Thermophoresis can monitor the binding of single ions (40Da) or small molecules (300Da) to a target as well as the binding of ribosomes (2.5MDa).  This instrument is also easy to handle and allows to measure the binding of biomolecules as well as the activity of enzymes.  

Microscale Thermophoresis monitors binding and biochemical activity of biomolecules under close-to-native conditions:

  immobilization-free; 
  In a solution of choice, ranging from standard and proprietary buffers to complex bioliquids including blood serum or cell lysates; and,
  at a temperature of choice. 
 
The capillary format is easy to handle and offers maximum flexibility in the experiment scale. The sample tray format allows to process automatically up to 16 capillaries (e.g. for a detailed KD-analysis), or alternatively to perform smaller pilot experiments or end point measurements involving 2-3 capillaries only. Microscale Thermophoresis requires approximately 100fold less sample material compared to standard technologies. Capillary volume: 3-5 l. 1-100 nM of the labeled compound.  The Monolith NT.115 instrument is supported by a software for data acquisition and analysis.

Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) technology uses a fluorescence microscope equipped with a dichroic mirror that couples a IR-Laser into the path of fluorescence light. The heating laser is focused with the same objective used for fluorescence detection. This enables a precise local heating (1-6 K) of the glass capillary and simultaneously to observe and measure local changes of fluorescence intensity due to the motion of labeled molecules in the glass capillaries. Fluorescently labeled molecules or particles are initially distributed evenly and diffuse freely in solution. By switching on the IR-Laser, the molecules experience a thermophoretic force in the temperature gradient and typically move out of the heated spot. In the steady state, this molecule flow is counterbalanced by ordinary mass diffusion. After turning off the laser, the particles diffuse back towards a homogeneous distribution. The following stages are recorded for each sample: fluorescence signal before turning the IR laser on, fast temperature-dependent changes in fluorescence intensity of the analyzed molecules, thermophoresis and back diffusion after switching the laser off.

Interested parties should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above and in the attached draft statement of work. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Statements should also include an indication of current certified small business status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement (preferably placed under the eligible small business concerns name and address).  Responses will be reviewed only by NIH personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.

All capability Statements sent in response to this SOURCES SOUGHT notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Dorothy Maxwell, Contract Specialist, at maxwelld@mail.nih.gov in either MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), by February 8, 2011, 12:00 PM, EST. All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered.

<DESC><p>NOTICE: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. The information provided in response to this notice will assist the Government in identifying sources that are capable of furnishing the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) with the requirements below.</p>
<p>NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, Southwest Fisheries Science Center has a requirement to:</p>
<p>1. Collect vessel-level economic cost and returns data for individual Class 5 and Class 6 tuna purse seine vessels for the calendar years 2009 and 2010.</p>
<p>2. Collect vessel-level bycatch data, to the extent it exists, for calendar years 2009 and 2010 at a trip-level of detail from purse seine vessel unloading data, where bycatch includes small individuals on the target species, such as yellowfin, skipjack, and bigeye, as well other species of fish, marine mammals, sea turtles, sea birds, and other marine organisms.</p>
<p>A Firm Fixed Price contract is contemplated which will cover costs for Labor, Travel and the provision of all deliverables. Government personnel will be responsible for the overall scheduling of project activity and will provide the contractor's liaison/project manager, as appropriate, scheduling information.</p>
<p><br />Background</p>
<p>1. Capacity and Rights-Based Management: Economic Data Needs</p>
<p>The world's tuna fisheries are at a critical juncture, with most tuna stocks fully exploited and some overexploited, and all of them face growing fishing pressures from high demand, overcapacity, and the ongoing march of technology. The conservation and management of these tuna stocks are complicated by the transnational nature of these and other highly migratory species, so that the stocks are shared among nations' Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), but also extend to the high seas beyond these EEZs. Highly mobile fleets of vessels of multiple gear types from many nations harvest these tunas in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans and adjacent seas, creating problems of coordination, cooperation, and transboundary externalities. The transnational nature of the tunas and fishing fleets creates conservation and management issues of jurisdiction, property rights, international law, and multilateral cooperation. Limited entry into tuna fisheries, and, in general, an even greater strengthening of property rights, coupled with multilateral cooperation, are required to prevent the inevitable outcome of overexploitation of the world's tuna stocks, further overcapacity, and declining profitability and general socioeconomic benefits.</p>
<p>Available fishing capacity is far greater than necessary to harvest the tuna stocks at levels corresponding to the Maximum Sustainable Yield and well beyond that for Maximum Economic Yield. This overcapacity is currently causing overfishing of some stocks and tunas and economic inefficiencies and unless controlled, poses a serious threat to the health of many of the world's tuna stocks as well as causing erosion of economic benefits, waste of capital, and heightened conflict among states over a fixed or steadily declining resource base.</p>
<p>Urgent action is required to forestall this slide in the ecological and economic health. The time is ripe to address these problems and their root causes, especially free entry into the fisheries, weak or absent harvest rights, allocation of fishing and property rights, and inadequacies in international law, institutions, and treaties. A shift is needed to realign the incentives of tuna fleets away from the race to fish and its consequences, to incentives that favor sustainable target catches and resource stocks, conserving the ecosystem and limiting the ecological cost of fishing, and increasing the economic surplus. In this way, the actions of individuals and groups more closely align with the interests of society and common resource externalities are reduced or eliminated.</p>
<p>The first step towards controlling capacity is to establish limited entry after which reductions in vessel numbers can be negotiated. Technological advances need to be taken into account to avoid effort creep. Buybacks are a potential second step to voluntarily reduce excessive capacity and can be an important catalyst to rights-based management. The third step entails establishing exclusive rights to fish. A system of rights can be an exclusive use or a property right. Similar systems could be used for fulfilling obligations such as bycatch limits. Such rights-based management is an effective way to address overcapacity, over-exploitation, conservation, create sustainable economic and social benefits, and employment.</p>
<p>Economic research is required in the process addressing overcapacity and when establishing rights-based management, including the potential use of vessel buybacks. Measures of the net economic benefits, such as through a cost-benefit analysis and bioeconomic model, are required to point the way and convince fishers and Regional Fishery Management Organizations (RFMOs) of the economic gains, as well as to clarify potential fleet restructurings. Economic research is also ideally an integral part of clarifying and establishing design elements of vessel buybacks and various forms of rights-based management.</p>
<p>Economic research that is credible and convincing cannot proceed without sound economic data, particularly vessel-level data on the financial and economic costs of harvesting, catches and revenues, and measures of economic input usage. Such data are patchy and are decidedly incomplete. Hence, one purpose of this contract is to collect vessel-level economic and vessel data for tropical purse seine vessels, as detailed in Tasks 1 and 2 below.</p>
<p><br />2. Bycatch</p>
<p>Bycatch is becoming increasingly important for the management of tropical tuna fisheries, and forms a second critical issue. Bycatch includes small target tunas, non-target species of fish, marine mammals, sea birds, sea turtles, and other marine animals taken during fishing tunas. Many bycatch species are discarded at sea, where many of these species die, creating a waste. Particular concerns arise when the bycatch is a long-lived species with low reproductive rates, particularly if the species is threatened or endangered. Bycatch of particular species may have impacts on the ecosystem and biodiversity, such as removal of top-level predators or of prey. Bycatch has negative impacts on fishers as well. Bycatch can be a source of conflict, creates a bad image with consumers, leads to restrictive regulations, and can decrease profit because of the time that must be spent separating the bycatch from the fish to be retained. Moreover, if bycatch is mainly small tunas of the target species, it can lead to a decline in the resource of interest. Objectives of bycatch management, therefore, can be diverse: avoiding severe depletion of a species, retaining the basic structure and functioning of ecosystems, reducing waste in fisheries, reducing interactions between fisheries, keeping fisheries open, and rebuilding depleted populations.</p>
<p>Reduction of bycatch is likely to be enacted through a combination of measures, since no single measure is likely to reduce bycatch to the amount desired or at a reasonable cost. Bycatch reduction is likely to focus on fish caught in association with floating objects, particularly drifting floating aggregation devices (FADs), and on impacts on endangered species (e.g. sea turtles and seabirds).</p>
<p>Technology standards - gear, handling, and operations - are likely to form the centerpiece of any suite of measures adopted, much as they did for dolphin conservation or shallow sets of pelagic longlines for swordfish. Technology standards can be particularly useful in transnational fisheries requiring multilateral actions, since more informal coordinated activities among nations can be implemented far more easily and quickly than more formal cooperative agreements, such as treaties. Compliance is also easier to obtain and to verify.</p>
<p>Description of Work and Services:</p>
<p>Task 1. Collect vessel-level economic cost and returns data for individual Class 5 and Class 6 tuna purse seine vessels for the calendar year 2009 and 2010.

<DESC>This is not an announcement of a Solicitation.  The U.S. Geological Survey needs to assess industry interest and capability to provide environmental time-series-data software and software support services.In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, Request for Information for Solicitation and Planning Purposes (October 1997), this notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Department of the Interior (DOI)/U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) intends to assess the responses to inform its decision-making. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to contract for services. The government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this notice and will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with RFI submission. Responses to this RFI will not affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any RFP that might follow. Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such and the government will ensure this information is not released externally. The overarching objective for this RFI is information gathering and not acquisition of products or services.Part of the mission of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is to provide hydrologic information that contributes to the wise management of the Nation's natural resources and that promotes the health, safety, and well-being of the people. This information consists of databases and descriptions and analyses of the water resources of the United States. Much of the streamflow, groundwater, and water-quality data collected by the Water Mission Area of the USGS are time-series data measured at a frequency of as much as 12 times per hour. The USGS currently stores and processes its time-series water data in an internally developed and maintained system. Recent evaluations of the efficiencies of our time-series data processes have identified our greatest need to be a modern, powerful set of software tools to increase the efficiency of our time-series data collection, processing, review, and dissemination. The immediacy and scope of this need requires that we look beyond our normal software development process.Consequently, we are performing market research on a data-processing system that supports these needs for our surface-water, groundwater, and water-quality time-series data. For this, we are issuing a general request for information to vendors of time-series water-data processing software. The ideal software system should include the following features and characteristics:
A.	Software System functionality	Allows for full support of any type of time-series data and meta-data (e.g. groundwater, surface water, water quality, atmospheric).	Includes an intuitive graphical user interface 	Not tied to a specific data model/database but adaptable to read other data and meta-data structures.	Allows for different user-level privileges to maintain access to data editing, data approval, and site and database administrative functions.	Provides the ability to ingest historical data from legacy systems	Functions under the most recent versions of Windows (7, XP, 2003, Vista, etc ).	Allow for implementation on a portable PC and its operation in standalone mode in the field.	Used in a network environment where data is replicated over multiple nodes	Allows for integration of external, user written, scripts or modules for data processing or display.B.	Data acquisition	Includes system for time-series data acquisition using GOES satellite, modem, and other telemetry systems. 	Allows for manual uploading of time-series logger files.	Includes ability to manually and automatically process files containing discrete measurements, site inspections, calibrations, and other site visit data.	Supports loading and use of site metadata information such as surveying data, cross-sections, photos, etc.	Includes the capacity to apply automated QA/QC procedures to screen and flag real-time data, to monitor site and sensor conditions, and to issue automated reporting/alerts.C.	Data processing	Includes the ability to display and manage site visit data (discrete measurements, inspections, calibrations, etc.)	Includes a computation module to generate discharge and other parameters both manually and automatically, applying relevant data corrections, ratings, and shifts.	Includes a module to develop other user-selected models for the computation of parameters from one or more time-series data sets and a computation module to apply those models both manually and automatically. 	Includes a module for the graphic creation and maintenance of stage-discharge ratings and rating shifts.	Includes a module for the graphical development of data corrections for sensor fouling, sensor drift or other corrections that integrates time series and site visit data.	Includes a module for graphical and tabular editing of time-series data and daily summary statistics (e.g. daily mean values)	Includes the ability to automatically compute and apply data corrections and rating shifts based on entered site visit data.	Includes methods to develop regression models and to estimate missing time-series data from regression equations or other means.	Includes the ability to automatically apply data grades or uncertainty to time-series data.	Stores an audit trail of data editing, corrections and processing steps.	Includes the ability to store comments related to all processing steps (edits, corrections, rating application, estimates, etc.) and to compile those comments into a site analysis history.	Includes the ability to generate daily, monthly, and annual statistics	Includes the ability to analyze time-series data for peak events and other period of record extremes.D.	Data review	Maintains levels of data processing to track the status of the time-series data review up to data approval.	Includes a comprehensive data review module supporting displays and reports of multi-parameter data plots and tables, integrated time-series and site visit data, automated QA/QC checks, and other data review tools.	Includes the ability to track revisions to approved dataE.	Output and dissemination	Includes module to manage the dissemination of data to the web. Provides alerts when data acquisition or dissemination processes fail.	Ability to output data in various formats (graphical, tabular, and flat file) in manual and batch processeso	Instantaneous datao	Daily statisticso	Processing instructions (corrections, models, ratings, shifts)o	Site visit data

<SUBJECT>List of approved fruit fly lure manufacturers
<SOLNBR>Approved_Fruit_Fly_Lure_Manufacturers
<CONTACT>Nathan Johnson, Email nathan.d.johnson@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>The NFFTC (National Fruit Fly Trapping Committee) evaluated the testing results of the two and three component fruit fly lures submitted in response to requests for information issued in 2010.<br /><br />Based on trap captures the Suterra 2 individual paks, Scentry 2C cone, and Ag Bio 2C packet are all acceptable for program use.
<p>Based on trap captures the Sutera 3 individual paks, Sutera 3-in-1 unipak, Scentry 3C cone, and Ag Bio 3C packet are all acceptable for program use.</p>
<p>Based on operational testing and the ease of use the NFFTC is recommending the use of a cone presentation for use as the standard lures for Anastrepha spp. and medfly, respectively, in detection programs. However this recommendation does not preclude the use of packet lures (or other format) as an acceptable alternative.</p>
<p>1.0 Approved Products List</p>
<p>Companies that want to get their products on the approved manufacturers list will have to submit approximately 200 samples at NO COST to the Government for a field test and bioassay. Testing will occur on an annual or as needed basis.</p>
<p>2.0 Lure Formulation and Design</p>
<p>The 2-component lures consist of ammonium acetate and putrescine.</p>
<p>The 3-component lures consist of ammonium acetate, trimethylamine, and putrescine.</p>
<p>The dispensers are utilized in various Fruit Fly Trapping programs. Dispensers should be constructed in a fashion that is conducive to outside conditions. The dispensers should not leak liquids, deteriorate in the sunlight, or dissolve in wet or damp conditions.</p>
<p>The product must be easily opened by hand. Dispensers shall be compatible to use with the Better World Manufacturing Inc. Multi-Lure trap and shall be able to fit snugly into the lure well on top of the trap or hang from the central clip at the top of the trap.</p>
<p>Other than the above information there is no required design (presentation) for the lure</p>
<p>3.0 Evaluation of Field Bio Assay</p>
<p>The lures effectiveness in attracting Mexican fruit flies (Anastrepha ludens) will be evaluated at: 1 day, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks against a Mcphail Trap freshly baited with Torula yeast pellets.</p>
<p>Any lure that does not meet the minimum standard below would not be considered acceptable for program needs.</p>
<p>Less than 50% capture after 24 hours - unacceptable<br />Greater than or equal to 50% capture after 6 weeks - satisfactory<br />Less than 50% capture after 6 weeks -- unacceptable<br />Greater than or equal to 50% capture after 8 week -- Excellent</p>
<p>4.0 Evaluation of Operational Test</p>
<p>The samples will be placed in traps in the field to see how the lure products withstand Texas's weather conditions. The process will be run simultaneously with the Bioassay test. The handling procedures are important to prevent the loss of lure and to eliminate lure contamination of the trap. The product must be easily opened by hand. Dispensers shall be compatible with use with the Better World Manufacturing Inc Multi-Lure trap and shall be able to fit snugly into the lure well on top of the trap or hang from the central clip at the top of the trap.</p>
<p>Problems observed in previous operational field tests include lure precuts melting, difficulty removing the lure from the trap bait well, and lures falling from the central clip.<br /><br />5.0 Completion of Testing</p>
<p>At the end of the testing a report will be given to all companies who submitted samples detailing the results for their product.</p>
<p>4.0 Submission Information</p>
<p>Companies desiring to have their product tested must submit the following information</p>
<p>Company name<br />DUNS<br />Point of contact<br />Name<br />Phone<br />Email<br />Mailing address</p>
<p>The information will be kept on file and the company will be contacted when the next testing cycle begins. Submit all information via email to:</p>

<DESC><p>This is only a Request for Information (RFI), not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and all information received will be for planning purposes only. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) does not intend to award a contract on the basis of your responses or otherwise pay for the preparation of any information presented or the use of any such information. All proprietary information should be marked as such.</p>
<p>This Market Research/RFI is being issued to gather information and seek available sources to research and author a book on the history of FLETC from 1996 -2010. FLETC is an organization dedicated to training personnel from some 88 federal law-enforcement agencies. In addition, it provides training to personnel from state, local, tribal and international agencies, and to those from federal agencies not immediately tasked with law enforcement duties. FLETC locations include its headquarters at Glynco, Georgia, and facilities in Artesia, New Mexico, Charleston, South Carolina, and Cheltenham, Maryland. Founded in 1970, FLETC is today part of the Department of Homeland Security. The history would be used in new employee orientation, new supervisor training program, and various leadership programs to establish the foundation of training at FLETC and building esprit de corps w/the staff. The FLETC history is important to evaluate who we are and where we've been, so we can set the appropriate direction for the future. <br /><br />Interested sources must document the process involved, e.g., research, interviewing, drafting/editing and final delivery (printing is not included). FLETC anticipates face-to-face interviews with previous Directors (two in the Washington, DC, area and one in the Brunswick, GA, area) as well as the current Director at FLETC Glynco. In addition, former senior staff, key Congressional staffers, and others affiliated with the FLETC may be identified and interviewed by telephone or video conference. Additional travel may include travel to each FLETC site. <br /><br />FLETC history prior to 1996 was documented in <em>The Trainers: The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center and the Professionalization of Federal Law Enforcement</em>, Published 1996, Calhoun, Frederick S. The themes established and chapter format developed for the aforementioned book are highly desirable. (Re: Attachment)<br /><br />Interested sources must provide a detailed description of the process, estimated time to complete, potential cost, and any past performance history for same or similar service. Potential sources should respond in writing. Technical questions must be submitted in writing. The response must include documentation that demonstrates a capability to perform. Responses to this RFI/Market Survey should be submitted as follows: by e-mail to terry.mckain@dhs.gov. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. The deadline for any responses to this notice is close of business on February 22, 2011.</p>

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to extend the term of the Total Information Processing Support Services  3 (TIPSS-3) Program which provides sources for Information Technology (IT) processing support services to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Department of the Treasury, and its Bureaus.  The TIPSS-3 program consists of 21 Indefinite-delivery-indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts that provide services in three principal task areas:  Information System Services, Strategic Business Services and System Security Services.  The support encompasses a large spectrum of services from microcomputer applications to large scale integrated systems.  Services are required across virtually all software languages and hardware platforms.  Task Orders may be cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF), cost-plus-incentive-fee (CPIF), cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF), firm-fixed-price (FFP), fixed-price-incentive-fee (FPIF), fixed-price-award-fee (FPAF), labor-hour (LH), and time-and-materials (T&M), and/or performance based.  All TIPSS-3 contractors that have Task Orders for any activity related to software development must comply with the IRS policy for Capability Maturity Model IntegrationSM CMMI compliance.

The TIPSS-3 program includes the following contract numbers and companies: 
TIRNO-06-D-00006 with Accenture LLP
TIRNO-06-D-00011 with ActioNet, Inc.
TIRNO-06-D-00028 with Apogen Technologies

TIRNO-06-D-00009 with Deloitte Consulting LLP (formally Bearing Point)

TIRNO-06-D-00021 with Pragmatics, Inc.

TIRNO-06-D-00008 with HP Enterprise Services, LLP (formally Electronic Data Systems Corporation)
TIRNO-06-D-00012 with General Dynamics Information Technology, Inc. (formally FC Business Systems)

The Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has a mission critical need for the broad range of IT-related services that are currently being fulfilled by the TIPSS-3 contracts.  There is a continuing critical need for these services.  Failure to continue these contracts could adversely affect IRS operations.  The aforementioned services are critical to keeping the IRS, the Department of the Treasury, and its Bureaus information processing systems operational to support the many important tax administration and other modernization projects that are on-going such as the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC), the Automated Collection System (ACS) Support, and the Treasury Homeland Security Presidential Directive  12 (HSPD-12) Program Management Support for Implementation of Federal Information Processing Standards 201-1 (FIPS 201-1) Part 2: PIV II.  The Government intends to award modifications to the TIPSS-3 contracts to add a one-year extension.  The one-year extension will allow for a smooth transition to the TIPSS-4 contracts.  The TIPSS-3 contracts will expire on April 27, 2011.  The one-year extension would be from April 28, 2011 through April 27, 2012.  The extension would ensure the continuation of mission critical programs while the TIPSS-4 acquisition is going through the final phase of the competitive process and would ensure the maximum competitive process for task order awards is utilized on continuing IT requirements during the transition from TIPSS-3 to TIPSS-4.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This is not a solicitation for proposals or an invitation for bids.  The Government does not anticipate receiving responses to this notice of a non-competitive action.  If parties choose to respond, any cost associated with preparation and submission of data or any other cost incurred in response to this announcement are the sole responsibility of the respondent and will not be reimbursed by the Government.

<DESC>Notice Type: <br />Notice of Intent - Sole Source
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Office of Information Systems Management (OISM), intends to negotiate with Hitachi ID Systems, Inc.; Canada, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to provide the maintenance renewal described below.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The NIST OISM has adopted a password policy that all users and system administrators must follow under a directive from the U.S. Department of Commerce. OISM purchased the software P-Synch from M-Tech Technologies (now called Hitachi ID Systems) in 2002 in order to implement this policy. NIST currently has 7000 user licenses for Hitachi-ID Password Manager and requires support/maintenance of the existing licenses.</p>
<p>NIST intends to procure annual support and maintenance of the Hitachi-ID Password Manager. The Hitachi Password Manager ties into other existing systems being used at NIST and there will be compatibility issues with several of these existing systems if a software other than Password Manager is purchased. Therefore, it is not in the best interest of the Government to purchase new software as opposed to renewing maintenance for the current software. Recent market research shows that Hitachi ID Systems is the only vendor authorized to provide the required maintenance renewal.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 511210. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Hitachi ID Systems for this requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST to provide these services may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before February 14, 2011 at 4 pm EST. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Divya Soni at divya.soni@nist.gov.</p>

DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK                        INTRODUCTION
The U.S. Clean Air Act requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to carry out periodic reviews of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for major "criteria" air pollutants and to revise the NAAQS for a given pollutant, as appropriate.  As part of these reviews, the National Center for Environmental Assessment - RTP Division (NCEA-RTP) within EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) assesses the newly available scientific information in Integrated Science Assessment (ISA) documents (formerly known as Criteria Documents) that provide the scientific basis for the reviews of the NAAQS for particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and lead (Pb).
One of the major criteria pollutants affecting vegetation and ecosystems in the U.S. is O3.  Information on how, where and at what levels O3 is affecting vegetation is critical to NCEA?s ISA?s. Scientific information on O3 effects in National Parks and other protected natural areas is especially useful for informing the review of the secondary O3 standard.   
For the past several years the National Park Service has been surveying for O3-induced diagnostic visible foliar injury within the National Parks.  Diagnostic foliar injury has been found in cut-leaf coneflower in the National Parks in the eastern U.S. for many years.  Recently, visible injury has been found in populations of cut-leaf coneflower in riparian areas in the Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP).  However, laboratory experiments are needed to confirm that the injury found in RMNP is a result of O3 exposure.
The work in this project is designed to use O3 exposure chambers to look at leaf damage to cut-leaf cone-flower populations from eastern and western National Parks.  This work will confirm whether or not the injury observed in RMNP is from O3 pollution.  This knowledge is critical for understanding extent of O3 effects in protected areas in the western U.S., what species are sensitive to O3 in the western U.S. and what locations researchers should look for O3-induced visible leaf injury.  This project will also build upon a long foundation of knowledge obtained from the surveying program at the National Park Service and provides a critical step to make the surveys more relevant to the scientific review of the secondary O3-NAAQS. TASKS
The Contractor shall accomplish the following tasks and shall complete these tasks according to the estimated deliverable schedule below.
Task 1.  Submit a Joint Quality Management / Quality Assurance Project Plan
The Contractor shall submit to the EPA Project Officer a Joint Quality Management(JQM) / Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) that describes how the quality of all data, bothprimary and secondary, will be managed and assessed. The JQM/QAPP must be submittedwithin 20 days of award of the contract and must be approved before any work begins.
Task 2.  Conduct Literature Review
The Contractor shall use available search engines and other appropriate literature search strategies to locate relevant publications that will provide information relevant to O3-induced diagnostic foliar injury. Particular focus should be made on the cut-leaf coneflower species, characteristics of O3 injury, and statistical data analytic approaches.
Task 3.  Purchase and collect materials and set up experiment
The Contractor shall purchase all materials to prepare exposure systems for the experiment, grow and maintain plants and other relevant material.  The Contractor shall also collect plant material from the relevant field locations.  The contract shall perform the necessary work to have exposure systems ready for the experiment.
Task 4.  Conduct initial exposure tests, prepare preliminary report 
The Contractor shall conduct initial exposure tests for an initial time period determined with guidance from the of the technical project officer.  The Contractor shall prepare a preliminary report on the performance of the exposure system.  
Task 5.  Conduct full exposure experiments, maintain plants and collect data 
The Contractor shall conduct the exposure experiment for two seasons and maintain the plants throughout the experiment.  Hourly O3 data shall be collected and sent to the technical project officer.  
Task 6.  Analyze Data 
The Contractor shall provide figures, tables and data analyses to the EPA Technical Project Officer.  
Task 7.  Prepare Final Report
The Contractor shall prepare a final report which will consist of (1) literature review; (2)material and methods; (3) results; (4) discussion; (5) conclusions; (6) references. 
Task 8.  Participation in Conference Calls and Face-to-Face Meetings
At times it may be necessary to discuss progress and data analysis approaches with theEPA Technical Project Officer. It is estimated that about six conference calls may be necessary for these discussions. Each call is expected to be one hour in duration. The Contractor will be notified at least two weeks in advance of a conference call.  Some meetings may be needed face-face at the site of the experiments or at the EPA RTP facilities. These meetings will be on an as-needed basis  
DELIVERABLES AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES
                    The Contractor shall provide all intermediate and final data sets and programming code to the EPA Technical Project Officer for all data products specified in the above tasks.

<DESC>Notice of intent to issue a sole source modification under Contract No. 277-04-6091. Contractor: IQ Solutions, Inc., 11300 Rockville Pike, Suite, 901, Rockville, MD 20852. The purpose of this contract modification is to provide continued Agency-wide information dissemination/health communication services for an additional 4-month period. These services directly support the Agency's Public Awareness & Support strategic initiative, and include the following services/operations: 24-hour Contact Center; online store to download/order Agency publications; Warehouse/order fulfillment center; E-mail update marketing communications; and Public awareness outreach activities.  

Demonstration of Proposed Contractors Unique Qualifications: The successful dissemination of an Agency's knowledge requires a contractor with specific knowledge and experience combining sound public health practices with science-based communications and marketing approaches, as well as in-depth expertise on SAMHSA's project and program portfolio.  IQ Solutions, Inc., the current contractor, is uniquely qualified to provide these services because they have specialized expertise in the communication of behavioral health information; significant expertise in reaching SAMHSA's key audiences - including behavioral health professionals, social services providers, educators, state and federal policymakers, health care providers, and military services members/families/veterans, and consumers through multiple communications channels; and they currently serve SAMHSA as the key contractor on all major information dissemination/health communication activities, including running the Agency's contact center and fulfillment/distribution center - which handles over 600,000 calls and maintains over 1,000 titles of the latest publications - and disseminating over 13,000,000 products annually.  The above factors combine to demonstrate IQ Solutions' uniqute insight and experience level with the relevant subject matter to perform the task within the relatively short time period required.  The staff expertise available through this contractor will enable SAMHSA to start the project immediately, conduct it in the most efficient manner, and bring it to conclusion within the required time frame.  

Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: At this time, IQ Solutions is the only contractor that will be able to provide the services in the required time frame.  Award to another contractor for these short-term services would be time and cost prohibitive and represent a duplication of efforts.

This proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1))  Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capabilities received within 45 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Responses are due no later than MARCH 21, 2011, 3:00 PM local time. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contractor based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SOLNBR>FDA1083907
<RESPDATE>021111
<CONTACT>Emily Hunt, Email emily.hunt@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>This synopsis, NAICS code 541690, identified as FDA1083907, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following specifications, under the simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. Hard copies will only be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act upon request.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary.</p>
<p>1. Statement of Need <br />The intent is to purchase training from a qualified vendor on &lsquo;Overview of Chemometrics'. With the increase in adoption of the QbD paradigm for drug development by the pharmaceutical industry, more and more new drug applications are being submitted that have employed Chemometric techniques to implement PAT (Process Analytical Technology) based methods. Typically PAT based techniques are used for process monitoring and control. The objective of this training is to provide a background on Chemometrics to ONDQA, which is imperative for the review staff to perform a thorough science and risk based evaluation of regulatory submissions containing Chemometric based models.</p>
<p>2. Statement of Work (SOW)<br />The composite course should be designed to provide the student with a basic understanding of the theoretical basis of Chemometrics, with appropriate computer based hands-on experience using any Matlab based software or equivalent. In addition, when applicable, the course should also include appropriate examples of implementation of Chemometrics in the pharmaceutical industry. The student is identified as an FDA review chemist with a need to obtain greater insights into Chemometrics.</p>
<p>The required format of the course spanning over four days, is as follows:</p>
<p>(a) A half day course that gives a primer on Linear Algebra and software familiarity. Linear algebra is regarded as the backbone of all Chemometric models. This half day course would give a background on linear algebra that is required to understand common Chemometric techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS). Since chemometric models are computationally intensive, the first day course should include a review of Matlab or equivalent software, and use relevant examples.</p>
<p>(b) A full day course on PCA. This course would provide an in depth look at the basics of PCA and interpretation of PCA based models. This full day course would include hands-on computer time for the students to work on developing PCA based models. An example of software that may be used for hands-on training is Matlab based PLS Toolbox.</p>
<p>(c) A full day course on PLS. This course would cover all basic regression techniques that include: Classical Least Squares (CLS), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Principal Components Regression (PCR) and PLS regression. This full day course would also include some computer hands-on time using software such as PLS Toolbox.</p>
<p>(d) A half day course on &lsquo;Common Mistakes in Implementing Chemometrics for PAT '. Implementation of Chemometrics for PAT poses some unique challenges e.g. logistics associated with model deployment and maintenance. This half day course would familiarize the students with various Chemometric tools that can be effectively used for various PAT applications as well as discuss some common pitfalls/watch outs. This half day course would not necessarily involve any hands-on computer time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deliverables<br />The contractor will provide a single offering of 24 hours of training on &lsquo;Overview of Chemometrics' over 4 days; to our staff (maximum 20 attendees for the half day primer on Linear Algebra as well as the two full day courses on PCA and PLS and a maximum of 40 attendees for the last half day course on &lsquo;Common Mistakes in Implementing Chemometrics for PAT') on site at FDA or very close to FDA campus in Maryland. Deliver presentation materials, handouts, binders for 20 and at least 10 demo versions of the software (assuming 2 students per computer) that will be used for the hands-on training. The demo version of the software will be available prior to the training and be loaded onto available computers in the training room. Scheduling may prohibit execution of the entire course over a consecutive 4 day span, which will require multiple trips by the provider.</p>
<p>Period of Performance/Basis <br />September 20-23, 2011 (Funded with FY11 funds)<br />June 5-8, 2012 (FY 12 option)<br />June 4-7, 2013 (FY 13 option)</p>
<p>Place of Performance<br />The training shall be delivered in the DC Metro Area.</p>
<p><br />Award will be made to the party whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered. The Government may award this contract to other than the lowest price technically acceptable quote. Technical Capability is significantly more important than price.</p>
<p><br />FAR provisions can be found on the following website: http://www.arnet.gov.</p>
<p>The following provisions apply to this acquisition:</p>
<p><br />FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items;</p>

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are more important than cost or price. As offerors' rating for non-price factors approach equivalency, price becomes more important in the award decision. As pricing approaches equivalency, the non-price factors becomes more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2, EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>Evaluation of Proposals <br />Proposals received in response to the solicitation will be evaluated based on best value to Government. Specifically, the best value approach permits the Government to select the most advantageous offer based on price factors and non-price factors.<br />The proposals will be evaluated on the following factors:</p>
<p>Technical Approach - The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the requirement and overall scope of work required, and the Offeror's approach to delivery of the training.</p>
<p>Instructor Qualifications and Experience - The Government will evaluate the relevancy of the work experience of the instructor(s) to the scope of work to be performed and the environment in which instruction has been provided (i.e Federal and/or scientific). The Government will evaluate the instructor's experience in providing same or similar training as defined in the Statement of Work (SOW).</p>

Offerors shall ensure that SF 330s are mailed or sent by courier in a timely manner to be delivered to the NAVFAC Southwest facility no later than the date and time stated in this notice.

  Offerors intending to deliver the SF 330 in person to the facility at the address above are cautioned that this NAVFAC Southwest facility is located in downtown San Diego.

No parking or offloading of SF 330s is available at the Government facility.  SF 330s are to be delivered to the mailroom in Building 128 and reasonable time shall be allowed for the person in the mailroom to receive and time stamp the SF 330.  The stamp time is determined from the NAVFAC Southwest facility mailroom time stamp and not any other time keeping equipment that the Offeror may own.

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)</p>
<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

Fort McHenry NMHSNational Park Service2400 East Fort AvenueBaltimore, MD 21230410-962-4290
February 2011
INTERPRETIVE FIREWORKS PROGRAM
BACKGROUNDA Dedication Ceremony for the new Fort McHenry National Monument and Shrine Visitor and Education Center is being held on March 3, 2011 to recognize the 80th anniversary of the designation of "The Star-Spangled Banner" as the official National Anthem of the United States. The fireworks display during this event is intrinsically tied to the interpretive program of the evening, representing a symbolic ship-to-shore bombardment, more specifically, a demonstration of "the bombs bursting in air, the rockets red glare," that occurred in 1814 and which is referenced in the National Anthem. More specifically, the display will invoke the historical context that inspired Francis Scott Key when seeing the American flag still waving over the fort following a twenty-five hour bombardment. As part of the interpretive component of the program, a Congressional Proclamation will be presented sometime during the 6:00-7:00 p.m. hour of the program to reinforce the historical significance of this date in American history.  At 8:00 p.m. the visitors will be invited to step outside the visitor center to view the symbolic bombardment. The symbolic bombardment will last approximately fifteen minutes to allow the visitors to "hear, see, smell and feel the battle conditions," as specified in the Park's long range interpretive plan. 
SCOPE OF WORKContractor will discharge representative pyrotechnics that will be evocative of the look and sound of the bombs and rockets fired by the British in 1814. The Contractor must fire from a barge in the Pataspco River to enable the visitors to understand the historical significance of the attack being launched from the water, since the British fleet was located and Key's truce ship was anchored in water surrounding the Fort.  Artillery (cannons fired by NPS certified black powder artillery dressed as soldiers from 1814) will return fire from the historic Water Battery at Fort McHenry, synchronized to represent the return fire from the fort.  The Ravens Pep Band will play the National Anthem and the 1812 Overture as a replica of the original 30 by 42 foot Star-Spangled Banner is hoisted over the fort to conclude the symbolic bombardment.  The exhibits in the new building and interpretive text in the program highlight how Francis Scott Key was directly influenced by the exploding bombs and rockets to write "The Star-Spangled Banner." 
The interpretive display shall include: 
1)  All pre-production, production, and performance, including all labor, materials, equipment, facilities and travel necessary for the performance of the interpretive display referenced above. The program should last approximately 15 minutes, be commercially reasonable given the circumstances, and provided at the lowest possible cost.  2)  The rental or other provision of a barge for the ignition of fireworks from the Patapsco River, including any cost incidental to providing said barge, its movement to and from the site, and clean-up after the Program. No land based fireworks are contemplated as a part of the demonstration, and the barge is central to the interpretive nature of the event.3) General coordination with music, more specifically, the program will begin when live music begins at approximately 8:00 pm (as directed by NPS personnel) and continue through the playing of music to end after 15 minutes as directed by NPS personnel. The use of pyroditigal techniques is not contemplated. 4) To the extent any is required related to any permits or local laws, overtime or other costs related to the participation of the City Fire Marshal's office. 5)  All transportation and delivery costs. 6) All fireworks will be staged and ignited from a barge located at a specific site in the Patapsco River east of the Park. Contractor will arrange for an adequate barge, movement of such a barge to and from site and cleanup of same after the program.7)  All permit fees, including but not limited those required for the State of Maryland and City of Baltimore. 8)  Contractor will employ only reliable, experienced pyro-technicians to set up the display, safely ignite the show and perform a thorough clean up after the show9)  All lead pyro-technicians must be licensed by the Maryland State Fire Marshal.10)  Required insurance as detailed hereunder.

<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><br />This announcement serves as a Sources Sought synopsis issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. This Sources Sought synopsis is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation nor is this notice a request for quotation. DO NOT submit a quote or proposal in response to this synopsis.
<p>The proposed contract is anticipated to be firm-fixed price (FFP) with a base period of one year and three (3), one-year option periods.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this acquisition, the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330 - Engineering Services, and the applicable size standard is $4.5M.</p>
<p>It is this agency's intention to do an unrestricted acquisition unless enough qualified small businesses (SBs) are located with serious intentions to propose on our requirement allowing for a set-aside. The 50th Contracting Squadron (50 CONS)reserves the right to determine if a SB set-aside is appropriate. Additionally, we reserve the right to determine if one of the targeted socio-economic programs (HUB Zone small business, Small Business Administration (SBA) subcontractors referred to as "8(a)" contractors eligible under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 USC 637(a)), or Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVO) small business is appropriate for a set-aside based on responses to this notice and other pertinent information gathered by the contracting officer. In order for the 50 CONS to make a SB set-aside determination, it is emphasized that SB concerns provide sufficient written information to indicate their capacity and capability to successfully perform and manage all the required services.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to identify companies that are capable and qualified to provide the services required by the DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS), 12 January 2011.</p>
<p>The intent of this requirement is to procure program management, systems engineering and technical support to ensure continuity of effort and provide support to 50th Space Wing Plans and Programs Office (50 SW/XP) planning and programming personnel. Services to be provided by this requirement include, but are not limited to the following: Program management and system engineering support; Wing Compliance and Self-Inspection Program Support; Wing Operational Plan Development; Wing host/tenant base planning and integration to include Wing Operations; Wing Budget Preparation; System Integration of Short-Term Special Projects; Mission sustainment and future program planning; Wing Operational Requirements Development and Coordination. This requirement will provide scientific and engineering technical services to the 50 SW/XP. The 50 SW/XP Office is chartered to provide future planning to support the 50th Space Wing (50 SW) mission and for 50 SW bases and units and acts as the Wing's "front door" providing initial and continuing support to external agencies. The term "front door" means the 50 SW/XP office is the single point of entry, the only source, into the 50 SW for requests for any future planning support requirements. The 50 SW/XP also provides requirements validation, system integration and planning support for Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN), satellite command and control systems and 50 SW users. The contractor shall provide support to all aspects of 50 SW/XP operations.</p>
<p>All responsible, capable, and interested business concerns serious about potentially submitting a proposal to provide these services are invited to respond. The Government requests that responses address the attached questionnaire and PWS. Responses may also include additional feedback that the respondent feels is critical to this procurement. The Government requests that responses be limited to a maximum of 12 pages. Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is voluntary and the Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis. Written responses will not be returned. If you are not interested in supplying this service, no response is necessary.</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program management office (PMO) or contracting officer (CO), but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. The Ombudsman can be reached at Headquarters Air Force Space Command (HQ AFSPC) A7K, 719-554-5250.<br /><br />UPDATE 4 Feb 2011<br />The Government has determined that NAICS code 541330 size standard exception for "Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons" applies to this acquisition. The NAICS code remains 541330 - Engineering Services, however, the size standard has changed from $4.5M to $27M.</p>
<p>The Government is inviting any business concerns who did not respond to this sources sought synopsis because they previously did not qualify, but now qualify under the $27M size standard, to provide a response as requested above. Responses must be received by the Government not later than 4PM MST on 10 February 2011. Companies who have previously responded ARE NOT to resubmit unless the size standard change impacts their capabilities.</p>

<p>The outcomes of this testing may result in a standardized lure design for two component fruit fly attractant.</p>
<p>4.0 Results<br /><br />The NFFTC (National Fruit Fly Trapping Committee) evaluated the testing results of the two component fruit fly lures submitted in response to solicitation AG-6395-S-10-0009. Based on trap captures the Sutera 2 individual paks, Scentry 2C cone, and Ag Bio 2C packet are all acceptable for program use.</p>
<p>Based on operational testing and the ease of use the NFFTC is recommending the use of a cone presentation for use as the standard lures for Anastrepha spp. and medfly, respectively, in detection programs. However this recommendation does not preclude the use of packet lures as an acceptable alternative.</p>

Are all task orders valued over $1M, regardless of previous OEM involvement, to be solicited among all contract awardees?<BR>A2.  Fair opportunity requirements shall be in accordance with applicable statutes, regulations, and case law, including Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6.3 - Other Than Full and Open Competition.<BR><BR>Q3.  Does the Government intend to release a draft version of the full RFP, particularly Section L, Instructions and Section M, Evaluation Criteria?<BR>A3.  The Government does not intend to release a draft version of the full RFP.  No sample tasks will be released prior to the final RFP.  A DRAFT version of Section L, Instructions and Section M, Evaluation Criteria is anticipated to be released on or about 11 February 2011.<BR><BR>Q4. What is the correct date for response for industry comments to the DRAFT PWS?<BR>A4.  The response date for industry's questions and or comments on the GTACS DRAFT PWS is 11 February 2011.  Non-response does not exclude any offeror from participating in the future Request for Proposal (RFP) when it is released.<BR><BR>Q5.

<DESC>This modification is to correct the Notice of Intent to Sole Source for Solicitation W912CM-11-T-0049.  Due to clerical error, the solicitation number was erroneously created as an RFQ. Due to the estimated dollar value of this requirement, creation of an RFP was the appropriate action.  RFQ W912CM-11-T-0049 has been changed to W912CM-11-R-0012.  All conditions of the original intent to sole source still remain and have not changed as a result of this correction.

The solicitation in VIPR will be amended to reflect these changes in a future maintenance cycle:The minimum daily guarantee is applicable to time under hire as defined in D.21.8 below:The time under hire shall start at the time the resource begins traveling to the incident after being ordered by the Government and end at the estimated time of arrival back to the point of hire after being released, except as provided in D.21.8.3.If the transport (associated with a piece of heavy equipment) is released prior to the heavy equipment and the contractor elects to return the transport to their home base, time under hire would end at the estimated time of arrival back to the point of hire, except as stated in D.21.8.1 below:If the contractor elects to keep the transport at the incident location after it is released by the government, no further payment is due.  At the conclusion of the assignment, when the heavy equipment is released, time under hire would begin when the transport begins travel back to the incident.The reference to loaded miles on the Resource Form will be removed at a later time and should be disregarded when quoting prices for the transport(s). Mileage will be paid for round trip mileage; otherwise, the minimum daily guarantee is applicable for all time under hire, whichever is greater.

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.

This modification to RFI N00178-11-Q-3902 is being issued to answer questions that have been submitted.

Clarification Questions 
1.	[8th bullet]: Given that CTP is a pre-defined synchronization mechanism, what does user-defined timing synchronization refer to?
a.	System shall provide the capability for an advanced operator (administrator) to program timing synchronizations (one option of which is the Common Timing Protocol), and apply each to a different threat or threat band within the limitations of the system design.
2.	[12th bullet]: Is the GUI for finding faults and corrective information a depot-level device, or part of the man-portable or mounted system?
a.	The GUI shall provide sufficient information for the operator to be able to execute immediate corrective measures, or to refer to higher-echelon for more advanced correction.
3.	It is noted that the mounted system is allowed to be 90 pounds heavier than the man-portable system.
  What additional capabilities are expected to drive this significant weight difference? It is understood that weight difference would include antennas, amplifiers, and power supplies, but the 90-lb difference is surprisingly high.
a.	The weight allocation is based upon the vehicular load limits, and is not intended to specify a design.  Tactically significant suppression ranges for man-portable and vehicular variants are not identical (see answer to question 13, below).  Note:  The 120lb weight allocation for mounted configuration is exclusive of antennas.
4.	[17th bullet]: What is the nature of the monitoring (of the counter ECM device) that existing EOD robots would be doing?  Is the monitoring done autonomously by the robot, or remotely, by the human operating the robot?
a.	The monitoring shall consist of audible and/or visible alerts as detected by the robot and communicated to a human operator (non-autonomous operation).
5.	[17th bullet]: What are the relevant constraints (balance, weight, clearance, form factor, etc.) for mounting the device on an existing EOD robot?
a.	Planned concept of operations (CONOPS) requires emplacement of the ECM by EOD robots without requiring persistent presence of the robot.
  Weight is same as man-portable configuration.
6.	[21st bullet]: Can remote control consist of a wired umbilical connection?
a.	Yes.
7.	[23rd bullet]: What is the intended use of the Ethernet and USB interfaces?  Depot maintenance, software download, log upload, failure diagnostics, operational control, etc.?
a.	The Ethernet and USB interfaces shall be used for maintenance/fault diagnosis beyond GUI capability, programming (loadset/software/firmware) upload/download, memory download, and other functions as determined by design.
8.	Are there requirements to include/exclude Anti-Tamper (AT) features?
a.	Any critical program information (CPI) shall be protected by appropriate AT features including items in volatile and non-volatile memory locations.
9.	What are the requirements for performance above/below the horizontal plane?
a.	Need to be able to suppress +/- 6 meters with respect to performance range.
10.	Is there a requirement for continuous performance as the system is being transitioned from its mounted to its dismounted configuration, and vice-versa?
a.	No.
11.	Will there be requirements related to threat density?
a.	Yes.
  Evaluation criteria for threat density will be applied to RFI responses, specific density will not be provided due to sensitivity.
12.	What is the 30 lbs maximum weight constraint based on?  Max. payload of robot? Other?
a.	Maximum dismounted weight is based upon operational limitations.
13.	Will there be a defined minimum/maximum stand-off distance acceptable for the operationally significant distances requirement? 
a.	Yes.  Evaluation criteria for stand-off distances for both vehicular and man-portable variants will be applied to RFI responses, specific distances will not be provided due to sensitivity.
14.	Could you please define RF Threat Spectrum?  i.e.: pass band data.
a.	Any frequencies in which past, current or future RF threats can operate.
  Specific threat bands are sensitive and will not be provided.
15.	Are there constraints on acceptable antenna patterns?  i.e.: to what degree will vertical TX/RX be required? 
a.	The vertical/horizontal pattern constraints are left to the designer to allow for maximum flexibility in achieving performance objectives.
16.	Could you please clarify the Selectable power levels specification request.  i.e.: will different power levels be required for specific pass bands?
a.	The selectable power levels are defined as: high-power to provide maximum protection, or at low power to extend operational time.  The intent of the low power level is to provide ability to operate for longer durations with the understanding that it may result in reduced protection distances.
17.	Could you please clarify the tactically significant timelines specification request, i.e.: what is the constraint of this timing?
a.	This is the time from when the system is turned on until the time that it is fully operational and providing suppression of RF threats.
  The specifics of the timing needs are sensitive and will not be provided.
18.	What is considered acceptable minimal reconfiguration to man-portable ECM system?  
a.	Minimal reconfiguration to man-portable ECM system is defined as any minor changes to the configuration to the man-portable variant which are required to permit transport by EOD robots (e.g. addition of a carrying point/handle which would otherwise not be present in the man-portable configuration).
19.	Please define the provide security of the system to include provisions for both volatile, and non-volatile memory requirement? 
a.	See response 8 above.
20.	Please define the parameters/specifications of the one N connection for RF distribution is the intent to be an interface to an in-building distributed antenna system (DAS)?  Other?
a.	N connector is required to provide RF output from the ECM to system antenna(s)
21.	Could you please define desired audible alerts?
a.	Any alerts (e.g.
 fault, low battery) for which the method of communication is audio-based.  Exact implementation is left to the designer.
22.	What is the expected IOC date & production quantity for the two variant solution systems?
a.	IOC dates and quantities are not defined as of this time, the government has not established that a procurement will occur.
23.	Could you please clarify CONOPS for this ECM system?

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to answer questions posed by perspective contractors. 

Q:Can multiple white papers be submitted by one organization? 

A: Yes, multiple technologies (and associated white papers) from a single organization are acceptable.

Q: Are foreign bidders eligible for consideration? 

THIS REQUEST IS HEREBY EXTENDED TO 28 FEB 2011.

DESCRIPTION: In accordance with FAR 5.205, PEO Submarines is seeking sources that can potentially provide technologies applicable for incorporation into the Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical System (SWFTS) and associated Technology Insertion (TI) efforts under sponsorship of Program Executive Officer Submarines (PMS425). 

The overall end state objective of this SWFTS effort  is to provide improved command decision making performance and reduce the time and cost associated with upgrades to the submarine combat systems elements and attack center.
  SWFTS subsystems typically encompass the following command level functions: mission planning and rehearsal; contact detection, classification and tracking; multi sensor contact management; command team decision making;  post mission reporting;  safe maneuvering of the submarine platform; and effective employment of submarine payloads.

The goal of this sources sought is to identify emerging, new, or modifiable hardware and/or software technologies and concepts that are potentially applicable for near and long term future submarine Command And Control Center (CACC) designs through FY20.  These technologies may include advanced display devices, human computer interaction techniques and computer processing that show promise to improve the command decision team interaction with the systems and also potentially reduce the size, weight, power and cooling demands that the system places on the platform.
  The focus is to identify advanced research and development concepts that are sufficiently mature so that they may be assessed with respect to their ability to meet program objectives. 

Interested vendors shall submit a five-page (maximum) white paper in response to this announcement that describes their technology as it relates to the key functional areas of submarine command and control attack center operations.  Descriptions should include identification of key technologies or algorithms, current state of maturity, results achieved to date and project sponsorship.  

Inquiries, questions and submissions shall be directed to Maria Gregory via email at maria.gregory@navy.mil.  Responses are due no later than 2:00pm on 28 FEB 2011.
  This should not be construed to be a request for proposal or a solicitation of an offer.

This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is undertaking a new program to develop new applications, devices, products, business solutions, and a range of services that improve transportation's role in safety and quality of life. <br /><br />America's transportation system is among the best in the world, but Americans face crash risks, congestion, environmental impacts, and other detriments that erode our quality of life. Smart ideas on how to apply advanced wireless technology can make the transportation system safer, more efficient and even "greener." <br /><br />An advanced open source wireless technology called Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) allows vehicles of all kinds, whether traveling slowly or even over 60 mph, to communicate with each other, stationary roadside equipment, and mobile devices. Thus far, the majority of applications have been aimed toward crash avoidance.<br /><br />The DOT believes that there are new approaches, partnerships and devices for using DSRC that innovators among the broader public can and will devise, if they are called to participate. This is that invitation.<br /><strong><em><br />When vehicles talk to each other, what should they say?<br /></em></strong><br />The Connected Vehicle Technology Challenge (the "Challenge") is soliciting short descriptions of novel, implementable ideas for products or approaches that utilize DSRC to offer benefits to travelers or society at large.<br /><br />Selected prize recipients will receive funded opportunities to present their winning ideas to unleash a new breed of advanced wireless technologies to make universal vehicle connectivity a reality.<br /><br />DSRC technology and this Challenge are described in more detail below.<br /><strong><br />Understanding DSRC<br /></strong><br />DSRC is an open source protocol for wireless communication, similar in some respects to WiFi. While WiFi is used mainly for wireless Local Area Networks, DSRC is intended for highly secure, high-speed wireless communication between vehicles and the infrastructure. The key functional attributes of DSRC are:
<p>&bull; Low latency: The delays involved in opening and closing a connection are very short-on the order of 0.02 seconds.<br /><br />&bull; Limited interference: DSRC is very robust in the face of radio interference. Also, its short range (~1000 m) limits the chance of interference from distant sources. Additionally, DSRC is protected by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for transportation applications. Although purely commercial convenience applications are welcome, transportation safety applications take precedence.<br /><br />&bull; Strong performance during adverse weather conditions.<br /><br />In 2004, the FCC dedicated 75 MHz of bandwidth at 5.9 GHz to be used for vehicle safety and other mobility applications. DSRC operates in this band, and has been developed for over a decade by a range of stakeholders including automakers, electronics manufacturers, state highway departments, and the federal government. Most work on DSRC has focused on active safety-crash avoidance using driver alerts based on sophisticated sensing and vehicle communications. A number of other DSRC applications have been envisioned as well. For example:</p>
<p>&bull; Transit signal priority<br />&bull; Transit vehicle refueling management<br />&bull; Personalized taxi dispatch services<br />&bull; Integrated transportation financial transactions:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- Toll collection<br />&nbsp; -&nbsp;Parking payment<br />&nbsp; - Rental car payments and processing<br /><br />&bull; Enhanced truck roadside inspection<br />&bull; Real time freight logistics<br />&bull; Pedestrian safety at intersections<br />&bull; Routing and scene management for emergency services<br />&bull; Advanced highway-rail and highway-transit grade crossings</p>
<p>More information on DSRC is available at the following website: http://www.its.dot.gov/DSRC/dsrc_faq.htm</p>
<p><strong>This Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Working with our many stakeholders, the DOT aims to improve safety, mobility, and the environmental impacts of transportation. DSRC has the potential to provide dramatic benefits in these goal areas, but only when it is widely implemented in vehicles and roadside equipment. To accelerate DSRC's adoption, the DOT is seeking feasible ideas for valuable new ways to utilize DSRC. This Challenge is seeking all sorts of ideas, from anyone. Winning submissions will be short-20 double-spaced pages or less- and need not be technical. The barriers to entry are intentionally low.</p>
<p>The submissions must describe an idea for a novel use, application, device, product, service or solution that relies on DSRC. The technical, engineering details that would enable the idea do not need to be fully spelled out, although technical feasibility is an important factor in judging the submissions. Similarly, while a full business plan is not a necessary part of a winning submission, the potential for widespread adoption is also an important criterion in judging. Through this challenge, the DOT aims to develop new, actionable ideas, and to connect inventors with potential partners-businesses and investors-that might help bring the ideas to life.</p>
<p><strong>How to Enter</strong></p>
<p>1. Read the Challenge rules and eligibility requirements at the following website: http://connectedvehicle.challenge.gov/rules <br /><br />2. Prepare a description of your idea in no more than 6000 words (about 20 double-spaced pages).<br /><br />3. If desired, prepare a video or images to illustrate your idea.<br /><br />4. By May 1, 2011, submit your material through the Connected Vehicle Technology Challenge website: http://connectedvehicle.challenge.gov. <br /><br />Please Note: Ideas must be submitted through the Connected Vehicle Technology Challenge website. Ideas submitted through the FedBizOpps website will not be accepted.</p> Any questions regarding the Connected Vehicle Technology Challenge must be submitted in writing to the designated Point of Contact, Alison Fecht, at the following email address: Alison.Fecht@dot.gov.  Responses to all questions will be posted on the Blog page of the Connected Vehicle Technology Challenge website: http://connectedvehicle.challenge.gov/posts. <p>
For more details, please visit the Connected Vehicle Technology Challenge website: http://connectedvehicle.challenge.gov. The Connected Vehicle Technology Challenge website contains all of the information needed to respond to this challenge.</p>

<AWARDEE>Fiserv Inc., 4411 E. Jones Bridge Road, Norcross, GA 30092 US
<DESC>U.S. Department of Education (the Department) intends to solicit and negotiate with Fiserv, Inc. on a sole source basis in accordance with the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (b)(2) for renewal of its' Fiserv/Checkfree Recon Plus for Windows software maintenance agreement.  Fiserv, Inc. is the manufacturer of the Checkfree Recon Plus for Windows software and is the only known source which can provide maintenance services for the software.
<p>Contract term will be for three (3) one-year periods commencing on February 28, 2011.  Anticipated value is estimated at $117,000.</p>
<p>Checkfree Recon Plus for Windows software is an automated financial reconciliation tool which provides the Department of Education with critical financial reconciliation functions, such as, Funds Balance With Treasury Reconciliation and Cash Reporting and Reconciliation to the U.S. Department of Treasury. Both of the referenced reconciliation functions are critical parts of the Department's annual financial statement audit process. Since the implementation of Checkfree software, the Department has received seven consecutive clean options on its annual audits. Renewal of the Checkfree Recon Plus for Windows software allows for continuity of these services which are vital to the support of the Department's mission. Due to the volume of financial transactions within the Department, any lapse or interruption in this reconciliation service provided by the Checkfree software is undesirable.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals or notices from interested parties that are received by no later than 5:00 pm (EST) on Monday, February 7, 2011. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.   Government will evaluate any alternative solutions based on overall technical acceptability and total cost of ownership.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing to the attention of Ms. Dega Hussen (Contracting Officer) at dega.hussen@ed.gov.</p>
