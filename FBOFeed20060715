The Government intends to evaluate offerors based on Evaluation Commercial Items with paragraph completed as follows:  N00244M313     EVALUATION OF OFFERS –USING CAPABILITY TO PERFORM AS MINIMUM CRITERIA, PAST PERFORMANCE AND PRICE FACTORS (APR 1996) (FISC SAN DIEGO) (a)  The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.        (i)  CAPABILITY TO PERFORM     (ii)  PAST PERFORMANCE     (ii)  PRICE (b)  Only those Offers which are determined by the contracting officer to be technically capable of performing under Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is significantly less important than Factor (iii), PRICE.   At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   To even be evaluated as technically acceptable/unacceptable, the Offeror must furnish a technical plan and product literature that demonstrates that the offeror can meet all requirements stated in the Statement of Work.  (c) By submitting a signed proposal under this solicitation, Offeror asserts that it is technically capable of performing the specification/ statement of work and all aspects of this contract.  The contracting officer will validate offerors technical capability to perform by verifying that the offeror has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract.  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, offers will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the offer to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award.   (d)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. See the end of this notice for a sample past performance history sheet.  PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.  Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows: NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance. SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance. MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. (e)  Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (f)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. N00244L295     OFFEROR PERFORMANCE DATA (JUN 2000) (FISC SAN DIEGO) #1 The offeror shall demonstrate past performance through completion of the "Contractor Performance Data Sheet".  The Contractor Performance Data Sheet shall be completed in its entirety.  Data other than that requested on the Contractor Performance Data Sheet will not be considered.  Additionally, offerors are urged to submit brief and concise responses, within the confines of the space allotted.  Failure to submit the completed Contractor Performance Data Sheet (along with the proposal) shall be considered certification (by signature on the proposal) that the contractor has no past performance for like or similar items for the Government to evaluate. CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE DATA SHEET NOTE:  THE INFORMATION PROVIDED MAY BE USED TO EVALUATE THE OFFEROR'S PAST PERFORMANCE IN MEETING COSTS/PRICE, TECHNICAL, AND DELIVERY OBJECTIVES.  THE RESULTS MAY BE USED IN THE OVERALL COMPARATIVE EVALUATION OF THE OFFEROR(S) IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION M OF THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. Contractor Name:         RFP # Address:                      POC: (Person who can verify data)                               Telephone: Division:                     FAX: List Performance Data ion your five most recently completed Federal Government contracts (not to exceed three years since completion) for like or similar items under this RFP.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION SPEECH RECOGNITION AND MEDICAL DICTATION/TRANSCRIPTION SERVICES The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking information from potential qualified sources including service disabled veteran owned businesses, small businesses, women-owned business, and small disadvantaged business.  Responses will be used to assist the VHA in developing a Statement of Objectives for the procurement of medical transcription services and the methods for delivering those services to Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) nationwide.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  It is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service.  The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred by the contractor in response to this RFI.  Responses shall not exceed 15 pages, excluding printed marketing brochures, corporate, or product information.  BACKGROUND The VHA is a leader in the development and use of an Electronic Health Record (EHR), which includes both text-based and scanned documents.  Responses should address, at a minimum, transcription capabilities that include report generation, transmission, and uploading of text-based documents compatible with VHA's EHR.  Customarily, the VHA uses traditional dictation and transcription services.  A limited number of VHA facilities utilize a wider range of transcription services, including speech recognition, in an effort to provide timely, accurate, and cost-effective documentation of medical information.   The VHA desires to gain more flexibility by taking advantage of technological solutions that combine software, hardware, and services into a manageable process.  Additionally, the desired solution would include a method for transferring and editing documents prior to incorporating them into a consolidated health record.  VHA provides a full scope of healthcare services that must be supported by this transcription solution.  These services include, but are not limited to, the following areas: radiology, pathology, acute care, outpatient clinic, and emergency room services.  The anticipated initial contract period will be one year with the option of extending the contract period for two additional years at the Government's discretion. STATEMENT OF NEED The VHA has a requirement for medical transcription services that includes: FRONT-END SPEECH RECOGNITION Health care providers will dictate using a speech recognition system and/or device that will transpose speech into text during, or at the completion of the dictation session.  The healthcare provider is responsible for correcting errors in spelling, grammar, composition, and medical terminology, prior to saving and exiting the document. BACK-END SPEECH RECOGNITION Health care providers will speak into a telephone or other digital dictation device (voice capture.)  The speech recognition system produces a draft text copy of the recorded voice file.  Both the draft text file and the synchronized voice file are sent to a transcription editor who is responsible for verifying accuracy, making corrections, and sending the final document or report to the health care provider for review and signature.  The final document will become a part of the medical record. TRADITIONAL DICTATION TRANSCRIPTION SERVICES Health care providers will speak into a telephone or other digital dictation device (voice capture.)  The voice is then transcribed into a text document, which can be uploaded into VHA's EHR. When requested, the contractor shall provide all necessary software, including speech recognition and line counting, as well as components, and hardware for completing dictation and transcription.  All transcription shall be composed in English.  The contractor shall transcribe reports utilizing VHA defined formats, including headers and footers.  The contractor shall transmit and/or upload completed reports and documents to the VAMC using transmission and batch protocols provided by the VHA.  Respondents should include their capabilities for providing any or all of the above solutions.   Medical dictation and transcription services shall be available and/or provided to the VHA on a 24-hour basis, 365 days per year including minimum turn around times (TATs) available for report types.  Responses will be based on a line count of 65 visible (printable) characters, 12 pitch, and spaces between characters and paragraphs do not constitute visible characters.  Respondents will provide their capacity to provide services both in terms of volume and geographic limitations.  The contractor must comply with all national guidelines for security and privacy including the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules, the Privacy Act of 1974, and any additional Department of Veterans Affairs or VHA directives, or requirements for compliance.  QUALIFICATIONS Additional requirements: All work and related work products must be conducted and retained within the United States and its territories.  Contractors must be willing to engage in a business associate relationship and sign, maintain, and comply with a VHA Business Associate Agreement.  Contractors must be willing to engage in a Data Use Agreement, as applicable, which would include specific provisions for transmission, storage, return, and/or destruction of VHA data.  This would also include methods of ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of VHA data.   At the Veterans Health Administration's discretion, facilities must be allowed to participate in monitoring the dictation queue, transfer, upload, and editing of transcribed documents.   Contractors must have the capability and bandwidth to support current high-speed data transmission.  Contractors must provide all necessary software, components, and hardware for completing dictation and transcription and/or have the ability to work with VHA-owned equipment.  Contractors must provide line counts on a monthly basis for validation, and to support billing reports.  Contractors who have previous experience with all of the requirements described above are preferred.  Previous success with interfacing or integration of Veterans Health Information Systems &amp; Technology Architecture (VA-VISTA) is also preferred.  Also, please provide information about any Federal Supply Schedule contracts that your company has that may apply.  REQUESTEED INFORMATION: The VHA requests that all interested parties provide a written response with information on their ability to provide speech recognition, digital dictation, and traditional medical transcription services as described in the Statement of Need.  In addition, responses should include information on the contractor's ability to meet the additional requirements listed under QUALIFICATIONS above. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Are the stated requirements clear and relevant in relation to current information technology concepts and capabilities available in the commercial market? What are your perceptions regarding these requirements as a potential contract or task order? Describe how these services should be structured and strategically sourced. Describe cost savings and other benefits the VHA may receive by implementing change management and acquiring these services. Please describe any relevant lessons learned and industry best practices, to include management, operational approach, security requirements, etc. Are performance measures and incentives effective or beneficial when acquiring the described services?  If so, please identify and describe such measures and incentives. TIME FOR RESPONSE: Responses to this RFI are due 20 business days from the date of issue.  Direct questions to Veronica Bates-Gomez at (202) 254-0436 (primary) or Margaret Milligan at (202) 254-0438 (alternate.).  Please cite VA-101-06-RI-0186.
