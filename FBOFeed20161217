<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>
<p>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>
<p>52.249-1 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT</p>

All contracts will remain active unless or until (1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; (2) contract expiration; (3) task order completion; (4) the capacity is reached; or (5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government. <br />The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months. The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interest of the Government. <br /><br />2. PROJECT INFORMATION: Construction services required include a wide variety of Design-Build and/or Design-Bid-Build (DBB) construction activities, to include, but not limited to: design and construction of roads, parking lots, boat ramps, heli-pads, bridges, gates, retaining walls, drainage improvements, pedestrian border fences, vehicle border fences, airport runways, airport taxiways, levy and flood walls and lighting, irrigation systems, cemetery expansions to include pre-placed crypts, columbaria, ossuaries/memorial walls; and repair or alteration of all of these. Projects will primarily be for Department of Homeland Security but may be used on a limited basis for other customers.</p>
<p>3. EVALUATION INFORMATION: The solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process. In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as "Offerors") may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build and design-bid-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capacity in accordance with the criteria described in Phase 1 solicitation and intends to select up to ten (10) of the Phase 1 Offerors to compete in Phase 2. In addition, the Government reserves the right to select more than ten (10) of the Phase 1 Offerors if, in the opinion of the Source Selection Authority, consideration of additional Offerors is warranted. In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit technical proposals for the initial task order, the task order summary schedule, and a price proposal for the task order only. The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical quality, performance capability, and cost. Award of the subsequent IDIQ contracts will be made to the Offeror(s) whose proposal(s) is (are) considered to represent the second and up to a target of four best value(s) to the Government based on the evaluated ratings from Phase 2 and the proposed price for the initial task order.</p>
<p>The following evaluation (rating) criteria listed below shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals:</p>
<p>Phase 1 - Experience (most important factor), Technical Approach (less important than Experience, but more important than Past Performance), and Past Performance (least important factor).</p>
<p>Phase 2 - Construction Approach for the task order; Summary Schedule for the task order, Price. All technical factors (Construction Approach and Summary Schedule) when combined are significantly more important than Price.</p>
<p>4. SUBMISSION INFORMATION: Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 07/31/2016 under solicitation number W9126G-16-R-0064. Phase1 Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 08/31/2016. (approximately 30 days from issuance of the solicitation). If the Government elects to conduct a Pre-Proposal Conference and site visit for Phase 2, it will be conducted after the Phase 2 selection has been made. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 237310 (Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction), which corresponds to SIC 1611. The Small Business Size Standard is $36.5 Million. The anticipated solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition. There will be no public bid opening. Plans and Specifications will not be provided in a hard paper copy since electronic copy of the solicitation with specifications and drawings will be posted on Fed Biz Opps (www.fbo.gov). Prospective contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award. Lack of registration in the SAM database will make offeror ineligible for award. Information on SAM registration &amp; ORCA can be obtained at http://www.sam.gov.</p>
