<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services for NIH?s ?Usability and Accessibility Study of a New User Interface for ClinicalTrails.gov.?
 
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 10 weeks from the date of award; not to exceed one year.

PRICING METHOD: Firm should provide a single firm fixed price, not to exceed US$46,325.

TASK DESCRIPTION: ClinicalTrials.gov (www.ClinicalTrials.gov) is the world?s largest registry of clinical trials, aiming to provide comprehensive clinical trials information to interested parties, including but not limited to patients, medical researchers and healthcare providers. The site currently contains over 47,000 clinical studies sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, other federal agencies, and private industry from 153 countries. Recent rapid growth of the public?s awareness of ClinicalTrials.gov as well as a number of policies to foster transparency in clinical research has led to the diversification of user groups and corresponding information needs and questions brought to the registry. In order to better serve various user needs, we would like to conduct an evaluation of the usability and accessibility of the ?new? ClinicalTrials.gov site to inform the overall design of the user interface (UI), how well it answers specific users' needs (including accessibility under Section 508), and user experience with the site. The external contractor involved in the project will perform the following set of tasks:

?	Identify potential venues for recruiting participants from various user groups.
?	Conduct participant recruitment and selection of representatives from different user groups targeted. Selection criteria include: profession and prior experience at ClinicalTrials.gov as well as gender, age group, and Web experience.
?	Develop scenarios and tasks for the usability testing for each user group.
?	Identify and/or develop a usability survey instrument, including user satisfaction.
?	Develop a script for the facilitator to use during user testing.
?	Conduct formal usability testing, including both free-form exploration and pre-specified scenarios/tasks (i.e., think-aloud method), to analyze user interactions with the UI. Users will be encouraged to interact with the UI to address information needs not represented in the pre-specified tasks.
?	Use data capture (video, user keystrokes/mouse logging) during each session for post-session analyses of user interactions, both qualitatively (e.g., UI feature use patterns) and quantitatively (e.g., number of mouse clicks).
?	Conduct semi-structured interviews with users to obtain direct feedback on her/his experience, elicit comparisons with the existing UI (for ?experienced participants? only), and seek out additional user needs.


?	Use formal accessibility evaluation tools (e.g., Watchfire?s WebXM) to evaluate compliance with Section 508 guidelines.
?	Use hands-on evaluation by a user(s) familiarity with a range of online assistive technologies to review accessibility from a user-perspective.


1.0	.	Program goals
Program goals relevant to this evaluation are:

a.	Providing access to information about clinical trials through a user-friendly interface, for a variety of user groups (e.g., patients, physicians, researchers), including users with disabilities and specific needs.
b.	Developing search mechanisms to support users in finding clinical studies easily and assessing the relevance of query results rapidly (e.g., potential enrollment), including advanced features for experienced users.
c.	Displaying information about clinical research studies in useful formats that support different user tasks (e.g., understanding the purpose and design of a study, comparing several studies, obtaining contact information).
d.	Providing additional information to facilitate exploration of the registered clinical research studies through query reformulation (e.g., filtering or narrowing the scope by trial location, providing related terms and topics) or selecting to ?browse? studies by topic categories.
The evaluation will provide empirical user data on how well the new interface features work and how to fine-tune or revise them, as needed.

2.0	.	 Recruitment
	Participant recruitment and selection will seek representatives from different user groups. Selection criteria include: professional ?role? (i.e., patient/consumer, healthcare professional, and clinical researcher) and prior experience at ClinicalTrials.gov (i.e., yes/no) as well as gender, age group, and Web experience. In addition to querying a contractor?s in-house database of participants, brief descriptions of the study goals, methodology, anticipated time commitment, and contact information will be posted (physically and/or electronically) at locations appropriate for each user group identified by the contractor, such as:
?	Patient/Consumer: public clinics, Wheaton Library Health Information Center
?	Healthcare Professional: local hospitals (e.g., Suburban) and clinics 
?	Clinical Researchers: academic medical centers (e.g., Georgetown), NIH Clinical Center

Contractor will then proceed to recruit, screen, and select all participants (up to 54 in all) for the study from the user groups outlined above, both with and without ClinicalTrials.gov experience (up to 9 participants from each of the 6 ?role? x ?prior experience? user groups).




3.0	.	Facilities and Equipment
The contractor shall be able to perform usability testing at their own facilities or, if available, at the National Cancer Institute?s User-Centered Informatics Research Laboratory, which is no-charge to Government agencies.  Facilities costs for the usability lab must be included as part of the total cost. The facility selected should be adequate for conducting usability tests such as the one described as part of this Needs Assessment.  The usability tests will be conducted at a usability lab where ClinicalTrials.gov/NLM staff can watch the proceedings, preferably from behind a one-way mirror.  The lab shall accommodate persons with disabilities.  The contractor will videotape usability testing sessions, with permission of the participants, and will supply ClinicalTrials.gov/NLM with copies of the unedited tapes, and all data capture files (e.g., keystroke logs) at the conclusion of the study.

The contractor shall also conduct formal accessibility analysis on the ClinicalTrials.gov site using appropriate tools and submit the results of the evaluation based on Section 508 guidelines.

4.0	.	Analysis
The contractor shall summarize the data, analyze it to determine the most pressing usability and all accessibility problems, and make recommendations for resolving those problems.  The contractor shall also make recommendations for desirable new features based on usability data, self-reported user satisfaction, and direct feedback and observation of study participants.

5.0.	Reports
The contractor shall deliver the following:
1)	A concise Microsoft Word final summary report, including an executive summary, methods, and recommendations.  
2)	A Microsoft Power Point presentation outlining all findings from each user group, including user satisfaction (survey) results.

In addition, the contractor will brief the ClinicalTrials.gov team.

6.0.	Milestones

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: The Trimble brand PDA is a preassembled ruggedized and waterproof device. It does not require a waterproof enclosure to be added.

<DESC>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has a requirement for 20, 30-gallon drums of Dibrom 14 to control mosquitoes in outlying areas of KSC, where the use of aerial equipment is necessary to apply chemicals to areas impossible to spray without an aircraft.   Dibrom 14 is supplied annually by KSC to the Brevard County Mosquito Control District (BCMCD) in accordance with the Mosquito Control Agreement between KSC, Air Force Eastern Test Range, US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and Brevard County.  AMVAC Chemical Corporation, the manufacturer of Dibrom 14, has verified that Adapco, Incorporated of Sanford, Florida as the sole distributor of this product for the state of Florida. Other authorized distributors are prohibited from distributing the product beyond their state or assigned territory. Dibrom 14 is an adulticide used to control mosquitoes. There are several areas at the Launch Pads and Launch Complex 39, where normal chemicals used at KSC cannot be sprayed due to chemical corrosiveness and flight hardware. Moreover, these areas are also very large and impossible to spray without an aircraft, which KSC does not possess. The Mosquito Control Agreement provides the equipment (aircraft) to spray large areas of water in the KSC area to control mosquitoes without having to spray directly around the pads. KSC procures and supplies the Dibrom 14 to BCMCD for spraying. Dibrom 14 is the only chemical that can be used, because it is the only chemical BCMCD is licensed to spray in the KSC and impound areas.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 PM EST on Friday, March 7, 2008. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>CONSTELLATION PROGRAM GROUND PROCESSING The purpose of this notice is to apprise interested parties of the current planning schedule for competition of the Constellation (Cx) ground processing, provide high level information on the potential requirements, acquisition approach, and solicit industry input.	 NASA currently plans a scope of work which will include Constellation Program ground processing, assembly, integration, test, launch and recovery services to support the Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV), including the First Stage, Upper Stage, the Instrument Unit, and the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV).  Also included are the associated Ground Support facilities, equipment operations and maintenance and the related exploration architecture systems that will provide capabilities necessary for human space flight and exploration of the solar system.  The scope of work may include Space Shuttle transition and retirement efforts and advanced planning for the Ares V Cargo Launch Vehicle and the lunar lander, Altair. NASA?s procurement strategy for these requirements is still under development.	NASA may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) that contains multiple Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) for specific requirements to create a flexible competitive acquisition approach where NASA could award separate CLINs to potentially different offerors, or award all CLINs to one offeror, depending on competitive solutions provided by industry and the best value to the Government.  NASA is currently weighing its options for creating these separate CLINs for specific requirements.   Based upon the contemplated scope and source selection approach discussed above, NASA requests industry input 1) regarding the best way to segregate the requirements to allow for an efficient and appropriate source selection and to achieve efficient and effective contract performance, 2) any potential issues that may arise regarding the above approach, and 3) any other relevant input.  All input / recommendations should include supporting rationale.  Identify in the response a recommended CLIN approach that would not place undue burden on proposal resources while providing NASA the best value.   We are currently planning for an industry briefing late summer of this year, release of an RFP during the spring 2009, and contract selection(s) and award(s) in spring of 2010, with contract performance beginning no later than October 2010. This notice is issued to solicit responses from interested parties.  This document is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition.  Additional background details regarding these requirements can be found in the attached Constellation Program Ground Processing Services Request for Information (RFI), originally posted on February 8, 2007. NASA reserves the right to share the information submitted in response to this notice throughout NASA and to use it in NASA?s formulation of one or more solicitations seeking competitive proposals on contracts for or related to the requirements described in the RFI titled ?RFI-KSC-GPS?.  However, any competition sensitive data should be clearly marked.   Information submitted in response to this notice will not be posted on any website or public access location.  Responses are not subject to a page limitation and should be submitted to the Contracting Officer no later than March 13, 2008. An Industry Day announcement, containing time and location details as well as registration information, will be posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=76 ).   Potential offerors should notify the Contracting Officer of their interest in this procurement.  All questions and comments should be directed to the Contracting Officer, Tammy Burlein at 321-867-3484 or tammy.s.burlein@nasa.gov.  This presolicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.	Respondents will not be notified of the results. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/KSC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=76  .

- Training needs to reflect current systems, threats, and Tactics, Training, and Procedures (TTP)
- Tools and Decision Aids for ASW team assessments of Active Sonar Operation which can be utilized among the training stakeholders (i.e. school house, ATGs and integrated trainers)
- An ability to reduce the "Sound in the Water" so than one might practice the routines in port and then be able to get "Quality Training" at sea
- Cost effective solutions that leverage current technologies, as applicable
- Generally focus on Active Sonar Warfighter Skills

Objectives (end state): Single point solutions do not need to explicitly address every objective however any solution should address how the solutions/capability can address the objectives.

- An ASW Trainer Capability That that supports the Active problem
- Provides active ASW proficiency training for mission rehearsal
- Meets elements as defined by 2nd/3rd fleet brief -
   o High Resolution Ocean Environment
   o Accurate Interference Environment
   o Accurate Contact Signature Representation
   o Real-World Non-Acoustic Environment
   o Real-World Acoustic Environment
   o Certified Surface Threat Representation

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System-INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE. The VA Boston Healthcare System intends to negotiate and procure on a sole source basis. It is neither a solicitation announcement nor a request for proposals or quotes and does not obligate the Government to award a contract.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract to Yankee Equipment which holds the patent to the Chicago Edge MAXX cornerless spreader/feeder with dual inputs designed for high speed, 120 usable width.  The requirements for this spreader/feeder are: 1.	A cornerless feeding system that an employee does not need to take the time to find corners of flatwork in order to feed the item.  2.	Eliminate the potential pulling of sheets-end to end, (clip on system) it virtually eliminates the premature tearing of sheets, therefore conceptually sheets last longer before being disposed of (fair-wear and tear reduced) 3.	Achieve production requirements of up to 1,800 pieces per hour the number of employees required to accommodate this feeding requirement is eliminated from 4-5 FTEE-feeding and pulling to 2-3 FTEE (feeding and pulling) 4.	Does not drag across the floor prior to entering the machine (ironer).  The clip on systems do allow sheets to drag on the floor and this has been cited by several JCAHO inspectors in the past as a sanitation challenge and by   OSHA        as a tripping hazard to employees feeding the iron. This acquisition will be accomplished using commercial services procedures in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 12, and the justification for other than full and open competition is in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  Any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. All information submitted in response to this announcement must be received by March 5th, 3pm EST.  This information can be faxed or emailed to Kimberly Perkins.  My e-mail address is Kimberly.Perkins3@med.va.gov and my fax number is 1-774-826-1229.  Responses will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Please no phone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Amendment to Solicitation No. AG-91S8-S-08-0001.

The purpose of this amendment is to (1) amend the solicitation and (2) provide a response to solicitation questions.  

1)  This solicitation is herby amended as follows:  US Department of Agriculture clause AGAR 452.237-74 Key Personnel (FEB 1988) is applicable to the Registered Professional Forester identified in Section B under Item No. 2, which is also identified in Section C 1.1, page 21 of this solicitation.  (Note, as a result of this amendment, the Registered Professional Forester positions identified under Item No. 2 and Item No. 3 are now Key Personnel positions.)


2)  Following are four questions and the Government response to solicitation questions:  

QUESTION ONE: Bid item #1 is hourly rates for Crew Chief and Data Collector, Bid Item #3 is for Professional Registered Forester (PRF). Is it possible that these items will be awarded to separate firms?  Then would the successful proposer for Item #3 then be required to conduct Quality Assurance (QA) inspections on his competitor, the awarded contractor for Bid Item #1?  

RESPONSE:  It is possible that these items could be awarded to the same firm, or to separate firms.  The RPF identified in Item #3 may inspection work performed through Item #1, as well as carry out other work required by the Government.  


QUESTION TWO: On page 40 you are asking for a price per plot by difficulty rating.  Should this price include the services and time of a PRF for QA inspections or just Crew Chief and Data Collector?  Are these prices that you will be using for awarding work in the first year of this project?  

RESPONSE:  Item #1 price per plot by difficulty rating should not include services and time of an RPF.  The RPF function will be performed by the firm awarded Item #3.  The pricing shown in the Schedule of Items (Section B) will be used to award work during the first year of the project.  When Individual tasks are advertised for inventory projects (Bid Item #1), pricing should be fully loaded including hourly rates, direct costs, indirect costs, travel, overhead or GA, profit, incidental materials costs, supervision and management of personnel as shown in ?Notes and Inclusion to the Schedule of Items? of the solicitation.  The cost and price, which vendors will prepare for the Pilot Project shown on page 40 of the solicitation, will be used to award the first project for Fiscal Year 2008.  


QUESTION THREE: Can you clarify if the RPF is supposed to be a third party or if our firm could provide both the RPF and timber cruisers.  

RESPONSE:  An RPF is required for Item #2.  Any firm awarded Item #2 (Stand Exam) requires an RPF to be part of that firm's personnel for award and project performance.  
Item #3 is specifically for RPF services, and will be required to perform Q/A inspections on work performed under Item #1, or other work as determined by the Government.  
If a firm does not currently have one or more RPF?s on staff, your proposal must identify subcontractor(s) and specific personnel who will provide RPF services for either Item number 2 or 3.  
If one firm is awarded both Item number 2 and 3, that firm will be required to provide RPF services for both items.  These services could be provided by the same RPF only if it does not adversely affect the work performance or schedule of any other item, as determined by the Government.  


QUESTION FOUR:  I noticed that you took out any administrative time from plot price.  Therefore all the recruiting, training, supervision, other overhead and accounting, profit, risk, data review, plot edit tools must be embedded in the crew leader and data recorder per hour prices for the time spent on the ground.  Also you want such sundries such as data recorders, GPS, computers, all insurances embedded in the labor costs and not itemized as I have done in the past. Only vehicle, travel and per diem would be separate. Is that correct?  

RESPONSE:  Recruiting, training, supervision, etc. are considered either overhead or G&A.  Sundries such as data recorders, GPS, computers, and insurance are considered either overhead, G&A, or customary incidental tools.  Therefore, these costs should be included within the fully loaded hourly rates.  Included below for review are Notes and Inclusions to the Schedule of Items, number 3, 5, and 11.  

Note 3:  All hourly labor rates are to be fully loaded, inclusive of direct costs, indirect costs, overhead or GA, profit, incidental materials costs, supervision and management of personnel.  

Note 5:  Major equipment shall be negotiated as required for a specific task order.  Customary incidental tools of the trade and equipment shall be included within the hourly rates.   

Note 11:  Travel shall be limited by rates established in the Federal Travel Regulations for localities where the work is performed.  Personnel shall use the most economical means of travel.?  

End of Amendment and Government Response to Questions.

Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number and identification of business size in accordance with the size standard for NAIC 541620 which is $6.5 million.  Title of Project:  Best Practices for Shellfish Mariculture and a Scientific Review of Ecological Effects in Drake's Estero Description:  The work of this proposed contract action consists of two phases represented by two separate reports prepared by an independent scientific panel of experts.  The first report is an evaluation that establishes what is known or can reasonably be surmised of the ecological effects of the existing commercial mariculture operation on the Drake's Estero ecosystem and whether the National Park Service derived the correct conclusions from existing related scientific studies.  The second report, which is subject to funds availability, will assess the nature and degree to which commercial mariculture operations affect natural ecosystems more widely.  The reports must be independent analysis of existing research, that is above reproach, and whose findings would be accepted without question and above dispute. Type of Procurement: A negotiated sole source cost reimbursable contract is anticipated.  Range: First Phase: $200,000-$250,000; Second Phase: $200,000 - $250,000 Draft Statement of Work Solicitation No. N8074080026 February 20, 2008 Best Practices for Shellfish Mariculture and a Scientific Review of Ecological Effects in Drake's Estero, Pt. Reyes National Seashore, California ABSTRACT The National Park Service (NPS) requests that the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) convene a committee to assess the nature and degree to which commercial mariculture operations affect natural ecosystems and to produce two reports based on that assessment.  The first report will be a short report addressing the specific case of a commercial shellfish farm in Drake's Estero, which lies within Pt. Reyes National Seashore.  This short report will include an evaluation of the existing body of scientific studies and a comparison of the committee's assessment of that body of scientific studies to an earlier assessment offered by the National Park Service in its public documents and statements.  The committee's second report will assess the potential ecosystem effects of shellfish mariculture more broadly and will identify best practices needed to maintain ecosystem integrity in a system experiencing shellfish mariculture.  To this end, the committee will examine how ecological effects vary in magnitude with the scale of the mariculture operation and with its duration, what uncertainties surround our understanding of these ecological effects, and what are the most important subjects for future research to minimize any environmental impacts that the assessment might identify. BACKGROUND Mariculture, a specialized branch of aquaculture, is the cultivation of marine organisms in the natural environment. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that aquaculture is the fastest growing form of global food production, accounting for about 25% of total world fish production. Aquaculture and mariculture operations depend upon natural ecosystems and their associated ecosystem services. This dependence of managed fish and shellfish stocks on natural systems raises questions both regarding whether aquaculture supplements wild fish stocks or contributes to the depletion of world fisheries and also regarding concerns about genetic diversity in hatchery-raised species compared to wild species, the effect of types of feeds used in mariculture operations, and the effects of mariculture operations on the natural systems within which they are conducted.  To ensure effective incorporation of aquaculture into the longer-term outlook for managing the fisheries of the future, managers will need to have fisheries science analyze the trends in aquaculture and capture fisheries, examine their interdependencies, and assess their potential environmental effects. Past research has indicated that shellfish mariculture can have a range of effects on natural habitat, other marine species, and human health, some of which are considered positive and others that have raised concern about expansion of the mariculture industry.  Some examples of changes to natural habitat include increased water clarity (oysters filter large quantities of water), habitat diversity (introduction of new substrate), introduction of nonnative species (both hitchhikers and cultured species), and change in the prevalence and types of shellfish diseases and parasites.  There are also questions about how the scale and location of mariculture operations influence ecosystem-level effects (e.g., habitat types, hydrographic setting, carrying capacity, physical disturbance, species shifts, benthic deposition), relative health risks of wild and cultured shellfish (e.g., vibrio, PSP, heavy metal accumulation), and competition with wild stocks and fisheries dependent on those stocks (e.g., commercial harvesting of kelp for abalone aquaculture, natural geoduck beds versus exclusive permitting of geoduck bottoms for aquaculture). Drake's Estero lies within Pt. Reyes National Seashore, a unit of the National Park System.  Drake's Estero is designated as potential wilderness pending expiration of a Reservation of Use and Occupancy (RUO) held by a commercial shellfish farm that expires in 2012.  The Reservation of Use and Occupancy permits the commercial farm to operate an oyster and clam mariculture operation in the Estero using lands and waters within the boundary of the Seashore. There is disagreement regarding the nature of and degree to which the commercial operation affects the natural ecosystem of Drake's Estero and disagreement about NPS's assessment of recent studies of the Estero.  To address these disagreements, NPS requests the NAS to conduct an evaluation that establishes what is known or can reasonably be surmised about the ecological effects of the commercial operation on the Drake's Estero ecosystem, to assess the NPS assessment in comparison to this evaluation, and to assess the nature and degree to which commercial mariculture operations affect ecosystems more widely. III. PLAN OF ACTION The requested NAS review is to include the following components: Statement of Task: NAS will convene an ad hoc committee to produce two reports on shellfish mariculture in coastal areas. In the first report, the committee will assess the scientific basis for NPS presentations and for various revisions of an NPS report ("Drake's Estero: A Sheltered Wilderness Estuary") regarding the ecological effects of the commercial shellfish farm operations on Drake's Estero, Pt. Reyes National Seashore in California.  In carrying out this first task, the committee will address the following questions: "	What is the body of scientific studies on the impact of the oyster farm on Drake's Estero, and what have they shown? "	What effects can be directly demonstrated by research conducted in Drake's Estero itself? "	What effects can reasonably be inferred from research conducted in similar ecosystems? "	What conclusions can be drawn from the body of scientific studies, and how do they compare with what the NPS presented to the public? Have these conclusions affected NPS decision making? "	What are the most important subjects for future research to better understand the ecological consequences of anthropogenic influences on the Estero, so as to inform NPS decision making? For the second report, the committee will look more broadly at the potential ecosystem effects of shellfish mariculture and will identify best practices that shellfish mariculture could use to maintain ecosystem integrity.  To this end, the committee will address the following questions: "	What are the ecological effects of mariculture and how do they vary in magnitude by duration, operation size, harvest intensity, species cultivated, habitat type, and geographic location (e.g., effects on carrying capacity, water clarity, physical disturbance, species shifts, diseases, benthic deposition)? "	What are the uncertainties surrounding these ecological effects? "	How do the ecological effects of mariculture compare with the harvest of wild populations? "	Does shellfish mariculture reduce the harvest pressure on wild populations? "	What are the risks for the spread of nonnative species and how could these risks be reduced? "	What socioeconomic factors influence the size and location of shellfish mariculture activities (e.g., "not in my backyard" [NIMBY] issues, economic parameters [permitting/leases for seabed, price stability, labor, transportation], local traditions)? "	What are the most important subjects for future research to better understand and manage the ecosystem responses to mariculture operations? This second report will use the answers to these questions as the basis for identifying best management practices that could be employed to enhance the benefits of shellfish mariculture and minimize any negative ecological effects. Funding for the second report is not awarded as part of the base contract, but is intended to be added via modification. Consideration of Balance: The NAS committee will represent a breadth of expertise and perspectives on shellfish mariculture issues, including marine ecology and marine resource management. The committee membership will be drawn mostly from around the United States, but one or two members may come from outside the United States. Preliminary Work Plan: NAS will appoint a committee of 8 members, including the chair. The committee will meet up to four times over the 18-month study period.  The first report, on Drake's Estero, will be delivered to NPS nine months after contract award. Prior to the start of the study, the NAS will impress upon the sponsor (NPS) and the commercial shellfish farm (1) the role of the committee in conducting the scientific study and preparing reports; and (2) that decisions on commercial activities in Drake's Estero are not within the committee's purview. Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA): The Academy will implement its interim policies and procedures for Section 15 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. App.  15 regarding public access and conflicts of interest that are applicable to agreements under which the Academy, using a committee, provides advice or recommendations to a Federal agency.  In accordance with these policies and procedures, the Academy shall submit to the government sponsor(s) following delivery of each applicable report a certification that the policies and procedures of the Academy that implement Section 15 of FACA have been substantially complied with in the performance of the contract with respect to the applicable report. Public Information about the Project: In order to afford the public greater knowledge of Academy activities and an opportunity to provide comments on those activities, the NPS expects the Academy to post on its website (http://www.national-academies.org) the following information as appropriate under its procedures: (1) notices of meetings open to the public; (2) brief descriptions of projects; (3) committee appointments, if any (including biographies of committee members); (4) report information; and (5) any other pertinent information.) Products: The committee will prepare two reports that will summarize its powerful, independent, and disinterested analysis and that will present conclusions expected to be accepted without question because of its position and reputation.  These reports specifically will include analyses and conclusions that address the questions identified in the section on Statement of Task.  The first report will be due nine months after contract award.  The second report, funding for which is intended to be added via modification, will be due approximately 18 months after contract award, subject to funds availability. IV.

<DESC>Compounds with Potential for Pharmacologic Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorders

The mission of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism is to promote research on the causes, prevention and treatment of alcohol use disorders.  The goal of the Institute?s Medication Development Program is to facilitate the development of promising pharmacologic agents for treatment of alcohol use disorders (AUD) from Preclinical Testing to Phase 1 to Phase 2 efficacy evaluation.  The purpose of this announcement is to identify organizations with ownership of, license to, or other access to compounds which may be potentially safe and effective for the treatment of alcohol use disorders.

The organizations with a compound(s) of interest should specify in their capabilities statement whether they possess the following information on the compound(s): (1) a theoretical or other rationale supporting its potential usefulness in AUD treatment; (2) animal toxicology data sufficient for IND purposes; (3) pharmacokinetic profile (4) human safety data, and (5) an existing or pending IND.  Medications already marketed for other indications are acceptable.  Desirable additional data includes: promising performance in established animal models of alcohol addiction and/or human laboratory models. Organizations need not disclose proprietary information; if necessary, confidentiality agreements between the organization and the Government can be established at a subsequent stage of discussion to protect confidential information.

Organizations of any size, public or private may respond.  This announcement is to identify organizations with promising compounds for further discussion and possible collaboration.  Funding and/or collaboration with the government are not guaranteed or implicit in this announcement.  

Capabilities statements should briefly describe the organization?s size and scope, any relevant drug development history, and the extent to which their compound(s) meet(s) the criteria described above.  Capabilities Statements are due no later than 3 March 2008 to the following address:

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to state the Government?s intent to increase personnel on the bridge requirement to support an increase in annual training quotas.  The increase in number of personnel will also be incorporated into the competitive solicitation, number H92239-07-R-0006.  All other terms and conditions in the bridge contract will remain unchanged.  Inquiries shall be directed to Ms. Umetria Thomas, Contract Specialist at thomasu@soc.mil or 910-432-6145.  Due to the potential for non-receipt of e-mail responses, it is the contractor's responsibility to ensure e-mail requests have been received. END AMENDMENT INFORMATION.

This is a notice of intent to negotiate a firm fixed price six month bridge contract with Global Services Corp, 245 Westlake Road, Fayetteville, NC 28314.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Global Services Corp under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements?.  The US Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) currently has a contract for the provision of Medical Instructors and Support Services for Special Operations Forces (SOF) Medical Courses offered by the Joint Special Operations Medical Training Center (JSOMTC), US Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School under contract number USZA92-02-C-0004.  The contract is due to expire on August 31, 2007.  However, due to delays in the acquisition process, a six month bridge contract will be awarded to allow time to conduct a competitive acquisition and a new contract can be awarded.  The anticipated release date for the competitive solicitation is 17 September 2007.  The period of performance for the bridge contract is 01 September 2007 through 29 February 2008 and the primary place of performance is Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  

The requirement is for medical instructors, as well as a wide variety of services to support the classroom instruction and facility.  Examples of the instructor support include advanced medical instructors, paramedic instructors, and veterinarians.  The support services include logistics, engineering (IT/AV), and personnel/administrative functions.  Examples of the support required in the administrative and logistical areas are: development/implementation of training, development of training aids, and the life-cycle support of the military training systems including the installed audio-visual, communications, and information technology systems as well as their supporting electrical, electronic, and electro-mechanical equipment.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed effort on a full and open competition basis is solely the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for consideration under the upcoming competitive procurement.  On March 21, 2007, the contracting office issued a sources sought notice to determine interest in the new solicitation (announcement number SSUT0702-JSOMTC).  Based on the responses to the sources sought notice, the Government made the determination to proceed with the new requirement on a competitive basis as a small business set-aside.  Please see pre-solicitation announcement number H92239-07-R-0006, issued on June 18, 2007, for additional information.  Inquiries shall be directed to Ms. Umetria Thomas, Contract Specialist at thomasu@soc.mil or 910-432-6145.  Due to the potential for non-receipt of e-mail responses, it is the contractor's responsibility to ensure e-mail requests have been received.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION Pursuant to FAR 15.202 Woody Biomass Utilization Awareness for US Forest Service DOI/NBC/Acquisition Services Directorate - Herndon (AQD-Herndon) will handle this Request for Information.  AQD-Herndon is a Federal Franchise Fund Contracting Office under the authority of the Government Management Reform Act and provides contracting support to all Federal and D0D Agencies.  For an easier to read format of this RFI please go to our website at www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp.   INTRODUCTION The US Forest Service is seeking firms that, if any, can provide all the following services:  work throughout the twenty-state Northeastern Area with a variety of state and local partners to increase the sustainable use of woody biomass for energy and other products.  Develop a draft implementation plan for conducting work under this contract;  Finalize this implementation plan with the COTR;  Provide annual updates to the implementation plan in cooperation with the COTR;  Annually conduct at least 2 educational seminars related to expanding the sustainable use of woody biomass in the Northeastern Area;  Develop an inventory of existing woody biomass utilization facilities in the Northeast and Midwest 20 states; Annually conduct at least 6 assessments of woody biomass utilization opportunities in cooperation with State forestry agencies;  Annually develop at least 3 publications on woody biomass utilization technology, markets, or success stories;  Annually develop 3 information products that provide decision-makers with the ability to assess how the use of woody biomass will improve the ecological, economic, and/or social conditions in their environment;  Provide advice and analytical assistance to the COTR on opportunities to expand the sustainable use of woody biomass;  Work with the Woody Biomass Utilization Services Contractor(s) to develop enhanced tools for preliminary feasibility analysis;  Work with the Woody Biomass Utilization Services Contractor(s) to develop information products describing the use of wood as an energy resource; and develop working relationships with the wood combustion appliance industry/boiler manufacturers to improve the quality of small to medium scale solid wood combustion systems available in the US. BACKGROUND Woody biomass utilization is a key component of restoring and maintaining ecosystem health. "Woody biomass" is defined as the trees and woody plants, including limbs, tops, needles, leaves, and other woody parts, grown in a forest, woodland, or rangeland environment, that are the by-products of restoration, hazardous fuel reduction treatments (including urban forests), and forest management.  At the national level the Forest Service, through the Woody Biomass Utilization Strategy (http://www.fs.fed.us/woodybiomass/) commits to following three principles to achieve four goals:  Principles	Goals 1. Pursue sustainability.	1.	 Supply 2. Empower entrepreneurial action.	2. Partnerships 3. Use science-based information and new technology	3. Science and Technology 	4. Marketing The new Northeastern Area strategic plan includes an objective on the sustainable use of forest resources to produce renewable energy and accomplish greenhouse gas reduction.  Objective 2B states: Help the Northeast and Midwest meet its need for renewable energy and greenhouse gas reduction through the sustainable utilization of woody biomass. The Wood Education and Resource Center (WERC) staff, working in cooperation with other Forest Service staff and local partners, is charged with addressing Objective 2B.  WERC staff with input from NA staff groups and partners has developed a business plan to guide implementation of NA efforts related to the sustainable utilization of woody biomass.  This business plan identifies the need for increased awareness, training and education across the Northeastern Area about the opportunities to use woody biomass. These opportunities range from using wood for energy to the development of chemicals from wood extractives. Providing such awareness, technical assistance, and training to communities and businesses related to the opportunities for the use of woody biomass is consistent with both National and Area strategies. PURPOSE OF THIS REQUEST Contemplated Requirement:  The Government would like to know what firms can provide all the following services for this requirement by identifying themselves and responding to this RFI.  The Government requests recommendations, comments, concerns, and/or questions relating to the contemplated support services. 1.1.	An overall plan and timeline describing how they will accomplish the scope of work described above and the specific tasks needed to accomplish the goal of increasing the sustainable use of woody biomass for energy and other products across the Northeastern Area at the end of the first year of the contract and providing technical assistance and analytical support to the COTR as requested.  This plan will be developed after an initial meeting with WERC staff and the COTR to review the scope of work and make sure the contractor understands what is expected.  Finalizing the work plan and timeline may require approximately two (2) additional meetings with the COTR.  Some of the meetings may include representatives of the Northeastern Area Association of State Foresters Utilization and Marketing Committee.  Additional meetings with the Forest Service will be required to identify strategic work items. 1.2.	Organize and conduct two meetings/seminars/training sessions annually that address key woody biomass management and utilization issues in the Northeast and Midwest.  The topics for these sessions will be selected based on negotiation between the Contractor and the COTR/WERC staff.  Initial topics may include sustainability, carbon sequestration in wood products, appropriate harvesting technologies, new combustion technologies, district energy applications for woody biomass, and air quality concerns with biomass utilization.  It is expected that two sessions should address national/area-wide issues and two sessions should address sub-regional/local issues. 1.3.	Develop an inventory of existing and planned (within 2-5 years) biomass utilizing facilities across the Northeast and Midwest.  This inventory will identify the utilization technology, the volume of material used, residues created, the amount of energy created and the form of energy created (thermal/electrical/both). This information will be geo-coded and compatible with ARCINFO products. 1.4.	Conduct sub-regional analyses of biomass utilization opportunities in cooperation with potential biomass users, State Forestry agencies, and the Wood Energy Utilization Services Contractors.  Opportunities to conduct these analyses will develop as the Wood Energy Utilization Services Contractors identify and analyze energy conversion opportunities on a variety of scales.  These analyses will utilize data collected by the Forest Inventory and Analysis staff as well as additional data provided by the State Forester or other data sources.  Additional data will be provided by the biomass utilization inventory developed in 4.3 above. Format of these analyses will be negotiated with the COTR. 1.5.	Develop a series of information products to help decision-makers better understand the opportunities created by sustainable biomass utilization in the Northeast and Midwest.  These information products will address sustainability, harvesting, combustion/gasification, air quality, district energy systems, new technologies at different scales, and financing options. Other topics may be included based on future program needs.  These information products will be developed in formats that can be shared on the WERC website and on electronic media such as CD and/or DVD. Topics and format of these information products will be negotiated with the COTR. These information products will be reviewed by the COTR prior to finalizing the products.  These information products must recognize that these materials were develop under a contract with the Forest Service and that information and services will be provided according to all Federal requirements.  The following statements should be included in these information products: 1.5.1.	The work upon which this publication/CD/DVD/software is based was funded in whole or in part through a contract awarded by the Wood Education and Resource Center, Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry, U.S. Department of Agriculture. 1.5.2.	The U.S. Department of Agriculture is an equal opportunity provider and employer. 1.5.3.	The use of trade or firm names in this publication is for reader information and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 1.6.	Develop training products that can be provided to key segments of the public regarding the sustainable use of woody biomass.  These training products will be developed after conducting surveys of key user communities such as legislators, educational institution and hospital administrators, local elected officials, utility officials, developers, land use planners, economic development professionals, foresters, forest land owners and forest products industry representatives.  These training sessions will be sponsored by the WERC.  The format of the training program will be negotiated between the Contractor and the COTR. 1.7.	Provide analytical and technical assistance regarding woody biomass utilization for energy or other uses to the COTR . Such assistance may require up to 480 hours (60 working days) of staff time. 1.8.	Work with the WERC Woody Biomass Utilization Contractor(s) as required by the COTR. Much of this work will be to assist in the development of analytical tools and training programs to help individuals and organizations better understand the potential for the use of woody biomass for energy and other products. 1.9.	Complete monthly work progress reports to the COTR on contacts, on-going feasibility analyses, assigned project progress (including obstacles to project progress), and hours to be billed. 1.10.	Complete an annual report that summarizes the status of the feasibility analyses, includes client progress on implementing feasibility studies, and provides estimates of the overall impact to the use of woody biomass for energy in the Northeastern Area.

<DESC>A.	General Information
The Southwest Region is standardizing for a possible multi-vendor award for Monitoring Catheters & Supplies.  This supersedes Solicitation Number: Reference Number ? N002597207SS02, Monitoring and Central Venous Catheters, Kits and Supplies. The region recognizes this is a specialized category in which vendors may manufacture and/or distribute subsets of the category.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  In order to meet the total requirements of the Region a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items within a product category) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTFs? needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. The product category includes catheters for use in cardiology, vascular and interventional medicine placed centrally or peripherally for short, intermediate, or long term care that provide rapid and effective method for monitoring cardiac pressures, sampling mixed venous blood, and infusing solutions. 
The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Unit?s (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates (i.e. like product items) for elimination, as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.

The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore.

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is May 2008.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.   The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.

C.	Instructions to Vendors 

If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address, your answers to the technical questions/criteria below and product literature to cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil no later than March 20, 2008.  All e-mail communications between vendors and the region will be digitally signed. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.  If your product literature is more than 4MB in size, please mail your product literature to:

Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN 
Tri-Service Regional Business Office 
MSMMO - Southwest Region 
34800 Bob Wilson Drive, Suite 110 
San Diego, CA  92134 
Phone:  (619) 532-8517

This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within the Southwest Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.

The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor?s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

Technical/Company Criteria

1.	Vendors must offer catheters that provide rapid and effective method for monitoring cardiac pressures, sampling mixed venous blood, and infusing solutions like Kit Blood Sampling Flush Squeeze 60INL Line Blood Port X 2; Catheter Set Radial Artery 20Ga; Catheter Swan Ganz Continuous Cardiac Output; Thermodilution Catheter 5L,8F,110CM  with Heparin; Truwave VAMP Combo 160 Kit; Truwave DPT 60" Single Line; Monitoring Set Arterial Pressure Sterile; Catheter Kit Arterial PTFE 20G Female; Kit Transducer Pressure Single Line Neonatal/Pediatric; & VAMP Direct Draw. Vendors must provide a list of the products they supply in this product line and the brand name to include the type, size and configuration.
2.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the Prime Vendor supporting our Region, Cardinal Health or will be disqualified.
3.	Vendors must have a DAPA number or is in the process of obtaining a DAPA or will be disqualified.
4.	Your product line must be latex free and this must be indicated on the packaging of the product.
5.	Vendors must provide product literature for this product line.
6.	Vendors must provide 24/7 customer support and identify company resources for such support with their initial submittals.
7.	Vendors must submit prices lower than their DAPA or will be disqualified. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, national FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA.
8.	Your products must meet the FDA requirements for medical devices.
9.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic excel format upon request.
10.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls/alerts that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for monitoring catheters and supplies including dates, duration, cause, and resolution with their initial submittals.  This represents your sole opportunity to present this information. Provide any mitigating factors that you may have in order to provide a proper context for the cited back orders, recalls, etc.

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   

The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Not Acceptable, 2 = Minimally Acceptable, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Acceptable, and 5 = Highly Acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the ?break?, in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.

A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.

Clinical/Performance Criteria

1.	The catheter can be inserted easily and smoothly to prevent trauma to the tissue and vessel.
2.	The maximum barrier feature protects the user against blood borne pathogen exposure.
3.	The catheter is made of high quality sturdy material that resists kinks, bends and breakage to prevent injury to the patient.
4.	The catheter has a feature that prevents needlestick injury to prevent the transmission of blood borne pathogens.
5.	The catheter can be connected securely to tubing and other monitoring equipment to prevent leakage.

Phase III ? Pricing Analysis Process.  All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.

The Southwest Region is seeking product line items in the category of Kits, Insertion / Change for Monitoring & Central Venous & Catheters. The region requires Chloraprep be the antiseptic skin preparation in the insertion and change kits and Tegaderm be the transparent dressing in the insertion and change kits. Although, prime vendor report indicates an annual sale of only $10K, the potential volume is high as indicated by the same PV report showing more than 15,000 units of central venous and monitoring catheters are inserted and at least 5,000 units changed annually. For each catheter insertion there is at least one dressing change therefore, a corresponding number of change/insertion kits will be required to comply with infection control and patient care standards. 

At the request of the Southwest Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the ?break?, in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.

A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.

Clinical/Performance Criteria Evaluation
1.	The sharps in the kit have a safety feature to protect the user against a needlestick injury to prevent blood borne pathogen exposure.
2.	The adhesive does not cause an allergic reaction and can be removed without causing a break in skin integrity.
3.	The Tegaderm transparent dressing is large enough to cover the insertion site to protect against contamination by soil and microorganisms.
4.	The amount of Chloraprep included in the kit is adequate to cleanse the insertion site to eliminate the area from microorganisms that may cause infection if they enter the wound and blood stream.
5.	The gauze dressing is low lint and doesn?t leave fibers in or around the insertion site to keep the lint from contaminating the site.
6.	The contents of the kit are listed on the packaging so the end user can confirm all of the items needed are contained in the kit.
	
Phase III ? Pricing Analysis Process.  All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recognizes the advancement of the commercial suborbital spaceflight industry and seeks to leverage this private investment through a potential procurement of human suborbital spaceflight services.  NASA?s Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is in the formulation phase of a new program to fly government-sponsored payloads and researchers on commercial suborbital systems with the intent of advancing SMD?s goals and objectives. In this RFI, SMD is requesting technical and programmatic input that will be valuable to NASA to (i) evaluate procuring flight services and (ii) aid potential science investigators in scoping and designing possible future suborbital investigations.  Comments to this RFI are welcome from all stakeholders but primarily from potential providers of suborbital spaceflight services.  Suborbital space flight service providers should anticipate flight experiments that address any of the SMD?s research disciplines (Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics, and Planetary Science).  For these human-tended experiments, it is expected that NASA?s on-board researchers may require services such as power, data handling, mounting surfaces, viewing portals, day/night flight opportunities, and flight operations at remote field locations.	NASA is interested in opportunities for externally-mounted experiments as well. With input from responses to this RFI, SMD intends to consider a NASA Research Announcement to solicit proposals from the science and research communities for human-tended experiments that support NASA?s science goals.  For an overview of SMD research focus areas, refer to The Science Plan for NASA?s Science Mission Directorate (2007-2016), available at http://science.hq.nasa.gov/strategy/	 .  In response to this RFI and future program procurement actions, collaboration between the service provider and the research community is encouraged. It is NASA?s current intent to evaluate a formal solicitation for suborbital spaceflight services in early 2009, which would lead to a pilot program of suborbital flight operations in 2010-2011.  The Agency is open to suggestions in this RFI on how best to competitively procure these services while fostering continued private capital investment in this emerging market. If so requested in your response, all information received from this RFI will be considered confidential and proprietary, however NASA will use your response to aid the drafting of an open solicitation for research investigations under NNH08ZDA001N, the Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) 2008 NASA Research Announcement. It is not NASA?s intent to publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtained during this RFI.  To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as ?Proprietary or Confidential? will be kept confidential.  It is emphasized that this RFI is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  Requested Information: NASA seeks both programmatic and technical information from the personal spaceflight community to support SMD?s formulation of a possible Human-In-The-Loop Suborbital Science (HILSS) pilot program.	The information that NASA is seeking includes: Programmatic: ?	Approximate date of suborbital spaceflight service availability ?	Development and flight testing timeline ?	Comments on any and all regulatory, airworthiness, or liability constraints in the development and operation of this service for use by NASA and NASA-sponsored researchers ?	Approximate cost to the government per seat and per flight ?	Government/private partnering needs and/or opportunities Technical: ?	General flight profile information o	Launch/landing sites, trajectory description, flight environments (e.g., accelerations, vibrations), microgravity levels and exposure time, launch windows, potential flight rates, day/night launch constraints for flights in the 2010-2011 timeframe. ?	System information o	Mass/volume availabilities/constraints for PI and experiments o	Power, communications, data storage capabilities/constraints o	Internal experiment mounting capabilities/constraints o	Potential for externally-mounted experiments o	Vehicle pointing capabilities and precision o	Earth/space viewing capabilities/constraints ?

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recognizes the advancement of the commercial suborbital spaceflight industry and requests information on potential human-tended flight experiments enabled by this capability.  NASA?s Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is in the formulation phase of a possible new program to fly government-sponsored payloads and researchers on commercial suborbital systems with the intent of advancing SMD?s goals and objectives.  Responses to this RFI will be used to inform NASA?s program planning. Background: Suborbital missions have provided an important arena for astronomical, terrestrial, and other areas of space research for over 60 years. They offer the opportunity to make astronomical and Earth observations at wavelengths and special observing geometries not accessible from the ground; they also offer the opportunity to study microgravity and other observations related to the fundamental physics of the space and Earth sciences.  Routine accomplishments range, for example, from in-situ sampling of atmospheric regions that neither spacecraft nor aircraft can reach, to examining physical phenomena (e.g., relevant to planetary accretion) in microgravity conditions that are not attainable on the ground or available for such long periods in zero-g aircraft, to testing science instruments before committing to orbital or interplanetary flight. The emergence of human suborbital flight for commercial purposes now offers a natural and timely opportunity to open a new research venue to the scientific community.  In this RFI, NASA is soliciting ideas and comments from the science and research communities on potential human-tended suborbital investigations that support NASA?s science goals.	With input from responses to this RFI, NASA intends to (i) consider acquiring commercial suborbital seats and flights for NASA-funded researchers to conduct human-tended suborbital investigations and (ii) consider a NASA Research Announcement (e.g., via an amendment to Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Science (ROSES) 2008) to solicit proposals for human-tended suborbital investigations that address any of SMD?s research disciplines (Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics, and Planetary Science).  For an overview of SMD research focus areas, refer to The Science Plan for NASA?s Science Mission Directorate (2007-2016), available at http://science.hq.nasa.gov/strategy/   . It is NASA?s current intent to evaluate a formal solicitation for suborbital spaceflight services in early 2009, which would lead to a pilot program of suborbital flight operations in 2010-2011. If so requested in your response, all information received from this RFI will be considered confidential and proprietary, however NASA will use your response to aid the drafting of an open solicitation for research investigations under NNH08ZDA001N, the Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) 2008 NASA Research Announcement. It is not NASA?s intent to publicly disclose proprietary information obtained during this RFI.  To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as ?Proprietary or Confidential? will be kept confidential.  It is emphasized that this RFI is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  Requested Information: The response to this RFI will be in the form of a PDF document that is uploaded through NASA?s NSPIRES system (see instructions below). The response should not exceed three pages in length. The response should contain the following information: ?	Name of submitter and contact information (institutional affiliation, email address); ?	SMD research discipline with which the suborbital investigation is best aligned (Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics, or Planetary Science); ?	Description of the potential science investigation and payload/experiment that can be flown on any of the variety of manned suborbital vehicles being developed for commercial personal spaceflight, including any information that might be useful to NASA in considering what commercial suborbital services would best serve the research community and whether to solicit and/or sponsor human-tended investigations within NASA?s science program. This information might include, but not be limited to: a description of the experiment/investigation including science objectives, the development status of the investigation and when it might be ready for flight, the experiment?s heritage, the physical size/mass and power/data/other requirements of the experiment, any requirements on the suborbital flight environment, the expected cost of preparing this experiment for flight and completing post-flight data analysis, the expected number of flights necessary to complete the investigation, whether the experiment team intends to fly their own qualified team member or to have NASA supply a flight scientist, and any other information that might be helpful to NASA in acquiring commercial suborbital services and planning a pilot research program. Instructions: All responses submitted in response to this RFI must be submitted in electronic form via NSPIRES, the NASA online announcement data management system, located at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/   .  For this RFI, a response submission will take the form of a Notice of Intent (NOI) within the NSPIRES online announcement data management system.  The RFI response itself will be a PDF-formatted document that is attached (uploaded) to the NSPIRES system. You must be registered with NSPIRES to submit a RFI response.  See registration instructions at http://nspires.nasaprs.com   (select ?Getting an account?).  Neither institution registration nor an institution affiliation is required to respond to this RFI. 1.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Applied Biosystems, 850 Lincoln Centre Drive, Foster City, CA 94404-1128, for customized TLDA cards. Acute respiratory infections are among the most common causes of human disease, and newly emerging respiratory pathogens, like SARS coronavirus and avian influenza, pose the added risk of pandemic outbreaks. A wide spectrum of microorganisms (primarily viruses and bacteria) can cause respiratory illness and clinical presentation is often of little diagnostic value. Consequently, there is a great need for improved diagnostic assays; however, conventional methods such as culture, antigen detection or serology may lack speed, sensitivity or availability for concurrent detection of multiple microbes. TaqMan Low Density Array (TLDA) cards provide a novel application of the TaqMan real-time PCR assay in a non-multiplexed format capable of rapid, simultaneous testing of multiple clinical specimens for up to 21 respiratory pathogens plus controls.  Applied Biosystems will provide a format 24 TLDA, with assays designed, synthesized and formulated by the customer. Applied Biosystems services will provide spotting up to 23 CDC-provided assays on blank standard 384-well TaqMan Array cards (TLDA) at card locations specified by CDC, with one 18S or GAPDH calibration assay specified by CDC per port; one IPC furnished to CDC under a Material Transfer Agreement effective as of October 1, 2007; and delivering spotted cards to CDC under mutually agreed schedule. CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.

<SUBJECT>25 -- Controlled Preparation of Platinum Nanostructures Using Photocatalytic Methods
<DESC>The high cost and limited supply of platinum demands its efficient commercial usage, a problem which can be addressed by the manipulation of the size and shape of platinum materials at the nanoscale.  Patents and patents pending describe the growth of platinum and palladium nanostructures using various templates and supports, including various surfactant assemblies, water/oil emulsions, silica and Latex nanostructures. Control of the metal growth is achieved by the use of porphyrin-based photocatalysts to reduce platinum complexes using UV-visible light and thereby forming platinum nanoparticle seeds from which the Pt and Pd nanostructures grow. Various platinum nanostructures with size and shape control can be produced, including globular nanodendrites, flat dendritic nanosheets, foam-like nanospheres, porous nanocages, and hollow nanospheres. These Pt and Pd nanostructures have been synthesized by associating the porphyrin photocatalysts with a series of templating structures. The porphyrin molecules are capable of rapidly reducing the aqueous metal salt into a tunable number of initial seed particles under white light irradiation. This provides nearly equal growth times for each seed leading to final products with uniform and predictable sizes. The shape control over the Pt nanostructures is realized by the usage of various templates such as surfactant micelles, multilamellar vesicles, liposomal aggregates, unilamellar liposomes, nanodroplets, bicelles, and polystyrene nanobeads. Several of these platinum nanostructures, with/without the use of photocatalysts, were shown to be active for hydrogen generation systems or for sintering-resistant electrocatalysts in fuel cells.  Nanostructured platinum materials are of particular interest in many technological applications, but especially as electrocatalysts in proton exchange membrane fuel cells and as catalysts in many reactions such as those employed in solar water-splitting devices. 
Sandia National Laboratories is seeking partnership relationships, consisting of  dual license and CRADA agreements to further enable commercialization of these platinum nanostructures. The successful partner(s) will have demonstrated ability in developing and bringing to market novel nanostructured materials such as those described herein.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Proposed addition of Biobased Cutlery to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Biobased Cutlery by the Federal Government. 
 
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:

Biobased Cutlery
7340-00-NIB-0044 (fork, wrapped, 1000 ct)
7340-00-NIB-0045 (knife, 100ct bag)
7340-00-NIB-0046 (knife, wrapped, 1000 ct)
7340-00-NIB-0047 (spoon, wrapped, 1000 ct)
7340-00-NIB-0048 (spoon, 100ct bag)
7340-00-NIB-0049 (fork ,100ct bag)
7340-00-NIB-0050 (dining set, 3pc/400 ct)


The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Southwest Supply Center, Fort Worth, TX.
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Biobased Cutlery to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Proposed addition of Power Staplers to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Power Staplers by the Federal Government. 
 
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:

Power Staplers
7520-00-NIB-1916 (20 sheet capacity)
7520-00-NIB-1917 (60 sheet capacity)
7520-00-NIB-1992 (15 sheet capacity)
7520-00-NIB-1993 (25 sheet capacity)

The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY.
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Power Staplers to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:

Accentra Models					Swingline Models
ACI 1100		ACI 1118			SWI 87860
ACI 1107		ACI 1507			SWI 87861
ACI 1108		ACI 1508			SWI 87850
ACI 1122		ACI 1510			SWI 87851
ACI 1123		ACI 1511
ACI 1124		ACI 1512
ACI 1110		ACI 1513
ACI 1117		ACI 1200

	
In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing Power Staplers to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 27, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Ms. Connie Mehr at (703) 603-2116.

<SUBJECT>Request For Information (RFI) No. DE-RI52-08NA28733
<DESC>Program Manager:  Parrish Staples, Reactor Conversions Program Manager, Global Threat Reduction Initiative NA-21, US DOE National Nuclear Security Administration Information Requested:  Interest and Capability to produce very high density low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel for use in high performance research and test reactors.  The request is under the Fuel Fabrication Capability (FFC) Project for the Office of the U.S. Department of Energys National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Global Threat Reduction Initiative (NNSA NA-21 Office). Purpose:  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to identify options and capabilities within the nuclear sector that contribute to production-level fabrication of very-high density, low enriched uranium (LEU) research reactor fuel.  This fuel is needed to support the reactor conversion mission of the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) for the minimization of highly enriched uranium (HEU) in civilian applications. Description:  The GTRI Reactor Conversion mission statement is to support the minimization and, to the extent possible, elimination of the use of HEU in civil nuclear applications.  This is accomplished by working to convert research and test reactors and radioisotope production processes to the use of LEU fuel/LEU targets throughout the world.  The GTRI Reactor Conversion Program, formerly known as the Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors (RERTR) Program, is one of GTRIs three main technical pillars. The GTRI Reactor Conversion Program was initially formed in 1978 by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to develop the technical means for the conversion of research reactors from weapons-grade HEU to LEU.  The Program accomplishes this goal (1) by developing LEU fuels and targets necessary for conversion, (2) assisting operators in the conversion of existing research reactors and isotope production processes by helping prepare the regulatory approval for conversion while maintaining both the reactor performance and ability to achieve the facilitys mission. The GTRI initiative was announced in May 2004 by Former Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham. Under GTRI, the U.S. DOE has established goals for the conversion of HEU-fueled research reactors. The goal includes the conversion of 129 research and test reactors to the use of LEU fuel by 2018, and to have those reactors that can convert with currently available LEU fuel or with LEU fuel currently under development in the GTRI Reactor Conversion program converted to such LEU fuels by 2014. The GTRI Conversion program is developing very high density fuel based on a Uranium-Molybdenum (U-Mo) alloy that, in foil form, can reach densities of up to 16 g/cc U.  Among the reactors targeted for conversion with this fuel are six US high-performance (HP) research reactors, all using fuel assemblies based on plate-type fuels.  These six reactors are committed to using this new LEU fuel to convert, provided that the fuel meets the reactor requirements for performance and does not significantly impact reactor operational capabilities.  These six reactors include the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the Advanced Test Reactor and associated critical facility (ATR, ATR-C) at Idaho National Laboratory (INL), the National Bureau of Standards Reactor (NBSR) research reactor at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR) at the University of MissouriColumbia, and the MITR-II reactor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The capability to fabricate this new fuel and thus enable the conversion of these 6 US HP Reactors does not currently exist.  As a result, NNSA is seeking (through issuance of this RFI) to identify commercially available options and capabilities to assist in the establishment of this capability. Although this request is focused on providing fabrication capability needed to supply the 6 US HP reactors identified above, it must be recognized that the potential exists for the use of the fabrication capability to supply additional reactors.  Up to 5 HP reactors in Western Europe, with plate-based assemblies could also use the U-Mo fuel for conversion.  Moreover, reactors currently operating with lower density LEU silicide plate-type fuel may be interested in switching to higher density U-Mo fuel if it is deemed advantageous for fuel lifecycle management. Very High-Density LEU Fuel: The six US reactors identified for conversion currently utilize traditional cermet dispersion-type fuels characterized by a finely dispersed fuel phase (U3O8, UAlx, U3Si2) in an aluminum matrix.  The total uranium loading that can be achieved with this type of fuel is limited by the uranium density of the specific fuel phase and the allowable fuel phase volume fraction.  Changing the fuel phase to a U-Mo based alloy increases the uranium density by 3 to 7 times more than that achievable in existing fuel materials.  The volume fraction of fuel in the dispersion fuel meat is typically limited to a maximum of 55% by its fabrication behavior.  The metallic nature of the U-Mo fuel allows the fuel meat to be replaced by a monolithic fuel core (i.e. the matrix material is eliminated) resulting in another doubling of the uranium loading.  However, the monolithic fuel design requires the development of new fabrication techniques to generate U-Mo foils and then to bond aluminum cladding to these foils. The NNSA is leading an active fuel development program that is making rapid progress in two key areas, fuel performance and fabrication technology. Fuel performance testing is being performed to develop a detailed understanding of fuel behavior and to conduct the demonstration testing.  The result of this effort will eventually constitute the basis for NRC qualification of the fuel and for reactor operators to request licenses to operate with the fuel. Completion of this testing is expected in 2010 and NRC qualification that will enable use of the fuel in the US HP reactors is anticipated in 2011.  The development of fabrication technology is an integral component of the fuel performance testing.  Due to large differences in mechanical properties of aluminum and U-Mo, traditional compacting and rolling techniques are not adequate to fabricate the U-Mo monolithic fuel.  Processes to fabricate thin U-Mo foils by casting and rolling have been developed and will be demonstrated on a scale suitable for commercial supply. Processes to apply cladding by friction bonding and hot isostatic pressing have been demonstrated and are being refined prior to demonstration at a scale suitable for commercial implementation.  The remaining aspects of fuel assembly fabrication should remain identical to those currently in place.  It is anticipated that commercially viable fabrication techniques will be demonstrated in concert with the fuel qualification effort.  The US reactors will not be converted simultaneously and the current fuel fabrication capability must be maintained as all US reactors achieve full conversion.  This will also allow the fuel fabrication capability to be phased in gradually for each unique reactor assembly. A more extensive discussion of the anticipated facility throughput and fabrication process is provided in the Conceptual Process Description for the Manufacture of Low-Enriched Uranium-Molybdenum Fuel, INL/EXT-08-13840, Rev 0, which is available at the following web site (http://www.rertr.anl.gov). The web site also contains numerous background papers on the fuel development and performance which can be found under the annual RERTR International Meeting Proceedings.  Papers on the studies to convert the U.S. HP reactors are also found in the last three RERTR International Meetings and can be consulted to gain a better understanding of the fuel assembly designs for these reactors. Request for Information on Fabrication Capability: NNSA is requesting that interested parties provide the following information to assist in determining the most economical and effective approaches to meeting the LEU U-Mo monolithic fuel production necessary to support the HPR conversions and continued operations.  Please provide information in the following areas: Fuel Fabrication Experience 1. Summarize your experience fabricating fuel and/or handling nuclear material.  Response should include the type of fuel fabricated, relevant fabrication processes applied, type of nuclear material handled, etc. 2. Describe any special expertise or capabilities you have that may contribute to the successful production of LEU U-Mo fuel within the 2014 timeline projected for the program to accomplish the mission? 3. Are you currently NQA1 certified to fabricate nuclear fuels? Facility Licensing 1. Do you currently operate any NRC licensed facilities?  If so, please list. 2. Would fabricating the LEU U-Mo fuel at your site require a new NRC license or a revision to an existing one? 3. Describe your experience related to Safeguards and Security of fissile materials, including Material Control and Accountability requirements. Production Considerations 1. Which of the proposed fuel fabrication capability business models listed below would you consider participating in?  Are there alternate business models you would propose?  Include the proposed location for the fuel fabrication capability in the business model response.  Also, please describe the pricing model you would employ to recoup capital and operation costs for each business model of interest. a. The technical knowledge needed to implement the fabrication technology developed for monolithic U-Mo fuel is provided by the GTRI Reactor Conversion program.  The fabrication capability owner (fuel supplier) would provide a facility and the equipment necessary to fabricate the required HP Research Reactors fuel.  The GTRI Fuel Development program would work with the fuel supplier to transfer the relevant fabrication technology (developed by the program) to the fuel supplier.  The document entitled Conceptual Process Description For The Manufacture Of Low-Enriched Uranium-Molybdenum Fuel provides a brief reference description of the fabrication process and technologies, and is located the File Attachments section below. b. The technical knowledge needed to implement the fabrication technology developed for monolithic U-Mo fuel and the equipment necessary to fabricate the fuel is provided by the GTRI Reactor Conversion program.  As in business model a., the GTRI Fuel Development program will transfer the relevant technology necessary to fabricate the fuel to the fuel supplier.  The program will also populate a facility provided by the fuel supplier with the equipment necessary to fabricate the fuel. c. The GTRI Reactor Conversion program supplies the technical knowledge needed to implement the fabrication technology, the fabrication equipment, and the fabrication facility necessary to fabricate monolithic U-Mo fuel.  All fabrication technology and capital will be provided by the GTRI program and the fuel supplier would operate the facility on DOEs behalf. Responses may include mixed business models for different aspects of fuel fabrication (i.e. foil fabrication, plate assembly, element assembly, etc.). Responses may also include business models which address only that capacity of fuel fabrication capability desired for participation (i.e. foil fabrication supply only, or to receive foils and fabricate plates and elements only, etc.). 2. Other considerations and comments. RFI Response Submission Instructions: Disclaimer:  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  In accordance with FAR 15.201 (e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI and responses to this RFI will not be returned. The purpose of this RFI is solely to solicit input for NNSA consideration in determining the most beneficial and efficient way for allowing the US to meet its commitment of conversion of all civilian research reactors to LEU fuel by 2014 for which LEU fuel exists or is currently under development. Responses to this RFI should be prepared in MS Word or PDF format, and e-mailed to Parrish Staples, NNSA Reactor Conversions Program Manager, parrish.stables@nnsa.doe.gov by Tuesday, April 15, 2008. The Department thanks you for your assistance and input.

<SUBJECT>D -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY UTags Long Range Ultrawide Band Passive Radio Frequency Identification Tags
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
UTags--Long Range Ultrawide Band Passive Radio Frequency Identification Tags

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license for commercialization its Long Range Ultrawide Band (UWB) Passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Tags, or ?UTags?, for low-cost, on-demand inventory and location of  high-value assets.

Background:. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology uses radio signals to identify and track objects.  The objects being tracked can have active (battery-powered) or passive (unpowered) tags.  For high-value assets conventional RFID uses battery-powered tags.  These tags have a range of approximately 10 meters depending on the power levels, but have the disadvantage of being bulky in size and of periodic battery replacements.  Unpowered tags usually have a range of approximately 2 meters.

Description:  LLNL?s technology does not use battery-powered tags.  Rather it uses a tag technology that has the same range characteristics of battery-powered tags (~10 m) but without the conventional battery. Go to: https://ipo.llnl.gov/technology/profile/announcement/passiveradio.php to view a graphic design of the Utag.

Advantages:  

?	No conventional batteries ?? no periodic replacements ?? no human intervention ??Lower operating costs
?	Passive, remotely powered ?? unlimited lifetime ?? Lower operating costs
?	Longer range than conventional passive tags ?? More flexibility 
?	Built by conventional electronic methods ?? Lower manufacturing costs 
?	Uses UWB technology ?? less interference in harsh environments ?? Better performance

Potential Applications: 

?	Asset management systems
?	Inventory control systems
	
Development Status:

Prototypes are being built.  Integration into customer-specific application will be devoted to antenna design, signal processing improvements, and system testing. A U.S. Patent Application has been filed.  More invention disclosures are being developed.
 
LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPO website at http://ipo.llnl.gov/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process. 

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's UTags-Long Range Ultrawide Band (UWB) Passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Tags technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) OR Request for Quotations (RFQ)] for STATEMENT OF WORK FOR CONFIGURATION SUPPORT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM  DISASTER MONITORING CONSTELLATION (UK-DMC) SATELLITE INTRODUCTION  NASA Glenn Research Center is performing research regarding advanced space-based sensor web, delay/disruption tolerant networking (DTN) protocol development and bundling agent discover.  In all cases, the efforts require access to IP compliant space-based assets using multiple ground stations.  Furthermore, the nature of the system development requires secure autonomous machine-to-machine scheduling of such assets.   To support the three inter-related research efforts, NASAs Earth/Sun Science Technology Office (ESTO) is funding NASA Glenn Research Center for development of autonomous, automated service agreements between the secure autonomous intelligent controller and ground systems.  These autonomous, automated service agreements will enable NASA to obtain near real-time access to space-based assets  in this case the Cisco router in Low Earth Orbit (CLEO) onboard the Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) United Kingdom - Disaster Monitoring Constellation satellite (UK-DMC).   NASA is currently using General Dynamics virtual mission operations center (VMOC) as the intelligent controller thereby leveraging millions of dollars of DoDs and General Dynamics investments.	NASA also has a Space Act Agreement (SAA) with Cisco to perform joint space-based Internet research and has been allowed to use CLEO for this effort via that SAA.   In addition, NASA has a contract for ground station support with Universal Space Networks (USN).	Both General Dynamics and USN have established working relationships with SSTL and Cisco and understand that the UK-DMC is an operational, money-making system with a Cisco experimental payload onboard.	General Dynamics also has knowledge and understanding of operations of the UK-DMC commanding and of SSTLs business operations and practices.    Furthermore, SSTL and General Dynamics have already been working to develop some automated machine-to-machine communications between the VMOC and SSTLs Mission Planning System (MPS).	 PURPOSE NASA wishes to obtain spacecraft configuration and experimentation support service for the Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) Satellites and in particular, the United Kingdom (UK) DMC.    TASK 1  DEVELOPMENT OF 38.4 KBPS PASS THROUGH FIRMWARE NASA is performing joint research with the US Army Space and Missile Defense Battle Lab (SMDB).  SMDB possess a ground station capable of communicating with the UK-DMC.  The gain of the current phased array antenna cannot provide a quality downlink at 8 Mbps.  However, it can close link at 38.4 kbps.   SSTL has developed software for CLEO that supports an 8 Mbps downlink and 9.6 kbps uplink.    The contractor shall develop software and firmware to support 9.6 kbps uplink and 38.4 kbps downlink with access to CLEO. This work is required within the first 3 months of the start of the contract. TASK 2  CONFIGURATION OF UK-DMC FOR EXPERIMENTAL PASSES NASA is performing research using the UK-DMC.  For this research, multiple ground stations are to be used include: SSTL Ground Station in Guildford, England National Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Japan (NICT) Multi-User Ground Station in Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA; Universal Space Network ground stations in Alaska, Hawaii, and Australia. In order to send or receive data to the UK-DMC via any station, SSTL must configure the UK-DMC to transmit or receive as well as configure for which rates to transmit.  Furthermore, in order to access the Cisco router, SSTL must configure on SSDR to be in pass-through mode and this mode must conform to the desired frequency.	 The contractor shall configure the spacecraft for the appropriate configuration requested for each satellite pass.  Configurations shall be for: 1)  Receive only telemetry at 38.4 kbps downlink 2)  Low rate receive and transmit to the Onboard Processor 3)  Low rate receive and transmit to the Cisco router (CLEO) 4)  High-rate image passes via the SSDR 5)  High-rate image passes via the Cisco Route This work is an ongoing requirement for the extent of the contract.   TASK 3  GROUND STATION CONFIGURATION SUPPORT FOR IPV6 AND DELAY/DISRUPTION TOLERANT NETWORKING NASA is performing IPv6 and Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking research using CLEO or the Solid State Data Recorders (SSDRs) onboard the UK-DMC.  In order to support this effort using the SSTL ground station, the ground infrastructure must be upgraded or enhanced. The contractor shall work with NASA GRC to enhance the SSTL ground terminal infrastructure as follows: 1)	Add IPv6 and IPsec capability to the ground router 2)	Modify the existing ground router to: a.	Enable IPv4 mobile-ip; b.	Enable IPv4 static routing; c.	Add IPv6-to-IPv4 tunnels between the NASA Home Agent Router and the SSTL ground router; d.	Enable IPv6 Static Routing between the SSTL ground router and CLEO; and, e.	Enable IPv4 IPsec tunnels between the SSTL ground router and CLEO. 3)	Add DTN bundle forwarding agent capability to the SSTL ground infrastructure. This work is required within the first 9 months of the start of the contract. TASK 4  UPLOAD OF SOLID STATE DATA RECORDER IMAGES OR PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT EXPERIMENTATION NASA is performing advanced protocol networking research using the Solid State Data Recorders (SSDRs) onboard the UK-DMC.  In order to support this effort, new protocol images must upload to the SSTL SSDR. Once protocols have been tested in the NASA GRC UK-DMC engineering testbed and confirmed to operate properly, the contract shall schedule the UK-DMC for protocol testing and upload the image.   The following protocols shall be supported: 1)	Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking, a application layer store and forward protocol; and  2)	Seamless IP-diversity-based Generalized Mobility Architecture (SIGMA), a transport-layer mobility protocol. This work is an ongoing requirement for the extent of the contract.   TASK 5  SUPPORT FOR SECURE AUTOMATION AND SCHEDULING OF DMC ASSETS BY AN INTELLIGENT CONTROLLER NASA Glenn Research Center is performing research regarding advanced space-based sensor web. NASA is currently using General Dynamics virtual mission operations center (VMOC) as the intelligent controller.	To support near-real-time access to space, NASA is developing a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that requires machine-to-machine automated scheduling.

These meters will communicate with the current Automated Meter Reading System and Server. This capability is a requirement of the Energy Policy Act 2005.

Itron Sentinel Meter model # SS4S1D pulse electric meter with KYZ Boards is compatible with the existing meters at Randolph AFB. The meter pulse output can communicate automatically with a ModHopper which in turn sends a signal to a server for meter reading. Other companies have pulse meters, however they would not be compatible, in communication, to the fixed network.

Statement of Work
1.0  Scope and Purpose

1.1	The FDA Biosciences Library requires access to DialogClassic and DialogSelect through a combined procurement. While both products provide access to similar databases, DialogSelect is needed for our customers and DialogClassic is used by information professionals (librarians). Library staff require a command driven interface which provides enhanced functionality ( i.e Boolean logic and command language),  to extensive content. With this, experienced searchers are able to conduct precise searches providing a more comprehensive and customized results set needed for regulatory review. DialogSelect offers a user-friendly end-user interface for FDA customers. Customers do not need to be proficient in using command language to conduct a simple, effective search.  This resources provides quicker retrieval that is not as comprehensive as the results set in a DialogClassic search. Customers are also able to set-up customized alerts to receive content based on their topic of interest, frequency and format. 

1.2	This is a combined procurement as stated above.

1.3	The online platform must allow quick searches with 24/7 access for Agency staff reducing the need for multiple individual print copies of resources provided. 

2.0	Specific Requirements

2.1  The FDA requires online access to two products  for reasons stated above ? DialogSelect and DialogClassic.  Each platform provides cross searching across multiple database files.

Dialog Classic offers the most comprehensive suite of online search tools. It includes access to INSPEC, a premier database for physics, electronics and computing. 

DialogSelect combines Dialog's database collection and precision searching with the accessibility of the Web.  Contains 50,000 of the most objective and respected publications and documents available online. 
Features include:
o	Vertical Approach to Information
Direct access to vertical applications targeted towards your search needs.
o	Powerful Search Engine
You get the most reputable, complete online information without needing to know which sources to search or how to search them. No training is necessary.
o	Multiple Search Options
Search by keyword, title, author, journal name, company name, year, date, and more to get exactly the information you need, from the sources you need. 
o	Automatic Alerts (member access only)
Effortlessly monitor new activities on topics of your choice with DialogSelect Alerts. The latest data available online is automatically delivered to your email box.


Selected databases based on customer feedback and Agency needs include:

Incidence and Prevalence Database, Thomas Register,  Foodline, AGRIS, NTIS, TechInfoSource, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology Abstracts, US Patents Full-text, Dialog Newsroom, Encyclopedia of Associations, Foundation Directory, Research Centers and Services Directory, Consumer Reports, MathSci, Agency and Advertisers Redbook,  and Business and Industry.


2.2 	For the above list, the contractor shall provide the following:

a.  A site license for 24/7 desktop web access, via IP, for the Agency. DialogClassic is setup with password access and DialogSelect requires customers to login with Center and name.
b.  Customer Support service shall be available to troubleshoot website/connectivity issues via phone, email, etc. 24 hours a day every business day. A Knowledge Center with searching professionals is available offering consultants providing search assistance as needed,
	--  Any connectivity problems or access problems experienced by the Library shall be resolved within 24 hrs. from the time the problem is first reported to the vendor.
c.  Librarians require access to all of the resources and must be able to search selected resources with one query and one interface to customize search results for regulatory review.  
d.  Customers require a single access interface to search across a variety of selected resources to conduct quick searches

            
3.0  Description of Work

3.1  
Ideally, the FDA Biosciences Library requires two resources ? DialogClassic and DialogSelect.

	DialogClassic allows our library professionals to search across some nine hundred databases with one query to gain information to create the customized comprehensive results packages required for regulatory review.

	DialogSelect offers customers an easy to use interface to conduct a quick search with a less comprehensive results package.

The contractor shall provide paperwork, called a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), regarding the 508 Compliance status of the product(s) at the same time the bid is offered. For more information about 508 Compliance, please visit the following site:
http://508.hhs.gov/vendors.htm

The below links will provide overview and assistance to what is needed. A service still must be 508 compliant. 

The purpose of this part is to implement section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d). Section 508 requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. 

So if federal employees or the public will use EIT that we procure, or develop, then it has to be accessible.  Technical standards that apply to web-based resources are provided below:

(f) Client-side image maps shall be provided instead of server-side image maps except where the regions cannot be defined with an available geometric shape. 
(g) Row and column headers shall be identified for data tables. 
(h) Markup shall be used to associate data cells and header cells for data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers.

(l) When pages utilize scripting languages to display content, or to create interface elements, the information provided by the script shall be identified with functional text that can be read by assistive technology. 
(m) When a web page requires that an applet, plug-in or other application be present on the client system to interpret page content, the page must provide a link to a plug-in or applet that complies with ?1194.21(a) through (l). 
(n) When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Anticipated award date is no later than 13 March 2008. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 12 March 2008.  PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION.  Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the Attention of: Tracey Burgess at 252-335-6790.  Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the nomenclature; part number; unit price and extended price, FOB point; payment terms and any discount offered for prompt payment, the business size standard and any minority classification; delivery date, and Representation and Certifications contained in FAR Clause 52.212-3, including Alternate I.

1.0	BACKGROUND
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty-one (21) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are operated differently from those in general aviation; Coast Guard missions require frequent operation within salt-laden environments, and conditions, which accelerate the corrosive attack on the airframe structures and components of the HU-25 aircraft.  Inspection of these aircraft in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacturer??s (OEM) periodic requirements under the U.S. Coast Guard's specialized Aircraft Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS), historically reveals corrosion damage and operational wear and tear associated with aging aircraft, which is often outside the scope of OEM published repair limits and specifications.  During these inspections Horizontal Stabilizers S/N 411 and 404 were found unserviceable.  These stabilizers were evaluated and recommended for repair by Dassault Falcon (DFJ) Structural Engineers on 11 April 2007.  
This statement of work describes the inspection, damage evaluation, repair plan proposal and services necessary to return horizontal stabilizers S/Ns 411 & 404, their structures, and components as used on the U.S. Coast Guard HU-25 aircraft in an airworthy condition per DFJ Report Number DFJ-823-6147 and Power Point Inspection of Horizontal Stabilizers.  The horizontal stabilizers shall be painted to match the Coast Guard??s current colors and paint scheme in accordance with (IAW) ARSC Paint Drawing 925-139, and be delivered in a ready for installation condition.  All work shall be performed IAW Dassault Falcon Jet drawings specifications.  
This Statement of Work addresses DFJ??s findings and recommendations for returning each stabilizer to an airworthy condition.  However, it is recognized that during the repair process circumstances outside of the proposed scope of work may arise which could not be anticipated.  For such instances, direct communication with the Coast Guard??s Aircraft Repair and supply Center (ARSC), HU-25 Engineering Cell will be required.  These communications shall be for the purpose of clarification only and shall not be construed by the contractor as authorization for an increase in the scope of work being performed.  In the event the discussions result in need for a change, the contractor shall not perform additional work until so authorized by written modification which has been signed by an authorized Coast Guard contracting officer.  Work performed without written modification may result in unpaid performance on the part of the contractor. The ARSC HU25 Engineering Officer may be reached at (252-335-6887), or you may contact the ARSC HU25 Maintenance Officer at (252-335-6310) for any relevant questions or comments.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

  Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the Government Accountability Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity's Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.
 (End of provision)
DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel ( see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.
( End of provision )

All Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database to receive an award.  Information on registering may be obtained by calling 1-888-227-2423 or by the internet web page http://www.ccr.gov/.

All responsible business concerns may submit a quotation that shall be considered by this agency.  In order to be eligible for award, a Contractor must be determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104.

Evaluation of Quote:

OPTION FOR INCREASED QUANTITY

To accommodate potential increases in requirements under the resultant contract, the Government may increase the supply called herein by up to, but not exceeding 10 units. The Contracting Officer may exercise quantity, or a portion thereof, at any time, or from time to time within the timeframe indicated in Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 0002 of the contract.

Quotation Requirements

Contractors are required to submit their quotes in two separate parts as follows:

Part I Technical Information
This part shall contain Product (Technical) Literature information. The offeror(s) shall submit their product literature showing all the specifications for the proposed portable eavesdropping protection pack. The technical literature will be reviewed first to make sure the offeror(s) can meet the minimum requirements. 

Part II Evaluation Factors
52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement. While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of quotes, the final contract award will be based on a combination of factors - a combination of price and past performance. Quoters are encouraged to submit items on varying points above the 25 minimum and multiple quotes from each offeror will be considered and evaluated. The items that offer the most economical combination of price and points will be used in this combination of price/past performance best value determination.  

The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter?s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.

Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/ .

METHOD OF PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:  The NECO website has a "submit bid" button next to the solicitation number.  DO NOT use the "submit bid" button on NECO to submit your quote.   

All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, business size, and payment terms. Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

<DESC>1.  Amendment 01 is hereby incorporated into Request for Proposal (RFP) number SP3100-08-R-0017 and shall become a part of any resultant contract.

2.  The following are responses to contractor submitted questions:

Question 1:  Clin 0001 Yale esc040fa you show dimensions of 38L X 13W X 31H Yale shows 38L X 20.8W X 30.5H -- so width appears wrong Also you can put in an 18 125 17 w/ 1000 amp hours or 18 125 13 w/ 750 amp hours in the Yale erc040fa - which do you want? both meet the 620 AH minimum but the price is different.
Answer 1:  The 38L X 20.8W X 30.5H is correct. I am not sure where the other value came from.  The requirement is 620 AH minimum.

Question 2:  Clin 0002 12-85- 15  has 595 amp hours--you ask for 750 amp hours rating--amp hours is wrong or battery is wrong.  Also, on part number - Desert Hog is a brand---12-85-15 is type or part number. We provide a Douglas legacy 12-85-15.
Answer 2:  Yale stock selector is correct. 750 AH was a mistake, it should be 550 AH minimum rating.

Question 3:  Clin 0003  Yale erc040ag--36 X 26 X 22 H  980 amp hours To fit (and Yale shows) 18 85 17 battery w/ 680 amp hours rating The 980 Amp hours must be wrong.
Answer 3:  The battery is a 18-85-19.

3.  The closing date for submission of offers will remain as MARCH 5, 2008, 3:30 PM EST.

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Past performance will be required with a maximum of three references from contracts similar in scope.  Each reference needs to include names, phone numbers and email addresses.  The technical proposal will be evaluated separately from the price proposal.  For this contract, past performance, when compared with technical merit will be valued higher than price.  The Government will perform a best value analysis considering technical merit and past performance before price to find a suitable contractor.

Method of Award - Cascade Set-Aside Procedure
Any award resulting from this solicitation will be made using the following cascade set-aside order of precedence:
1.1  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.1405, any award under this solicitation will be made on a competitive basis first to an eligible Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concern provided that there is adequate competition among such firms. (see FAR 52.219-1, "Small Business Program Representations" for small business size definition.)
1.2 If there is inadequate competition for award to a SDVOSB concern, award will be made competitively in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.502-2, Total Small Business set-asides.
2. Adequate competition shall be deemed to exist if-
2.1  At least two competitive offers are received from qualified, responsible business concerns at the tier under consideration; and
2.2  Award will be made at fair market prices as determined in accordance with FAR 19.202-6.
3. When there is inadequate competition at the SDVOSB tier, an otherwise competitive offer from a responsible business concern at that tier will be considered with the eligible offers for the next lower tier which it is eligible.  For example, only one competitive offer is received from a SDVOSB business.  That offer will be included with the offer(s) received from a small businesses.
4. Pricing will be firm fixed price for each line item identified.  After receipt of proposals, a determination shall be made of which proposal(s) are in the competitive range for the purpose of conducting written and/or oral discussions, if necessary.  Offerors should note that award may be made on the initial proposal.  The offeror(s) with the lowest cost/price alone will not necessarily be awarded the contract.

3.  52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items (SEP 2006)

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to RFP questions submitted to the Government.

Q1.  Provide utilization statistics for the last 2-3 fiscal years, including the number of pre-placement exams, annual physical fitness screenings, medical surveillance exams and fitness for duty exams that were performed.
	
A1.  The IRS does not track this type of information.

Q2.  Provide locations where services have been/will need to be provided, including the number of exams per location. 
	
A2.  There are approximately three thousand Special Agents nationwide. See below for a list of all POD locations. Each agent must have an annual physical fitness program (PFP) clearance examination, audiogram and blood lead test. Pre-placement examinations cannot be predicted since applicants are from all over the country. 

Q3.  Who is the incumbent contractor?

A3.  The incumbent contractor is Comprehensive Health Services (CHS) of Cape Canaveral, FL.  The IRS in the past utilized CHS?s services through interagency agreement with FedSource.  FedSource is no longer able to service this requirement.  CHS currently holds a bridge contract through May 31, 2008.

Q4.  What is the value of the current contract?

A4.  The current contract is issued on a labor hours basis.  The government will not release the current value as part of this solicitation process.

Q5.  Have the requirements changed under the new solicitation?

A5.  Minor changes have been made under the new solicitation.

Q6.  What are the locations of IRS officers and number of exams needed at each location?

A6.  See answer to question number 1.

Q7.  Could you please clarify the details of the work location requirements?
	
A7.  The contractor is to identify an acceptable clinic that can conduct all the requirements of the requested exam type (e.g., pre-placement, physical fitness program, OSHA audiogram, blood lead testing, etc.).  The clinic should be no further than 40 miles from the agent?s field office.

Q8.  Approximately how many IRS designated personnel will be using the password-protected secure webpage? 
	
A8.  We currently have 50 designated individuals with access to the password protected secure webpage, however; we expect this number to increase to approximately 75 -100.  The access is limited to each individuals work requirements and ?need to know? of specific information (e.g., PFP Coordinators only have access to physical fitness clearance data, etc.) 

Q9.  How will the ?hot list? be provided?   In what format and at what frequency?

A9.  The ?hot list? will be provided in an excel spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet will be sent by email to the Cincinnati Employment Branch (CEB) in a secured zip file every Friday by 12:00 EST.  
	
Q10.  Section 4.3 paragraph 7 refers to a 10-day notice of incomplete information sent to applicants and agents. Will the Contractor or IRS send this notice?

A10.  The contractor will notify the IRS of the applicants and/or agents that do not provide the requested information in the designated timeframe.  The IRS will then follow-up with the applicants and agents.

Q11.  Historically, how many agents have opted to see their personal physicians instead of participating in the program as referred to in section 4.5?

A11.  Last year, only 30 agents had their PFP evaluations conducted by their own physician.

Q12.	A price form was not provided; what format would you prefer the cost be submitted?

A12.  As stated in the solicitation, the contractor may utilize either a labor hours or time and materials type contract.  This acquisition is being conducted using FAR Part 12, Commercial Item Acquisition procedures.  Firms should submit their price proposals in the structure typically used in the commercial marketplace.

Q13.  In the past, about how many hours are billed for these exams?  Usually this type of work is billed on a fixed unit price basis.

A13.  The IRS does not track this type of information.

Q14.  What are the locations where exams are needed, and what is the estimated volume of exams in each location?

A14.  See answer to question number 1.

Q15.  Is there an incumbent provider for this contract?  If so, who?

A15.  See the answer to question 3.

Q16.  The RFP mentioned that medical records will be provided to the Contractor.  Are these records electronic or hard copy files?

A16.  The medical records are available in both electronic and hard copy files.

Q17.  Section 4.1 states that the Contractor will schedule examination/screening appointments via a secure website which designated personnel can track.  Can you explain your expectations for exam scheduling further?

A17.  The Cincinnati Employment Branch (CEB) will provide the contractor with a list of names and locations of the selected candidates.  The contractor will identify a clinic close to the candidate?s home and then contact the candidate with a tentative appointment.  All attempts to contact the candidate and the confirmed appointment will be posted in the secure website as ?need to know? information for the CEB personnel.

Q18.  It would be helpful if you could provide clarification as to whether there is an incumbent contractor currently performing these services along with their name and current hourly bill rates.  Are there incumbent healthcare workers eligible to transition to the follow-on contract?

A18.  See the answer to questions 3 and 4.  There are no incumbent healthcare workers eligible to transition to the follow-on contract.

Q19.  Is this a new requirement?  If it is not, who is the incumbent and what is the current contract value?  Can we have a copy of the Statement of Work.

A19.  See the answer to questions 3 and 4.

<DESC>Amendment is to post Questions and Answers and to delete the noted section from the solicitation as stated in Questions 3 and 9. Maps provided upon request.<BR><BR>1.	Why is this requirement not set aside for a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Bu siness (SDVet Business)?    In reference to this and previous requests to sole source this requirement to a service disabled veteran owned business or restrict competition to only businesses identified as service disabled veteran owned businesses concern a  market survey was conducted in accordance with FAR 19.1405.  To set-aside an acquisition for competition restricted to SDVet Business concerns, the contracting officer must have a reasonable expectation that offers will be received from two or more servic e-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns; and award will be made at a fair market price.  The results of the market survey showed that there insufficient competition within the Service Disabled Veteran Owned business set-aside; specifically the res ults revealed only one business within this set-aside was likely to provide an offer.  There were similar results for all of the other social economic set-asides.  Given the magnitude and flexibility of this requirement receipt of competitive proposals is the best method for obtaining successful performance at reasonable price.  Markey survey results show that there is sufficient competition for this requirement within small business.<BR><BR>2.	The Solicitation does not state the precise locations for place ment of units.  Can you provide Military Grid Locations or Mile ranges from main post for each of the Line Items?  A map is submitted in identifying location proximity of actual need and the purpose of proposing.  Grid locations will be provided per call.< BR><BR>3.	The solicitation states, The prices to the government shall be as low as or lower than those charged the suppliers most favored customer for comparable quantities under similar terms and conditions&.  Your current contractor, Vantex Service Co rporation, currently charges Ft Drum $0.01 per service, base wide.  Does this mean he has to charge Ft Irwin $0.01 per service also since Ft Drum in this case would be his most favored customer? This requirement is deleted from the solicitation..<BR><BR>4. 	At the conclusion of performance of a Delivery Order, will the contractor be required to return the units that were used in the performance of the delivery order to the yard or can they be left in place?  The contractor shall remove latrines from training  locations or support areas within forty-eight (48) hours after performance period has ended and return them to the Yard.<BR><BR>5.	The solicitation states, Latrines will have holes in the walls, Chemical Leaks,&  I am not sure that we have any units tha t have chemical leaks or holes in the walls.  Is this a misprint? Yes,  this was a misprint.  Thanks for bringing this to our attention.  The sentence should have read, Latrines will have no holes in the walls or doors, no chemical leaks, hinges and latch es shall operate as intended in original design.  Each latrine shall be completely enclosed with roof ventilation to release odors.  <BR><BR>6.	The solicitation states Latrine vents shall be screened to preclude the entry of insects.  Are you referring to the windows at the top of the walls or the waste tank vent pipe?  The industry standard is to screen the windows and not the vent pipe.  Yes, the reference is for the windows located at the top of the walls. <BR><BR>7.	Under the heading of Location you refer to attached maps.  There were no maps attached.  Can you please send them? A map is provided upon request in identifying location proximity of actual need and the purpose of proposing.  Grid locations will be provided per call.<BR><BR>8.	The solicita tion requires hand wash stations to be desert sand in color.  The industry standard is grey.  Since most if not all of these will be located on the FOBs is it necessary that they be sand colored or can they be grey?  Yes,  the desert sand color for the handwash station is required in keeping with the desert background.  This aids in making the training environment as realistic as possible and does not present a distraction.  <BR><BR>9.	The solicitation requires a form to be turned in at the end of each week to the COR?  Is this a new requirement or are you doing this now?  This requirement is deleted from the solicitation.<BR><BR>10.	How will you award delivery o rders under the BPA system?  Will you award to the lowest offered price on each line item, will you rotate the work, or will you try to even the dollar amount and work between the contractors?  BPA calls will be rotated among awardees.  In the event that t he awardee cannot meet the requirement in terms of delivery or quantity, the requirement will be awarded to the next awardee on the rotation cycle.<BR><BR>11.	Individual purchases under a BPA shall not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.  Since mo st rotational unit requirements are in excess of $100,000, will the Ft Irwin Contracting Office split the requirements to stay below that level or will you contract these through other means?  Under the commercial test program, of which this is being solic ited, the threshold is at $5.5 Million.  Purchases will not be split or contracted through other means.<BR><BR>12.	If there is only one BPA established to an SD Vet business, will requirements be set-a-side for SD Vet businesses under the provisions of FAR  Part 19.14 or will the contracting officer not consider a sole source award to an SD Vet business even though the FAR provides the authority and the President/ Dec of Defense, and the Secretary of the Army all support maximizing business opportunities to SD Vet businesses? Multiple BPAs will be established and requirements rotated among awardees. <BR><BR><BR>13.	Finally, why are you establishing a BPA for a requirement that will exceed one million dollars per year?  As you are aware this requirement has ex ceeded $5.5 million in the last 18 months. For the last twenty years portable toilets have been purchased on a requirements contract.  BPAs have historically been established to simplify small repetitive purchases at the micro purchase level, not to award  over $300,000 per month.  A BPA is being established as an interim contract vehicle to allow for the solicitation of a Base plus 4 Option Year IDIQ contract in order to meet the installation immediate requirements and to ensure no disruption in service to  the critical training mission of NTC and Fort Irwin.
