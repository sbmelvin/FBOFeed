<DESC>GENERAL PROJECT DESCRIPTION - AG-02RC-S-11-0039<br />This is a Total HubZone Set-aside.<br />Idaho Panhandle National Forest NORTH ZONE Road Blading &amp; Minor Road Mtnc.<br />Sandpoint, Bonners Ferry &amp; Priest Lake Ranger Districts only.
<p>Work consists primarily of road blading and some minor road maintenance such as ditch cleaning, culvert cleaning &amp; reconditioning, rock and minor slide removal.</p>
<p>This will be a multiple award Indefinite Delivery and Indefinite Quantities contract. The Government intends to target at least two and up to three awards. Task Orders will be subject to a Fair Opportunity given to each awardee except when exceptions to Fair Opportunity occur.</p>
<p>Pricing will be by the mile for common road grading in quantity groups and will not include mobilization. Mobilization pricing will be handled on a task order by task order basis. Pricing for items on the schedule of items will reflect the maximum price per mile for that quantity group. When task orders are competed, as required by the FAR 16.505 - which is called Fair Opportunity -</p>
<p>(b) Orders under multiple award contracts- <br />(1) Fair opportunity. <br />(i) The contracting officer must provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for each order exceeding $3,000 issued under multiple delivery-order contracts or multiple task-order contracts, except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section...</p>
<p>Task Orders will be subject to Fair Opportunity among the main contract's awardees (two to three) for work ordered under this contract. Task Announcements will include specific descriptions and maps for the work to be accomplished, a Schedule of Items, an estimated start date and a contract time. Task Announcements sent to each contractor on this award will serve as "mini" solicitations with a foreshortened response time and stated deadline to start work.</p>
<p>Contractor's may discount, that is lower their initial item unit prices they quoted on the main contract when competing for task order awards. Therefore, initial unit pricing for the main contract should consider this. Not too high as to be unreasonable for the main award and not too low to allow little room for discounting when competing. Mobilization&nbsp;will be&nbsp;priced on a task order basis and therefore part of the&nbsp;competitive price on each task order.<br /><br />Example Quantity Groups:</p>
<p>Road Blading price per mile if less than 20 miles on a task order. <br />Road blading priced per mile if greater than 20 miles and less than 45 miles on a task order. <br />Road grading priced per mile if over 45 miles on a task order.</p>
<p>Some limited hourly work with equipment and operator will be on the schedule of items also to be utilized per the Time Material and Labor Hour Clauses FAR 52.212-4 Alternate One.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that other minor road maintenance work may be specified and priced on a per job basis within a task order for blading. These items will be called Over and Above Items and will not be priced on the main contract but any use of the Over and Above Items cannot exceed the price of road blading on any task order. And example may be "clean 7 culverts on the XX road." Or "blade the roads in XYZ campground."</p>
<p><br />The estimated start work date on-the-ground for the project is mid May of 2011.</p>
<p><br />PROJECT LOCATION: Idaho Panhandle NF: Sandpoint RD, Bonners Ferry RD and Priest Lake RD - together referred to as the North Zone.</p>

<DESC>Mod/Amendment of Pre-Sol Notice only added Central Zone to the Title.<br /><br />GENERAL PROJECT DESCRIPTION - AG-02RC-S-11-0041<br />This is a Total HubZone Set-aside.<br />Idaho Panhandle National Forest SOUTH ZONE Road Blading &amp; Minor Road Mtnc.<br />St. Joe Ranger District only.
<p>Work consists primarily of road blading and some minor road maintenance such as ditch cleaning, culvert cleaning &amp; reconditioning, rock and minor slide removal.</p>
<p>This will be a multiple award Indefinite Delivery and Indefinite Quantities contract. The Government intends to target at least two and up to three awards. Task Orders will be subject to a Fair Opportunity given to each awardee except when exceptions to Fair Opportunity occur.</p>
<p>Pricing will be by the mile for common road grading in quantity groups and will not include mobilization. Mobilization pricing will be handled on a task order by task order basis. Pricing for items on the schedule of items will reflect the maximum price per mile for that quantity group. When task orders are competed, as required by the FAR 16.505 - which is called Fair Opportunity -</p>
<p>(b) Orders under multiple award contracts- <br />(1) Fair opportunity. <br />(i) The contracting officer must provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for each order exceeding $3,000 issued under multiple delivery-order contracts or multiple task-order contracts, except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section...</p>
<p>Task Orders will be subject to Fair Opportunity among the main contract's awardees (two to three) for work ordered under this contract. Task Announcements will include specific descriptions and maps for the work to be accomplished, a Schedule of Items, an estimated start date and a contract time. Task Announcements sent to each contractor on this award will serve as "mini" solicitations with a foreshortened response time and stated deadline to start work.</p>
<p>Contractor's may discount, that is lower their initial item unit prices they quoted on the main contract when competing for task order awards. Therefore, initial unit pricing for the main contract should consider this. Not too high as to be unreasonable for the main award and not too low to allow little room for discounting when competing. Mobilization will be priced on a task order basis and therefore part of the competitive price on each task order.</p>
<p>Example Quantity Groups:</p>
<p>Road Blading price per mile if less than 20 miles on a task order. <br />Road blading priced per mile if greater than 20 miles and less than 45 miles on a task order. <br />Road grading priced per mile if over 45 miles on a task order.</p>
<p>Some limited hourly work with equipment and operator will be on the schedule of items also to be utilized per the Time Material and Labor Hour Clauses FAR 52.212-4 Alternate One.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that other minor road maintenance work may be specified and priced on a per job basis within a task order for blading. These items will be called Over and Above Items and will not be priced on the main contract but any use of the Over and Above Items cannot exceed the price of road blading on any task order. And example may be "clean 7 culverts on the XX road." Or "blade the roads in XYZ campground."</p>
<p><br />The estimated start work date on-the-ground for the project is mid May of 2011.</p>
<p><br />PROJECT LOCATION: Idaho Panhandle NF: St. Joe Ranger District- referred to as the South Zone.</p>
<p><br />SOLICITATION INFORMATION: <br />The solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps (FBO) website on or about March 21, 2011 for viewing and printing. Since the solicitation will be under FAR part 12 Commercial Item procedures, a full fifteen day synopsis/pre-solicitation notice is not required so a shorter period will be utilized for the notice (FAR 5.203(a)(1))</p>
<p>Potential responders are requested to obtain the solicitation, including any plans/drawings from the Internet FBO site. NO HARD-COPY solicitations will be issued.</p>
<p>Quotes will be due approximately 29 calendar days after the solicitation issue date - Check the solicitation form to confirm the actual closing date subject to any amendments that may extend the solicitation. Target date for solicitation closing as of this notice is April 18, 2011.</p>
<p>AUTOMATIC NOTIFICATION: <br />By registering to receive notification on posted notices of synopses such as this, you will be automatically notified via email of the posting of the actual solicitation and any changes to the project such as amendments you may be required to acknowledge. To register, select Register to Receive Notification and follow the steps. Follow the same procedure for EACH project. Any amendments will be posted on FBO and potential quoters are required to utilize FBO to track amendments or other changes.</p>
