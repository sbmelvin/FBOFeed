<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to negotiate a contract with Brigham and Women's Hospital.
<p>This procurement is for a contract with researchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, a teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School, who will contribute towards the establishment of a new longitudinal, occupational cohort of female nurses of reproductive age, known as the Nurses' Health Study III. The purpose of this action is to secure the services of researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital to collect, analyze, and manage data from the proposed Nurses' Health Study III full study to complete the following tasks: 1) recruit 100,000 participants for the study, 2) collect occupational and reproductive health data, 3) summarize exposure and health data, 4) analyze etiologic relationships between exposures and reproductive health outcomes.</p>
<p>This study is a continuation of the NIOSH Contract Number 211-2008-M-24365.</p>
<p>Because of NIOSH's interest in studying nurses, and to leverage funds, NIOSH sought a collaboration that would help meet these goals. The Harvard Nurse's Health Studies (NHS), conducted by the Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) in Boston, is the largest study of U.S. female nurses of its kind. The NHS-I and NHS-II include two large longitudinally-followed cohorts. It has been advantageous for NIOSH to collaborate with the NHS teams to encourage them to include occupational exposure information in their questionnaires and to allow NIOSH to oversee the analyses and publication of occupationally-related data. BWH is now embarking on the establishment of a new cohort, the NHS-III, and is willing to again allow NIOSH to collaborate with them. Brigham and Women's Hospital is the only vendor with access to the Nurses' Health data and if NIOSH were to conduct such a study without BWH, the cost would be prohibitive.</p>
<p>This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to Brigham and Women's Hospital under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1). Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward product and pricing information to Florence Black, Contract Specialist, Procurement and Grant Branch-V (Pittsburgh), PO Box 18070, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA, 15236-0070; email fbb4@cdc.gov. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all product and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, negotiations will be conducted with Brigham and Women's Hospital., 75 Francis Street, OBC 3-34Q, Boston, MA 02115 as the only source.</p>

<DESC>B.2.1 OVERVIEW: At the time of issue of this Presolicitation for commercial laboratory contract providers, the Dental Service at the Coatesville VA Medical Center uses both in house and contracted (government) labs for various stages in the fabrication of oral prostheses. The Coatesville VAMC seeks to contract with a dental laboratory to provide partial and full denture services in support of a special Homeless Veterans program. Services provided need to be of high quality, efficient, and cost effective. Resin based partials or complete dentures are required. (Gold or porcelain crowns and bridges, and metal based partials will not be included in the contract).  It is estimated that these services would be required for approximately 150-200 denture cases.B.2.2 STATEMENT OF AWARD: The government intends to award a contract as a result of this solicitation, which will be posted around September 10, 2009 with a fast turnaround time.  Depending on the number of responsible, responsive offers received, and the mix of offers from both local and long distance laboratories. A local laboratory is defined as one which is close enough in proximity to the Coatesville VAMC such that pick-up and delivery of casework by a contractor representative can be routinely provided, personal face-to-face discussions can be held on occasion as needed at the VA site, or if applicable at the contractor's place of business. A long distance laboratory is defined as one which is located so far from the Coatesville VAMC that pickup and delivery of casework must be provided by means of a commercial delivery service (e.g. Federal Express, UPS, DHL), and no personal face-to-face interaction by the contractor or personal visits at the VA site or the contractor's place of business can be expected.B.2.3 STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE: The contracted laboratory shall fabricate all prostheses and perform all laboratory steps to the highest standard of quality, with special attention given to neatness and attention to laboratory prescription detail. Contractor's laboratory facility shall be American Dental Association (ADA) certified. This solicitation/contract includes regulations under the Buy American Act; VA Medical Center requires that all dental appliances supplied to the VA dental clinics are manufactured in the United States using high quality materials that meet American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. Dental laboratories must also comply with the regulations governing FDA quality system/good manufacturing practices for products distributed in the United States dental laboratories. In addition, FDA prohibits the use of lead in the surface material used to fabricate dental prosthesis. Before the contract can be awarded the winning bidder must sign A letter certifying compliance with regulations from VA Memorandum Safeguard to Prevent Use of Unapproved Materials in VA Dental Appliances dated April 17, 2000.The Government reserves the right to require "remake" at no additional cost if the casework does not conform to a high standard of quality, and the deficiency is clearly caused by the contractor.  Chief, Dental Service VAMC Coatesville will have final determination on high standard of quality, and the deficiency after consulting with the contractor.B.2.4 PICKUP & DELIVERY OF CASEWORK: Inside pick-up and delivery to the Coatesville VA Dental Service is expected. The inside point of pick-up/delivery will be specified upon award. The particular times for scheduled pickups will be determined by mutual agreement between the VA Dental Service and the Contractor. Transportation of casework shall be provided at no additional cost to the VA; therefore, unit pricing of the Complete Denture Inclusive Service (including impression trays, record bases, setup, Dentsply Classic teeth, and processing), should appropriately reflect transportation costs. Successful awardee shall either provide pickup and delivery services by car (if local) or by the use of prepaid commercial delivery service (if long distance).B.2.5. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  As this is a Commercial Item Request for Quotation (RFQ) with technical proposals and the above Schedule of Supplies/Services may not be in line with your commercial practice, you may provide alternate pricing. If you are providing an alternate pricing schedule, the Standard Form (SF) 1449, page one of the solicitation, and Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items must be completed as well as documentation for the alternate pricing. All quotes must be accompanied by a technical proposal as instructed herein.  The Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan which includes penalties will be a part of this contract.  Review this plan carefully before submitting your bids.

<p>Vendor: <br />TTAC (Tobacco Technical Assistance Consortium)<br />Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University<br />1520 Clifton Road, SON 225<br />Atlanta, GA 30322</p>
<p>Background &amp; Need<br />As the lead federal agency for comprehensive tobacco prevention and control, CDC/OSH develops, conducts, and supports strategic efforts to protect the public's health from the harmful effects of tobacco use. The goals of OSH are to prevent initiation of tobacco use among youth and young adults; promote tobacco use cessation among adults and youth; eliminate exposure to secondhand smoke; and identify and eliminate tobacco-related disparities. OSH has identified six core functions to achieve these goals:<br />1) Applied research and evaluation <br />2) Program services <br />3) Health communications <br />4) Policy and planning <br />5) Global technical assistance <br />6) Resource management</p>
<p>Central activities of OSH include provision of technical assistance and support on all six functions to NTCP tobacco control program managers and surveillance and evaluation staff in all States, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, national networks, and tribal support centers, as well as tobacco prevention and control partners.</p>
<p>The surveillance and evaluation net-conferences have been one form of technical assistance that OSH has used in the past. It is an easy way to reach a wide audience with the same message, precludes the need for travel, can be done from practically any location, and, with the archived sessions, allows constituents to view the presentations as fits their schedules. Participation rates on previous net-conferences has been high and NTCP tobacco control program managers and surveillance and evaluation staff in all States, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, national networks, and tribal support centers, as well as tobacco prevention and control partners look forward to this convenient and inexpensive way of receiving technical assistance and support to improve their programs. In these times of reduced funding, especially for travel, having an alternative method of reaching a broad audience is vital to providing technical assistance and support to OSH's constituents.</p>
<p>Return to Top<br /><br />Period of Performance: upon award to 9/30/2010</p>
<p>Purpose and Description of Work:</p>
<p>Technical Requirements</p>
<p>a) Post previous, recorded net-conferences and the associated resources onto the TTAC website.</p>
<p>b) Collaborate with CDC in planning four (4) one-hour LiveMeeting&reg; net-conferences with non-CDC speakers and, at CDC/OSH's request, up to an additional 3 net-conferences with CDC speakers.</p>
<p>c) Provide all logistical and technical support for all LiveMeeting&reg; net-conferences to NTCP tobacco control program managers and surveillance and evaluation staff in all States, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, national networks, and tribal support centers, as well as tobacco prevention and control partners and others as requested by OSH on surveillance and evaluation related topics.</p>
<p>d) Contract with speakers and pay them the speaker fees.</p>
<p>e) Be available via e-mail and/or telephone to net-conference speakers (non-CDC and CDC) and CDC staff for assistance in setting up speakers' slides and LiveMeeting&reg; for the presentations.</p>
<p>f) Be available by e-mail and/or telephone to assist participants with gaining access to posted net-conferences and to ongoing net-conferences.</p>
<p>g) Evaluate each net-conference. The evaluation will be conducted after each net conference using questions provided by OSH, either by polling immediately after the net conference, or via questionnaire following the net conference using an on-line survey website, or both. Findings will be used to improve the net-conference experience of the participants.</p>
<p>Objectives Served</p>
<p>Providing net conferences on surveillance and evaluation related topics will aid OSH in increasing tobacco use prevention and control surveillance and evaluation capacity among NTCP tobacco control program managers and surveillance and evaluation staff in all States, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, national networks, and tribal support centers, as well as tobacco prevention and control partners and others as requested by OSH. Improving surveillance and evaluation capacity of NTCP tobacco prevention and control program managers will in turn improve tobacco prevention and control programs. Net-conference topics will be partially based on participant preferences and needs.</p>
<p><br />Client Identified</p>
<p>The requested net-conference logistical support will be provided by the proposed client to the Evaluation Team of the Epidemiology Branch of OSH/NCCDPHP to increase the surveillance and evaluation capacity of NTCP tobacco control program managers and surveillance and evaluation staff in all States, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, national networks, and tribal support centers, as well as tobacco prevention and control partners and others as requested by OSH. The information gleaned from participants about desired net-conference topics will also help guide technical assistance in general.</p>

<p>Vendor:<br />March of Dimes<br />1275 Mamaroneck Avenue<br />White Plains, NY 10605</p>
<p>Background and Need:<br />In 2008, the Surgeon General's Conference on the Prevention of Preterm Birth was convened to address the serious problem of preterm birth. The importance of Quality of Care to prevent prematurity was recognized, and one of the six work groups created at the Conference focused on Quality of Care and Health Services. Each work group developed recommendations, but the conference participants agreed on some crosscutting issues. One was "Creating and evaluating quality measures for prenatal care are necessary to enhance prematurity prevention and clinical care."</p>
<p>A Symposium on Quality Improvement to prevent prematurity has been organized by the March of Dimes, and in collaboration with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM), and Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN). The intent is to bring together health care practitioners, health insurers, policy makers, and concerned citizens to discuss quality improvement, safety, and performance initiatives as important methods to prevent prematurity, promote health and save costs. The Symposium will be a forum where experts and stakeholders can share ideas, describe successful programs, and propose new interventions. The goal is to identify steps in the arena of quality improvement and patient safety to prevent premature births and to create an action agenda to decrease prematurity.</p>
<p><br />CDC is contemplating a Fixed Price award to secure the services of a vendor to (1) Enhance prematurity prevention efforts in the US through increased recognition of the importance and efficacy of quality improvement, patient safety, and professional performance programs to reduce prematurity rates and enhance pregnancy outcomes (2) Generate action plans for stakeholder groups outlining education and interventions to reduce prematurity.</p>
<p><br />Tasks:<br />1) CDC will provide support the planning, staff support, and development of conference materials for the Symposium on Quality Improvement to Prevent Prematurity that will be October 8-9, 2009 in Crystal City, Maryland.<br />2) Based on the information and recommendations of the Symposium, the March of Dimes will develop a survey, in consultation with CDC, to collect information from a group of large health systems, including health maintenance organizations and private payers, to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and practice regarding early and accurate gestational age dating. Information collected will include perceived clinical benefit of accurate dating, reimbursement for early, routine dating of pregnancies (including first trimester ultrasound), and methods for improving healthcare quality. identify policy and clinical issues related to gestational age dating and other quality improvement strategies to prevent preterm birth.</p>
</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Deliverables:</strong>The vendor shall provide the following deliverables to the Project Officer by the dates reflected below:</p>

<p>VENDOR: <br />American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists<br />409 12th Street, SW<br />Washington, DC 20090</p>
<p>1) BACKGROUND AND NEED -</p>
<p>Preterm birth (birth &lt; 37 weeks gestation) affects over 12% of all births in the United States, and has increased by 36% over the past 20 years. Among African American infants, the risk of preterm birth is even more concerning; 18% of infants born to non-Hispanic black mothers are born preterm. Preterm birth is the most frequent cause of infant mortality and severe neurologic disabilities in children. It is estimated that the cost of preterm birth in the United States exceeds $26 billion each year for medical care, special education needs, and lost productivity of affected families.</p>
<p>The rise in preterm birth over the past two decades has been nearly exclusively due to the increase in late preterm births (32-36 weeks gestation). Despite being the most common category of preterm birth, the health effects of late preterm birth have not been studied as extensively as has those of very preterm birth (Saigal and Doyle, 2008). Neonates born late preterm suffer increased morbidity and mortality compared with term infants (Shapiro-Mendoza et al., 2008). They experience higher frequencies of temperature instability, respiratory distress, hypoglycemia, seizures, jaundice, feeding difficulties and other complications (Saigal and Doyle, 2008). In a study of term and late preterm infants discharged prior to 48 hours, breast fed late preterm infants had a significantly higher rate of readmission (Tomashek et al., 2006). Many of the recent advances in neonatal care for preterm infants have not been shown to be effective for neonates born after 34 weeks gestational age. For example, the use of corticosteroids for lung and other organ maturation is recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) prior to 34 weeks gestational age, but not for after that gestational age as no benefit has been documented (ACOG, 2002). ACOG published the Committee Opinion #408 Late-Preterm Infants in April 2008 to bring increased awareness among obstetrician-gynecologists and other obstetric providers (ACOG, 2008).</p>
<p>Birth prior to 39 weeks gestational age is associated with increased respiratory complications (Yoder et al., 2008). Because of the evidence for increased risk to neonates born prior to 39 weeks gestational age, and even to infants born between 37 and 39 weeks, ACOG recommends that scheduled delivery only occur if fetal lung maturity of 39 weeks or more of gestational age has been confirmed ( ACOG, 2008).</p>
<p>Despite growing concerns about the risks of late preterm births, the reasons for the increase in the late preterm birth rates remain unknown. It is likely that there have been changes in clinical practice and clinical decision-making, although this topic has not been well studied or documented. It is unknown if patient demands or concerns have altered clinical practices, if the concomitant rise in the rate of Cesarean sections is related to the rise in late preterm, or if changes in providers concerns about clinical outcomes or medical malpractice may have changed clinical practice. In addition, it has been difficult to track the problem of preterm birth in the United States due to the inaccuracy of gestational age dating on vital records. Standard methods for reporting of gestational age rely on use of last menstrual period, which has been clearly demonstrated to be less accurate for determining gestational age compared with first trimester ultrasound or use of "best clinical estimate." It is unclear if providers' uncertainty about gestational age is related to changes in clinical decision-making or the rise in late preterm birth rates.</p>
<p><br />2) PROJECT OBJECTIVE -</p>
<p>The objective of this project is to develop a survey questionnaire in collaboration with ACOG colleagues. Questions will assess physicians' methods of estimating gestational age, perceived barriers to early gestational age dating (e.g. reimbursement concerns or perceived lack of clinical utility), decision-making strategies for timing assisted delivery, management of spontaneous late preterm labor and delivery, and immediate postpartum management of neonates delivered late preterm.</p>
<p>3) TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS -</p>
<p>The vendor shall perform the following tasks:</p>

Questions will assess physicians' methods of estimating gestational age, perceived barriers to early gestational age dating (e.g. reimbursement concerns or perceived lack of clinical utility), decision-making strategies for timing assisted delivery, management of spontaneous late preterm labor and delivery, and immediate postpartum management of neonates delivered late preterm. The questionnaire will also survey obstetrician-gynecologists' practice patterns, clinical experiences, basic knowledge, professional training, access to professional and patient resource materials, and self-reported educational needs relevant to issues pertinent to late preterm birth.
