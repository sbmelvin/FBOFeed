Los Angeles AFB invites you to join in supporting the morale, welfare and recreation of our military and their family members by becoming a commercial sponsor for the Base Picnic for the Air Force's 61st Birthday. Sponsorship may take the form of monetary or in-kind contributions. <br />In appreciation for your sponsorship, your company will receive public recognition and exposure.

<DESC>DARPA seeks innovative proposals that address development of long wave infrared (LWIR) focal plane arrays and signal processing to improve imaging in degraded atmospheric transmission, especially conditions encountered in helicopter brownout.  The scope includes two tasks: 1) Detector and focal plane array development and demonstration; and 2) Signal and imaging processing to enhance imaging in low transmission and brownout conditions. The objective of Task 1 is the demonstration of focal plane arrays with the individual detector element size of 5 um x 5um, interconnected to a read-out integrated circuit (ROIC) that integrates sufficient charge to achieve a noise equivalent temperature difference of 30 mk with F/1 optics , as seen in Table I.  Task 2 is the development of novel signal processing concepts addressing imaging in brownout conditions, with the objective of achieving target recognition at range of 500 meters when the transmission is 1.8%, as seen in Table II.  Proposals should address Task 1 or Task 2.  Proposers may submit proposals to both tasks; however they must be addressed in two separate proposals. All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to BAA08-54@darpa.mil.

<DESC><p>Operational Contracting, US Air Force Academy, intends to award a sole source purchase order utilizing simplified acquisition procedures to Audio Visual Innovations (AVI), 114 Inverness Circle East, Englewood, CO 80112 for purchase of of a Digital Video Capture Classroom.</p>
<p>The following are primary reasons for this sole source procurement, for which only one responsible sourc will satisfy the Air Force Academy's requirement:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; This request is part of an Institutional Information Technology Applications (ITTA) funded research project led by the Department of English and Fine Arts (DFENG). This project will establish a first-ever digital video capture and feedback classroom at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) for its core advanced writing and speech course-English 411.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; As part of this first-ever initiative, we require a user-friendly interface, including all input and output devices, for a system that will allow any instructor to operate all aspects of the classroom (cameras, projectors, audio, output selection, etc.) through a simple, graphics-driven, touch screen interface.&nbsp; Additionally, this user interface must work seamlessly with all associated components in the classroom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; This unique interface capability, including multi-system interoperability to meet our mission needs, is only available through AVI.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Supplies and/or services are available from only one responsible source.&nbsp; No other type of supply or service will satisfy agency requirements.&nbsp; Interested persons may identifiy their interest and capability to meet this requirement.&nbsp; This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. If no response is received by September 05, 2008 to the effect that comparable supplies and/or services are available that would be more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these supplies and/or services through a sole source procurement with Audio Visual Innovations (AVI), a sole source award will be made.</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to issue a modification to contract N61331-08-C-0014 to Complete Parachute Systems (CPS).     Under contract N61331-08-C-0014, CPS is manufacturing and delivering multi-mission and other type parachute equipment. The USMC has identified a need for training to support the multi-mission parachute equipment. The Government intends to add two training classes to contract N61331-08-C-0014 for USMC personnel. CPS, as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the parachutes, is the only source with the prerequisite experience, knowledge, and expertise required to successfully perform this requirement.  Unrecoverable duplicative costs and unacceptable schedule delays would result if award were made to any source other than CPS.  Therefore, this acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition.  Delivery of training will be made to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  Other sources interested in qualifying their products for future acquisitions should contact Kevin Lang at 850-235-5485. NAICS 314999. FSC 1670.   The award will be based on an acceptable proposal on or about 30 Sep 2008. SBA Size Standard is 500 Employees.

The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport, anticipates awarding a contract on a sole source basis to Panavision Federal Systems, Woodland Hills, CA for Research and Development to develop and build a 360 degree module for use with the Digital Periscope.   The basic requirement will require the design and fabrication of the imaging module pressure housing along with associated data.  Options will be included for a 360 degree Imaging Module Transition study, an imaging module and imaging sensor module design, imaging sensor Engineering Development Model, inboard processing unit, production drawings, provisioned item ordering and 1,000 hours of engineering services.  The contract type will be Cost Plus Fixed Fee.  The sole source is based on the fact that the Optical Sensor Package (Digital Periscope) is a preproduction unit for which neither a sufficient data package exists nor has a physical configuration audit been performed.  Award to another vendor would represent a duplication of costs as the new vendor would have to become familiarized with the system which would also cause unacceptable delays to the program.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management on behalf of the Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to negotiate and award a sole-source simplified acquisition to the American Medical Association, 515 North State Street, Chicago, IL, 60610.

This acquisition is for Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) licensing for 7000 users for use by IHS in each instance of the Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS).

The Indian Health Service (IHS) uses the CPT code set in its distributed health information system, the RPMS.  Using CPT codes is essential to its clinical applications and to its practice management applications.  CPT codes are recognized in the industry as standard for codifying medical procedures.  The vast majority of third party insurance providers require CPT codes on all claims.  The AMA holds copyright on CPT and use or reprinting of CPT in any product or publication requires a license from the AMA.

This acquisition is being conducted on a sole-source basis because American Medical Association is the sole-source of CPT codes.

This simplified acquisition is for a product for which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source.  Interested concerns may identify their interest in and capability to satisfy the requirement within 15 days after the date of publication of this notice.  Capability statements may be submitted to Anthony Webb, Room 5-101, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, or via email at awebb@psc.gov.

Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<a href="mailto:Steve.Garanin@volpe.dot.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The United States Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) intends to award a contract, based on a sole source procurement, to Sensis Corporation in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements. The Volpe Center intends to procure, through a Firm-Fixed Price contract, to provide the following supplies and services: supply, install and configure four Airport Surface Detection Equipment Model X (ASDE-X) Data Distribution Cabinets to be used to integrate ASDE-X  data from the Newark Liberty International, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, Boston Logan International and the Orlando International Airports with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA's) Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS), by November 30th, 2008.  The Sensis Corporation is currently the only company that has a commercially available airport surface management tool, which has been approved by the FAA for integration with the FAA's ASDE-X system.
The Volpe Center is assisting the FAA's Air Traffic Systems Operations Division with the integration of Newark, Atlanta, Boston and Orlando Airport's ASDE-X data into the ETMS.  This will require the purchase, delivery, installation and configuration of ASDE-X Data Distribution cabinets: one for each of the four sites.  Site engineering and preparation is required prior to the placement of the Data Distribution cabinets.   
This combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items is prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition regulation (FAR) Part 12, Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The Contracting Officer is utilizing policies and procedures prescribed in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items; FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation; and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26. The applicable North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334511; the Small Business size standard is 750 employees.
STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) BEGIN-BACKGROUND:
Among the many challenges facing U.S. aviation, two of the most important are enhancing the efficiency of air-traffic flow and improving the safety of aviation systems. The Volpe Center provides support to FAA Systems Operations addressing these challenges.  Key to reducing en route congestion in the nation's airways is the integration of new technologies and techniques that enable more effective responses to changing conditions, such as congestion, equipment outages, and weather.
The ETMS is an automation system developed by Volpe's Automated Applications Division for the FAA to track, anticipate, and manage the flow of air traffic throughout U.S. airspace.  It integrates real-time flight and weather data from multiple sources, presenting information graphically in a highly adaptable format. ETMS includes capabilities for en route congestion management, enhanced collaborative decision making with airlines, and access to improved severe weather forecasts.
The FAA is currently implementing ASDE-X systems at multiple airports in the National Airspace System (NAS) throughout the country. The ASDE-X provides Air Traffic Local and Ground Controllers with situational awareness of aircraft and vehicles within the airport movement area. The ADSE-X is one of the FAA's primary systems to minimize runway incursions and accidents.  ASDE-X also provides a data distribution capability which will provide the ETMS the necessary airport surface and approach surveillance data to enhance its capabilities.
The FAA's Collaborative Air Traffic Management Technologies (CATMT) program is aimed at future capability enhancement.  The addition of airport surface information into the traffic flow management systems could enhance ETMS capabilities with earlier predictions and modeling of traffic and congestion rather than waiting to develop real-time predictions and models based on actual departure data.  
The Contractor shall supply, install, integrate and check-out four ASDE-X Data Distribution Cabinets, one each for the Newark, Boston, Atlanta and Orlando airports prior to November 30, 2008.   The Data Distribution Cabinets and all aspects of the installation shall be fully warranted for 90 days once the cabinet(s) has been accepted by the Government.
ASDE-X DATA DISTRIBUTION CABINET:
The Contractor shall produce and deliver four ASDE-X Data Distribution Cabinets to the airports identified within.  The ASDE-X Data Distribution system shall include all software, firmware, hardware, interfaces, commercial and non commercial licenses, documentation and special support equipment necessary to install, operate and maintain the ASDE-X Data Distribution System at each of the airports identified herein.
The Data Distribution Cabinets shall include the factory testing typically required for acceptance by the FAA's ASDE-X program.   A report reflecting the successful factory testing of each Data Distribution Cabinet shall be provided to the Government's Technical Officer prior to the delivery of each cabinet. 
SITE SURVEY AND ENGINEERING:
The Contractor shall conduct a site engineering survey at each of the airports in order to identify potential sites for hardware to hardware mounting locations, access to installation areas, power, cooling and other infrastructure issues.  Guidance concerning equipment installation requirements and constraints are found in: ASDE-X System Installation Constraints Table doc. No. 830-009924.  Any deviations from this guidance shall be approved by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR).  The site survey shall be sufficient to enable the modification of 'Government Supplied' site engineering drawings for the site preparation and installation of the Data Distribution cabinet and the required connections.  The information collected shall include the identification of equipment locations, equipment access issues, power source, cable routing, and structural issues that affect mounting.   The survey shall also identify administrative issues such as security requirements, site personnel and operating hours. 
Within 5 working days of the site engineering survey the Contractor shall provide a trip report to the COTR and Contracting Officer which summarizes the site engineering survey and provides the information collected necessary to prepare the site, install and integrate the Data Distribution system with the ASDE-X.  The contractor shall provide a red-line set of site engineering drawings which identifies all site preparation identified with the specifications and requirements necessary for the site preparation and installation of the ASDE-X Data Distribution Cabinets.  
INSTALLATION:
The Contractor shall deliver, install, integrate with ASDE-X, align, checkout, adapt, and optimize as necessary ASDE-X Data Distribution Cabinet at each of the identified airports.  The Data Distribution Cabinet shall be integrated with ASDE-X systems at each of the identified airports.  Installation shall include the supply and installation of the two data lines necessary to supply data to the ETMS system at each airport.  At a minimum the Data Distribution Cabinet shall be setup to operate with the ETMS system at each site.
All installation work shall be done within the parameters and specifications established in the Government approved version of the Site Engineering Drawings and Specifications produced as part of the site engineering surveys.
The Contractor shall develop and deliver to the COTR and Contracting Officer an installation plan and checklist to support the installation and check-out efforts within 10 days of Contract Award.
All work shall be accomplished within the framework of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 and FAA Order 1050.1, Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts. All Contractor personnel shall comply with the FAA's security controls as stated in FAA Order 1600.1, Personnel Security Program.
Air traffic control activities and services will have priority over all Contractor activities.  The Contractor shall provide services in a manner that do not add to Air Traffic (AT) and AF workload, minimizes disruptions to air traffic control facilities and conforms to the procedures considered essential by the Government for assuring safety in air traffic control. There shall be no compromise for the safe and timely control of aircraft during the entire installation period. 
Equipment, items, parts, or services specifically required to install, test, and checkout each Data Distribution Cabinet within the designated areas shall be provided by the Contractor.  All installation hardware shall be new material.  The Data Distribution Cabinets shall be installed in Government identified facilities under the oversight of the Volpe Center's COTR.  
Installation and checkout of equipment shall be scheduled and coordinated with the COTR, local and regional air traffic and airway facilities personnel.
SITE ACCEPTANCE TESTING:
After satisfactory completion of installation, tune-up, and preliminary checks of the system, the Contractor shall provide technical support for an operational inspection by the Government and shall demonstrate compliance with the specifications and requirements defined in the Engineering Drawing and Specifications Package and a sub-set of the current ASDE-X Production Site Acceptance Test (SAT) procedures.
The Site Acceptance Testing shall confirm that the ASDE-X Data Distribution System is properly installed and operationally configured, is undamaged and free from manufacturing defects, and remains in compliance with contractual requirements.  
The SAT shall be executed on the fully installed and optimized ASDE-X system and shall also include:

Functional Performance Testing: The Contractor shall demonstrate the Status and Control functionality of the ASDE-X system verifying the ability of the operational user to control and monitor the status and operating modes of the Data Distribution system.  
Stability Testing: The Data Distribution system shall be run continuously for 72 hours without error.  Any interruption of service or errors detected shall be noted.  Normal system operations including channel changes, data collection, performance monitoring, fault isolation testing, data extraction and off-line diagnostics shall be conducted during the Stability Test.  The system and any necessary ASDE-X components shall run error and interruption free for 72 hours before this test is considered complete unless otherwise agreed to by the Government.

<DESC>The United States Geological Survey (USGS), Western Region Geospatial Information Office and Hawaiian field offices intends to make a non-competitive award to Hawaiian Tel (HI Tel) of Honolulu, Hawaii for technology that supports interisland connectivity using virtual LAN technology by establishing Ethernet connections to each Hawaiian office location.  USGS has the need to upgrade their existing HI Tel network services from frame relay to Ethernet over MPLS at 5 -25 Mbps data rates.  Since HI Tel is the only LEC, they alone can provide this upgrade.  Once the upgrade has been completed, the USGS will require the enhanced IP Data Service (25 Mbps) at three (3) locations in Hawaii for one (1) base year and four (4) option years.
USGS currently has five (5) offices located on four (4) islands in Hawaii.  They are located in Honolulu (Oahu), Lihue (Kauai), Kahului (Maui), and two (2) offices within the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island of Hawaii (HVO and PIERC Field Office). USGS also supports an additional Hawaii network backbone node in Kihei, Maui located at the Maui High Performance Computing Center.  All of these sites are currently connected by a frame relay network comprised of T-1 (1.544 Mbps) circuits with a committed information rate (CIR) of 384-768 kbps.  This technology is provisioned from Hawaiian Tel (HI Tel) the only interisland local exchange carrier (LEC) and Telephone Company in Hawaii.  Frame relay circuitry is very old technology with limitations that prevent USGS from provisioning the bandwidth required to support current and future functional requirements.  For example, multiple frame relay circuits cannot be inverse multiplexed (aggregated) to obtain more bandwidth.  Additionally, because the 001 Enterprise Services Network (ESN) restricts asymmetric data flows (in and out of multiple circuit paths), traffic can't be load balanced over multiple circuits to obtain additional bandwidth.  Therefore, all USGS Hawaii sites are currently restricted to a maximum committed bandwidth rate of 768 kbps. 
In January of 2008, HI Tel announced the availability of new network services based on a fault tolerant MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) technology.  This technology supports interisland connectivity using virtual LAN technology by establishing Ethernet connections to each office location.  Offices requiring low bandwidth (5 Mbps) that are located near HI Tel Central Offices (COs) can utilize existing copper cabling to provision service.  This is the case for Lihue, Kahului, and Kihei. However, offices that are distant from COs and require higher bandwidth (25 Mbps) require fiber optic cabling. This requirement exists for Honolulu, HVO and PIERC FO.  However, fiber cabling is currently not available from the CO to the HI Tel demarcation point at these locations to provision the vLAN service.  In the case of the Honolulu office, a small segment of fiber must be installed from Ala Moana Blvd in to the building.  In the case of the Big Island offices, a segment of fiber optic cabling must be installed in a section of the National Park that is currently only serviced by copper cabling. This can be accomplished by HI Tel using existing company telephone poles, and splicing into HI Tel fiber that already exists from the Kilauea Military Camp (KMC) to HVO.  No other company has a telephone pole infrastructure or existing fiber in the National Park. 
In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(13), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency, to the Contract Specialist no later than the closing date of this announcement.  All responses must be in writing by email to the Contract Specialist at sklingler@usgs.gov.   
This notice and any resulting solicitation or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-26, effective 12 June 2008.

<p>Department of the Air Force; Air Force Materiel Command; Hill AFB OO-ALC; OO-ALC/84 CBSG/PK; 6039 Wardleigh Road, Bldg. 1206; Hill AFB; UT 84056-5838</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Synopsis constitutes a request for information to assist the Air Force in conducting market research of industry to identify potential sources that may meet Air Force requirements for production of the following Joint Threat Emitter (JTE) Block 0 Kit 1 units: approximately sixty (60) Receiver-Transmitters Group, OA-9520/TSQ-T10 (previously known as threat emitter units (TEUs)) with Part Number 200532017 and NSN: 5895015434399FD); approximately fifteen (15) Tactical Computer Console units, OJ-824/TSQ-T10 (previously known as fixed command and control units (C2Us)) with Part Number 200734626 and NSN: 7022015525382FD; approximately fifteen (15) Receiver-Transmitter Control Group, OK-675/TSQ-T10 (previously known as mobile C2Us) with JTE Part Number 200425533 and NSN:5895015434728FD; approximately sixty (60) infrared (IR) cameras procured from a source control drawing with JTE Part Number 200425458, and related integration (as an integral/incidental part of the JTE unit deliveries) of these JTE Units on typical training ranges. This procurement will also include fourteen (14) JTE Wideband Kits (only the Enhanced Threat Capability Kit will be procured with JTE Part Number 684-1000001-01, NSN not assigned as yet) which do not require any range integration effort. The wideband kit is designed as an interchangeable replacement of the TEU emitter kit #1 and is comprised of a complement of five transmitters required to generate the RF threat signals listed in Appendix A of the JTE Signal Definition Document. Site surveys are to be accomplished to characterize and document existing range infrastructure for up to ten (10) training ranges which will host these JTE Block 0 Kit 1 production units. Extensive travel is projected to support preparation and execution of site installation and test as well as Program Management Reviews (PMRs).</p>
<p>The Hill AFB, Utah Range Threat System Program Office (RTSPO) intends to generate a purchase request leading to firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract award for the production of these systems during a production phase that is projected to include a production rate of six (6) mobile C2Us, six (6) fixed C2Us, twelve (12) TEUs, twelve (12) IR cameras, and three (3) wideband kits per year over a production period planned to be five (5) years in duration. The infrastructure effort may utilize a pricing arrangement other than FFP. The performance period is projected to be divided into a one year basic contract with four one year options, or to be a five-year indefinite-delivery-indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract. A responding company must provide rationale if a fixed-type pricing arrangement is deemed inappropriate for their production approach. The contract award may be against a new contract, an existing delivery order contract, and/or an existing delivery order. THIS SHALL BE A NONDEVELOPMENTAL EFFORT.</p>
<p>This request for information is for production of high-fidelity systems that will be deployed on Air Force and Navy major large force exercise ranges, and primary training ranges to include Electronic Scoring Sites (ESS). This advanced threat training environment will match actual combat conditions as closely as possible in the type, density, deployment, and employment of anticipated threats. The JTE Block 0 Kit 1 and Wideband Kit provide dispersed threat signals to aircrews during simulated penetrations of hostile airspace for surveillance and bombing runs, for the purpose of aircrew tactics and electronic combat (EC) training. JTE uses an automatic tracking capability to acquire an aircraft and execute computer-controlled, user re-programmable threat scenarios. JTE is or could be deployed at improved (e.g. graded roads and concrete pad) and unimproved (e.g. no roads, no pad - literally anywhere on a range) sites. JTE complements existing threat simulators/real threats deployed on test and training ranges by emulating signals which simulate the latest and most advanced air defense threat radars.</p>
<p>Delivered/integrated JTE units/systems must meet the complete requirements in the JTE System Specification (as contractually revised up to the point of releasing an RFP for the potential requirement identified in this sources sought synopsis) for which MTC Technologies, Inc/Cage Code 9J721 is the prime contractor under delivery order F09603-01-D-0209-QP05. The units/systems must also meet all of the detailed data and software specifications that the Government does not possess and all of the data and software specifications that the government can't release due to lack of rights (see next paragraph). Delivered Wideband Kits must meet the complete and exact design requirements of what is being delivered under contract FA8217-07-C-0046 (under which Amherst Systems, Inc/Cage Code 1L4J7 is performing as the prime contractor), including all of the detailed data and software specifications that the Government does not possess and all of the data and software specifications that the government can't release due to lack of rights.</p>
<p>The government does not have a competitive bid package for this procurement. The threat emitter unit signal generator (CEESIM) software/hardware is an example of technical data (for both the Block 0 Kit 1 and Wideband TEU configurations) that the government does not have adequate rights to release to support a competitive bid package. The government also does not have the related subsystem specifications (necessary for production) in their possession to support a competitive bid package. Since the government does not have a competitive bid package for the JTE Block 0 Kit 1 TEU or the JTE Wideband Kit, any interested parties must clearly identify with supporting rationale if they have the ability to meet the requirements without a competitive bid package from the government. At a minimum, the following is the technical data and software associated with the JTE Block 0, Kit 1 configuration and Wideband Kit that cannot be released due to limited and/or restricted rights:</p>
<p>- Threat emitter unit signal generator (CEESIM) software<br />- Range data integration processor components of the command &amp; control subsystem software<br />- Mission situation awareness terminal components of the command &amp; control subsystem software<br />- Transmitter controller software</p>
<p>Access to this data is also required to meet the site survey, infrastructure planning/utilization, and integration requirements associated with this effort due to the need to understand fully the structure and timing of the data sent and received via system internal and external interfaces.</p>
<p>This effort will require access to and processing of classified information up to and including SECRET/NOFORN security requirements. The corresponding DD254 will be provided as part of the associated solicitation. Contract performance is also expected to involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) shall be provided copies of any related solicitation or other data subject to foreign disclosure restrictions. Contact the Defense Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan 40917-3084 (1-800-353-3572) for further information on the certification process. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your request for any related solicitation.</p>
<p>Each interested entity that has the capability to meet the production requirements for JTE Block 0 Kit 1 and Wideband Kits hereby has the opportunity to provide supporting rationale to that effect. Each interested entity (that has the capability to meet any specific (or all) of the requirements is requested to provide the following information to help the Air Force determine prospective contractors:</p>
<p>(1) Supporting rationale that they possess, soon will possess, or have/will-have a formal business relationship with an entity that does possess, all of the data, drawings, and other technology that is necessary for meeting the requirement(s) identified above. Supporting rationale must show evidence (from the company that has complete data, drawing, software, etc. package for each requirement) that this company is providing this package to the company that is responding to the sources-sought-synopsis or that this company is willing to partner up with the company that is responding to the sources-sought-synopsis.<br />(2) Supporting rationale that they have the expertise and capability to meet such requirement(s).</p>
<p>Please respond to: Department of the Air Force; Air Force Materiel Command; Hill AFB OO-ALC; OO-ALC/84 CBSG/PK; Attn: James G. Thiros; 6039 Wardleigh Road, Bldg. 1206; Hill AFB; UT 84056-5838 (or e-mail: James.Thiros@hill.af.mil). fax is (801) 586-3366. If the response is not through an e-mail, please send an e-mail to notify that the response has been mailed or faxed.</p>
<p>Responses are due no later than the response date identified above. No phone responses will be accepted. Note that a request for proposal would include requirements that are more detailed than what is identified in this sources sought synopsis.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposal (RFP) or an invitation for bid, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government. The government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this sources sought synopsis/request for information or otherwise pay for the information solicited herein. Copies of the submitted information will be reproduced and review may be used to develop a request for proposal.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing  market research to determine potential small business sources in preparation for an upcoming procurement.
EPA has a requirement for a shield that is intended to provide an ultra-low radiation background for a high purity germanium detector to be used for general purpose high resolution gamma spectrometry of a wide range of sample types, including water, soil, and air.
The selected contractor will install the tungsten powder in the shield assembly either at their place of manufacture, or after delivery to the National Air and Radiation Environmental Laboratory (NAREL) in Montgomery, AL, at their option.  The quotation must be firm fixed price and include any necessary travel and per diem expenses, if required, as outlined above.  EPA will not separately reimburse travel expenses.  Both items one and two must be properly packaged for shipment by motor freight.  The NAREL cannot accept rail or bulk shipments.  Furthermore,  the small business must be able to purchase all necessary items, including the tungsten powder up front.  Payment will not be made by the Government until all items have been delivered to NAREL.
Item 1 ? Low Background Shield AssemblyThe shield is intended to be used to house and reduce background radiation for a nominal 150% efficiency coaxial P-type Germanium radiation detector.  The detector will be in a vertical dipstick cryostat configuration but will initially be cooled by a mechanical cooler.  It is possible that liquid nitrogen cooling  may be used in the future, so sufficient room is required under the shield assembly for a standard 30L liquid nitrogen dewar.  Samples will be placed inside the shield and on the detector from the top.The following requirements have been determined for the low-background shield assembly:A	The shield assembly will consist of a shield and a table stand.B	The shield shall be cylindrical, with an inner cavity to house the detector and samples.	1	The final finished diameter of the shield assembly shall not exceed 22?.	2	The final inner dimensions of the shield will for a void no less than 11? diameter by 16? high.	3	The shield is to have three components, a main side wall shell, a moveable lid assembly, and a base.C	The shield shall be fabricated as a hollow shell that will be packed with tungsten powder. 	1	The assembled shield will consist of an outer wall and inner wall that will retain tungsten powder at a depth of 4 inches between the outer and inner walls.	2	The inner and outer walls will be manufactured to the minimum wall thickness necessary to support the structure of the shield and to retain the tungsten powder.	3	The outer wall of the shield shall be carbon steel.	4	The support table top may be used as part of the outer shell of the shield, if a means is 	provided to ensure that when filled, the tungsten powder will not leak through gaps between the bottom of the cylindrical shield walls and the table top.	5	The inner wall of the shield shall be copper, including top, bottom, and sides.	6	A vertical hole, 4.5? in diameter, shall be provided in the base of the shield to allow for insertion of the detector and passage of refrigerant tubing to the detector.  This penetration shall be lined with copper as in C.5 above to contain the tungsten powder.	7	The lid of the shield shall be a separate piece and shall have provisions for easy and quick access to the shield cavity for placing and removing samples.  Any variation of hinged or roll top designs are acceptable provided that the specific design has been previously and successfully used.  New designs must be submitted for EPA approval prior to manufacture.  The lid design must ensure that, when the lid is closed, there is not a direct streaming path between the active volume of the detector and any point outside of the shield.  For purposes of this requirement, the detector active volume may be assumed to be a cylinder 3.5? in diameter and 4? high, centered in the cavity of the shield.	8	After fabrication, all exposed steel surfaces shall be cleaned and painted for corrosion 		protection and appearance.  The color selected shall be identical to the color used to finish the support table.D		The shield shall be capable of being filled with tungsten powder that meets the 	requirements for Item 2 below. 	1	The process used to fill the shield shell shall ensure that there are no voids.	2	This may be performed either at the place of manufacture, or during installation of the shield assembly at the National Air and Radiation Laboratory in Montgomery, AL.E	The shield assembly must be warranted to be free of defects in material and workmanship for at least one year from the time of acceptance by EPA.  The warranty must provide for repair or replacement at no cost to the government, and shall not require the government to pay for shipping or handling costs for return of defective equipment for repairF	The shield shall be supported by a carbon steel table with four legs:	1	The table surface shall be between 29? and 31? above floor level.  For leveling purposes, 	each leg shall be equipped with a means of adjusting height over a continuous range of at least 1?.	2	The table surface shall be square, with a width and depth of at least 24? but no more than 25?.	3	An open area, at least 18.5? wide, 18.5? deep, and 24? high (above the floor), shall be maintained under the table top and between the four legs.  Cross members between legs are permissible provided that on at least one side access must be provided for sliding an 18? diameter liquid nitrogen dewar into position under the shield.  If a cross member is used at this point of access, it must be removable and it can not be a structural support 		member.	4	The table surface is to have a hole, 4.5? in diameter, in the center for installation and removal of the detector and refrigerant tubing.	5	Structural components of the table, including the leg leveling mechanisms, shall be of adequate strength to support at least 150% of the expected weight of the shield when filled with tungsten powder.
	6	After fabrication, all exposed steel surfaces shall be cleaned and painted for corrosion protection and appearance.G	Instructions and/or drawings that describe how to safely fill, move, set up, maintain, and use the shield assembly shall be provided. Any drawings provided shall identify components by part  number and be accompanied by part lists that include all components shown in the drawings.

<RESPDATE>091208
<CONTACT>Shannon C. Malisani, Contracts Specialist, Phone 5093756814, Fax 5093752605, Email shannon.malisani@pnl.gov
<DESC><p>Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division (Battelle), operator of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) for the United States Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking information from companies, educational institutions, research and development laboratories (public and private), or other sources about commercially or government available equipment, or near-commercial technologies that may be used for the detection of radioactive materials and/or special nuclear materials at Department of Defense (DoD) installations.
<p>This request for information (RFI) is part of an overall strategy to identify the next generation of radiological interdiction equipment for fielding as soon as next fiscal year, which begins October 1, 2008. The information obtained by this RFI will be included in a market survey that will be coupled with a test campaign to determine what system or systems should be recommended to the client for fielding. The phasing of this strategy may include:</p>
<p>&bull; Sources sought announcement<br />&bull; Market study and preliminary testing (PNNL may test systems upon request of the vendors)<br />&bull; Ranking and formal testing (top 2-5 systems based on ranking criteria may be tested by PNNL)<br />&bull; Recommendation (top 1-3 systems) that may include one or more of the following:<br />&nbsp; o Spectroscopic<br />&nbsp; o Non-spectroscopic<br />&nbsp; o Portable system<br />&bull; Procurement action<br />&bull; Acceptance testing<br />&bull; Prototype fielding<br />&bull; Unrestricted fielding<br />&bull; Lifecycle maintenance and improvements</p>
<p>Interested organizations/companies/institutions may propose to have their equipment tested at PNNL or provide PNNL with the results of a screening test procedure as part of the aforementioned market survey. The screening procedure will be provided upon request. NOTE: equipment provided to PNNL for testing must be &lsquo;cord and plug' and should be National Recognized Testing Laboratory (e.g. Underwriters Laboratory) listed.</p>
<p>PNNL is interested in information on systems that would be usable for improved sensing of radioactive materials in commercial vehicles of all sizes and shapes, and personal vehicles of all sizes and shapes. Both high volume screening instruments, and detailed inspection instruments are of interest. Specifically, PNNL is looking for information regarding the expected technical capability and effectiveness of currently (or soon to be) available instrumentation with respect to expected threats given the speed, distance, shielding, etc. conditions that are typically found at vehicle crossings. Operational issues, specifically detection probabilities and false alarm probabilities for typical measurement conditions are of particular interest. Other issues that might impact operations, such as required facility modifications, reliability and robustness, training requirements (must not require extensive user training), and health and safety issues are also of interest.</p>
<p>Interest is in both spectroscopic and non-spectroscopic systems depending on potential deployment needs. Interest is also in both fixed and portable systems.</p>
<p>Of key interest is the ability to discriminate medical isotopes from threat and non-threat materials.</p>
<p>Fixed sensors are intended for deployment at the entry points to installations. Portable sensors may be deployed at entry points in a semi-permanent fashion or placed in temporary locations on a random basis. Portable sensors will be used to supplement or replace fixed sensors.</p>
<p>Technical requirements and criteria include:</p>
<p>&bull; ANSI N.42 compliance<br />&bull; National Recognized Testing Laboratory (e.g. Underwriters Laboratory) listed<br />&bull; Deployed vs. developmental system<br />&bull; Yearly maintenance and calibration requirements (type and frequency)<br />&bull; Mean time between failure, mean time between repair<br />&bull; Average system availability (lead time)<br />&bull; Infrastructure needs for power, signal, and communication<br />&bull; Networkability (how many systems can populate the same network)<br />&bull; Database structure and storage capability<br />&bull; Ability to discriminate Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material and Medical Isotopes from other sources of radiation<br />&bull; The overall effectiveness of the instruments automated ability to detect and identify (spectral gamma-ray analysis) or discriminate between various sources of radiation is of particular interest<br />&bull; Sensitivity in counts per second per micro-curie for the following isotopes (upper and lower thresholds):<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;o Am-241<br />&nbsp; o Co-60<br />&nbsp; o Cs-137<br />&nbsp; o Ba-133<br />&nbsp; o Co-57<br />&bull; Sensitivity for the following isotopes in counts per second per gram (upper and lower thresholds):<br />&nbsp; o HEU<br />&nbsp; o Weapons Grade Pu<br />&nbsp; o Reactor Grade Pu<br />&nbsp; o DU<br />&bull; Support for external interfaces (traffic lights, extraction of data)<br />&bull; Ability to correctly identify occupancy generating radiation profile (e.g. vehicle detection)<br />&bull; Integral or interface for image capture of occupancy (up to 2 cameras)<br />&bull; Sensitivity to neutrons (if applicable, note upper and lower thresholds)<br />&bull; Response time (time to alarm)<br />&bull; Alarm settings and modes available<br />&bull; Ability to identify and quantify presence multiple isotopes simultaneously</p>
<p>Please note that this is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This is NOT a request for proposal and there is no solicitation package available at this time. Participation does not imply any obligation by Battelle, PNNL, DOE or the United States Government or any agency thereof.</p>
<p>Proprietary information will be protected to the greatest extent provided by law. We will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will we compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to us.</p>
<p>Interested organizations/companies/institutions are encouraged to respond to this notice by providing a short written summary (no longer than twenty pages) of their equipment capabilities.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the equipment described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 10 calendar days from the date of the announcement.  The USGS, Texas Water Science Center, is requesting the purchase of an IP upgrade to the IRIS Syscal Pro which includes an external transmitter for injecting a known current into the subsurface and a firmware upgrade to a currently owned IRIS Syscal Pro unit so that IP data can be collected.  IP is a geophysical method that uses a current to polarize objects in the subsurface.  The unit then measures the rate at which it takes for these objects to return to static conditions.  This technique could be used to lacate metallic objects as well as clay lenses.  The transmitter and firmware upgrade must be fully compatible with an IRIS Syscal Pro DC resistivity unit.
Based on information at this time, the government considers this equipment as a sole source from Heritage Geophysics and proposes to negotiate a contract with the firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required equipment are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, request for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Governments only official notice of the procurement.

<DESC>The Coast Guard (CG) Research and Development Center (R&DC) is conducting market research to establish potential sources of supply for use of force tools to warn and/or stop vessels during security operations in domestic port areas.  CG Boat forces currently use the M-240B Mounted Automatic Weapon (MAW) in security operations throughout the United States. 

You are invited to respond with information to assist the CG R&DC in their market research for a potential enhancement/replacement of the current M-240B MAW used by CG Boat forces.  The Coast Guard is interested in technology to improve, augment, or replace the current M-240B MAW configuration to maximize effectiveness in (1) warning and (2) stopping potentially threatening vessels while minimizing potential collateral damage. Potential solutions may range from aiming and stabilization/aiming-assistance technology for the current M-240B MAW, to complete replacement of the current MAW with a new weapon/tool (or suite of weapons/tools) for warning and stopping vessels. Kinetic systems (ordinance based) and non-kinetic systems (ignition interruption, combustion inhibiters or other systems) are of interest to the Coast Guard.  In addition, both lethal and less-than-lethal solution systems are of interest.  Solution systems must be suitable for hard-mounting the weapon to the boat, or suitable for storage, retrieval, and operation aboard CG small boats from 25ft to 47ft.  Systems that would eliminate the need for crewman to operate outside the cabin are of interest.

Minimum Engineering Criteria (not in any particular order): 

(1) System must be able to be hard-mounted - or - stored, retrieved, and operated hand-held aboard CG boats 25ft to 47ft; 
(2) System must withstand daily exposure to sunlight, sea spray, salt water and salt-residue typically found in the CG operating environment; 
(3) System should be person-portable - or - easily aimed, operated & manipulated by crewmembers of various size and stature;
(4) System must be fully operable with no loss of effectiveness in sustained winds up to 35kts, and temperatures from -20 degrees to 120 degrees Fahrenheit;
(5) Able to withstand shock, violent impacts, jarring, and sudden accelerations of up to 3.5G associated with tactical maneuvers in various sea conditions;

(6) Powered by systems compatible with 12V typical marine power and should not require additional power generation capacity aboard CG boats;

(7) Total weight of system (including ammunition) should not exceed 250 lbs;
(8) Self-powered (battery or other) systems must be fully operational for 10 hrs without re-charging; 12 or more hours is preferred; and

(9) DOD Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 7 or higher. 


 Desired Performance Attributes (ranked in descending order of importance): 

(1) The ability to quickly and reliably stop vessels of 40 and less (with inboard or outboard engines);

(2) The ability to deliver clear audible and/or visual warning cues to threatening vessels;

(3) The ability to prepare, aim, and fire in less time than the current capability;

(4) The ability for ammunition to become inert or quickly lose kinetic energy if target is missed;

(5) The ability of the system to be remotely aimed and fired from inside the cabin;

(6) Minimal required maintenance and calibration; and

(7) Ease of use/ergonomics (requiring gross motor skills rather than fine motor skills; accurate targeting even under substantial vessel motion, low light, or other adverse conditions).

 

When responding to this market survey, please include the following information:

(A) A detailed description of the potential solution system; 

(B) Current TRL and next production milestone (if not Commercial-off-the-Shelf);

(C) Cost estimate for full production solution system per boat; 

(D) Cost and description of training, training aids or other necessary off boat components; and 

(E) Business Size with regard to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code

<DESC>Market Research/Sources Sought Synopsis
The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) seeks to obtain market research information from sources capable of fully satisfying a Squad Combined Arms Link (SCAL) for call for fire capability identified herein.  This Request for Information (RFI) is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind.  Any information received, in whole or in part, may be used to create a resulting acquisition strategy for the proposed requirements.  Responders will not be reimbursed for any information received and are encouraged not to provide proprietary data or business sensitive information as any information received may be used by the Government and/or released to the public.  The Government is primarily focused on seeking suitable commercial and non-developmental items or commercial items that can be easily modified to meet existing Government requirements. If no such commercial/non-developmental items currently exist, the Government may entertain the procurement of developmental items based on the information received because of this market research.
Situational Description: With small units potentially spread across a complete battlespace, the need for target prosecution at the Squad level is being investigated.  An ability is sought, to identify and Laser designate the target, request Call For Fire (CFF), Close Air Support (CAS), and transmit the information using a C2 device.  This will combine task requirements so that a Marine can locate a target and identify it, (ten digit grid coordinate) and request support. That C2 device should be able to broadcast a CFF and a "9 Line and deconflict munitions trajectories and aircraft final attack headings using a mapping tool.  It should also simultaneously broadcast this information to a command operations center (COC), where an FAC/JTAC/FDC approving authority would clear CAS/CFF request.The intent is for a Marine, Soldier or Sailor, to get munitions on target within a few minutes of identifying a target, as opposed to the current extended time delay.  As units are distributed across the battlefield, not enough specialist MOS personnel are available.  Current equipment is capable of one or many of the tasks described, but they collectively weigh a large amount and are cumbersome.

<DESC>This is a combined sources sought and pre-solicitation notice.  This is not a Request for proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Governments acquisition approach.  The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any industry input as a result of this announcement.  This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Any costs incurred as a result of this announcement shall be borne by the offeror and will not be charged to the Government for reimbursement.  At this time any responses received as a result of this notice will be used for market research and informational purposes only. 

The Air Force Research Laboratorys (AFRL) Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/RV) and Directed Energy Directorate (AFRL/RD) are seeking small business sources capable of providing Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) to support research and development in the advancement of directed energy and space technologies primarily at Kirtland AFB, NM and Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.  The effort will include professional engineering and management services necessary to ensure AFRL/RV and AFRL/RD can continue to develop state-of-the-art technologies to advance high performance operational systems with sustained operational reliability to meet the warfighters requirements.  Specifically, the AFRL directorates are requiring strategic planning support to ensure they maintain proper technology.  Both Directorates require professional support for organizational policy development, decision making, and, management services for research and development activities.  These services may take the form of information, advice, opinions, alternatives, studies, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, training, and technical services.

The scope of this work shall encompass professional services for: strategic and technology planning, for space, directed energy, homeland defense, and missile defense technologies; business and leadership development for space, directed energy, and missile defense technologies; integration of space, directed energy, and missile defense technology developments with future Air Force Major Command needs; identification and integration of defense and first responder technologies for homeland defense (as it relates to space and directed energy technologies); cooperative requirements and technology planning with the National Aeronautics and Space Administrations space technology development centers; and technical analysis and management support of joint technology development programs with the Missile Defense Agency, High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office and the Operationally Responsive Space Office.  The effort will encompass planning, coordinating and evaluating development and/or production of systems/subsystems/technologies to meet cost, schedule, and performance criteria as well as the ability to plan, analyze, and evaluate engineering and technical efforts used to define total weapons system/subsystem/technology requirements.  In addition, the services of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) may be required on a full time, part time or temporary basis to review the status of on-going programs, provide recommendations for redirection of existing or establishment of new programs, and develop and/or deliver information (in the form of briefings, papers, participation in meetings, etc.) to higher level AF, DOD and other organizations.  SMEs must be highly qualified (based on experience and/or education) and have high professional standing within the community of interest.  For some tasks within this effort, the scope may also require planning support to groups (i.e., committees, teams, panels, working groups, etc.), which may include, but is not limited to:  1) organizing, hosting, running, and documenting meetings;  and  2) document and data preparation, presentation, and archiving.

Potential contractors will need to be familiar with the technology challenges imposed to meet the needs of AFRL/RV in the areas of Responsive Space, Defensive Space Control, Space Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, Space Communications and Satellite Control, Space Situational Awareness, and Counterspace.  In addition, contractors will need to be familiar with directed energy technologies such as laser, high power microwave, and optics and imaging to meet the challenges required for Force Protection, Long Range Strike, Precision Engagement, Counter Electronics, and Space Control.

The deliverables for the effort are technical analysis reports, strategic planning documents, technical consultation, and senior financial advice on space and directed energy technology investment strategies, analysis to identify potential space and directed energy business development opportunities and methods for pursuing these opportunities, interfacing directly with the various Major Commands, System Program Offices, academias or commercial industrys plans and programs offices and leadership to provide strategic consultation on future space or directed energy systems taking into account projected science and technology advances; and studies to evaluate the payoff of emerging, developing, and current technologies for application to advanced space and directed energy systems.

This contractor is the only known source that can meet the needs of the pharmacy.

Without a cost-effective means of accomplishing this, hydrocarbon resources cannot be used freely. A few power plants currently remove carbon dioxide from flue gas for sale as an industrial product. Oil companies commonly remove carbon dioxide from natural gas to improve its energy content. In both cases, the most common technology is a temperature-swing absorption (TSA) using a methylated ethyl amine solvent (MEA). </span></p>

This increases the vapor pressure of carbon dioxide gas, permitting carbon dioxide to be removed from the downstream side of the ion pump as a pure gas. The ion pumping may be obtained from reverse osmosis, electrodialysis, or the Cussler ion pump.</span></p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source basis with Thomson Reuters (Scientific), Inc. 3501 Market Street Philadelphia, PA, for the purchase of an upgrade to NISTs Thomson IP Manager software.  Thomson Reuters holds the copyright to that software. Upgrades must come from them since no other database software system is compatible with their system, and Thomson Reuters does not allow any other companies to provide such upgrades. Therefore, Thomson Reuters is the only company that can provide NIST with the upgrades required.
The Government intends to solicit only this one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) because the Government has not identified any other sources that can meet the requirements specified above. Interested concerns may identify their capabilities to provide the Thomson IP Manager upgrade by submitting a capability statement that clearly and unambiguously demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to provide this software. Capability statements may be e-mailed to Barbara.Suhrie@nist.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is not a request for quotation. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>(i) IDENTIFICATION OF AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: This document constitutes a limited source justification for the acquisition described below and is executed on behalf of the Nation Park Service, Northeast Regional Contract Office.
(ii) NATURE AND DESCRIPTION OF ACTION: The National Park Service Northeast Regional Office proposes to issue a delivery order utilizing FSS 711-7 for the procurement of High-Density Moveable Shelf Filing Systems for the Statue of Liberty National Monument/Ellis Island ImmigrationMuseum.
(iii) DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: The Museum Services Division of the Statue of Liberty National Monument/Ellis Island received approval of PMIS Project No. 116065 entitled "Expand Archival Storage in the Ellis Island Immigration Museum."  To accomplish this end, additional High-Density Mobile Shelf Filing Systems are required and the additional shelving will be added to the existing shelving. Consequently the additional shelving must be compatible with existing shelving currently in use in the Museum. Estimated value of this proposed action is $68,727.15.
(iv) IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE AND, IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S  UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE: Pursuant to FAR 8.405(6)(b)(i) only one responsible source is capable of responding due to the unique/specialized nature of the work. The contractor, Modern Office Systems of New York City, installed the existing compact shelving in the library area of the Museum several years ago using equipment manufactured by Space Saver Corporation. Modern Office Systems is the authorized representative for Space Saver Corporation products in the New York City area. 
The moveable shelving units run on metal rails installed in the floor and are stabilized against tipping by metal runner bars attached to the tops of the shelving units. Because such compact shelving increases the weight per square foot of flooring, the floor in the storage area had to be reinforced. The existing track system was installed with room for expansion and covers the remaining portion of the reinforced floor. It is on this existing track, which was constructed specifically for expansion, that the additional shelves will be mounted.    This procurement proposes to use products made by Space Saver Corporation, which have been deemed the only products compatible with the existing storage configurations, and have the equipment installed by Modern Office Systems, the authorized company representative in the area.     
(v) DETERMINATION THAT THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 8.404(d): The Market Research described below was unable to identify other providers/manufacturers of compatible shelving units. Space Saver Corporation has a current GSA Contract No. GS-28F-1003C to provide the exact types of additional shelving units/equipment required by the requsitioning activity that are compatible with existing units. GSA has determined the prices of supplies under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable in accordance with Far 8.404(d). 
(vi) MARKET RESEARCH: A market survey was conducted for this proposed action. Two firms, Burroughs Corporation and Metropolitan Office Systems, were contacted since both firms provide similar products and have GSA Contracts. Burroughs Corporation manufactures a line of mobile shelving called "Aisle Saver" while Metropolitan Office Systems deals with several lines of mobile shelving including "Aurora Mobile" and "Datum". Neither firm could provide products that would be compatible with the existing shelving/floor rails manufactured by Space Saver Corporation and would therefore would not be able to submit a quote if formally solicited. 
(vii) ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS: There was a substantial cost involved with the reinforcement of the floor in the Museum Library to handle the original shelving and room for expansion. The continued use of compact shelving systems, such as the one manufactured by Space Saver Corporation, preserves as much of the limited available  floor space as possible, is able to use the existing floor-mounted rails and allows the National Park Service to continue to reap the long-term benefits from the cost of the original reinforcement/expansion effort.
(viii) ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO COMPETITION: The existence of floor rails for expansion of the shelving in the Library mandates using a system that is compatible with those rails as well as the existing shelving.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Health Revenue Center, Topeka, KS intends to award a sole source contract to expand its existing telecommunication capabilities to Black Box Network Services of Amityville, New York.  The Government intends to award this contract IAW FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(C) (1). The DVA HRC presently operates several nationwide call centers with the primary mission to provide various support services to current and former veterans and their spouses. The DVA made award in September of 2005 to SDV Telecommunications of Grass Valley, California under competitive proposals received in response to the RFP for replacement of the existing PBX system and associated upgrades.

Scope of work includes upgrading the PRI and T1 capability of the NEC 2400 IPX switch, installation, project management, software configuration and related services. The VA HRC believes NuVision Technologies DBA Black Box Network Services to be the only source that can provide the required hardware and software and successfully integrate to maintain compatibility and functionality of the original system without substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition. This is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to meet these requirements. Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination to conduct a competitive procurement will be at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer. Phone inquiries will not be accepted. Responses related to this notice shall be in writing and must be received no later than September 08, 2008. POC Barry Fetzer, DVA HRC, 3401 SW 21, Bldg 9, Topeka, KS 66604 Barry.fetzer@va.gov . The value of this acquisition is below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. This is a simplified acquisition.*****

<p>Duties and Responsibilities:</p>
<p>Major Duties of this position include:</p>
<p>Under the guidance of the CDC Country Director and the Senior Technical Advisor for Strategic Information (SI), the primary responsibility of the Surveillance epidemiologist is to develop HIV/AIDS activities and programs in Mozambique as defined in the PEPFAR Country Operations Plan. The SE will work at a project management level to coordinate the design, implementation, and strengthening of surveillance systems and health surveys related to HIV/AIDS. At a technical level, incumbent ensures appropriate, high quality implementation of these systems and surveys. The SE also works with USG partners at both implementer and national levels to quantify progress towards targets set for the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).</p>
<p>Develops and monitors the PEPFAR-funded survey portfolio, and tracks other health surveys of particular interest to CDC-Mozambique. Incumbent serves as the primary point of contact for information related to design, partners, timelines, funding, and results of surveys, and works with the SI team to develop plans for new surveys to meet the strategic information needs of the USG and the country. Incumbent may provide direct project management and technical assistance to surveys which, due to their complex nature or large scale, require it. Incumbent also manages one or more fellows providing survey management support for specific surveys. Incumbent will also work closely with CDC staff across HIV/AIDS technical areas supported by CDC to ensure that data generated by USG-supported surveys and by the MOH surveillance systems are useful and used for program planning, policy development, advocacy, and impact evaluation. Incumbent coordinates maintenance and development of the USG GIS system, based on surveillance and survey data. During specific periods of the year, incumbent aids in completion of the USG Country Operation Plan and the Semi-Annual and Annual Reports, as they relate to surveillance and survey activities.<br />Coordinates capacity-building within the MOH so as to implement and strengthen HIV, STI, and mortality surveillance systems, and provides technical assistance to the MOH to support systems development and data analysis. As the primary point of contact for surveillance and survey activities within the USG mission, incumbent closely coordinates activities with other donors, with counterparts at UN agencies and other multilateral organizations, and with non-PEPFAR partners so as to avoid duplication of efforts.</p>
<p>Provides technical assistance to the MOH, the Multisectoral Technical Group, and other agencies, with respect to analysis and interpretation of HIV survey and surveillance data. Coordinates technical assistance from CDC Atlanta and other partners to improve capacity building within NAC, MOH, and other domestic organizations so as to better analyze and integrate data describing the HIV epidemic and the national response.</p>
<p>Provides general technical program support to the Strategic Information Team to help with completion of USG reports and documents, such as the Country Operation Plan and the Semi-Annual and Annual Reports.</p>
<p>Incumbent, on occasion, supports and manages contracts for services related to survey and surveillance activities, such as contracting logistics, project management or data entry activities to local companies. Incumbent may also support larger centrally procured contracts.</p>
<p>Provides training on methods used in the collection and use of epidemiological survey and surveillance data. This training may also be provided to new staff at PEPFAR-funded organizations, as needed.</p>
<p>Incumbent meets with and organizes activities for members of MOH, National Statistics Institute, and multi-agency teams assigned to assess high-level, technical or very specific areas and issues.<br />Provides guidance on allocation of tasks for 1 GAP fellow working in Strategic Information area, and for administrative personnel who are providing assistance to projects that the incumbent manages, such as procurement or secretarial duties.<br />As a member of the PEPFAR Mozambique Technical Working Group on Strategic Information, the Surveillance Epidemiologist will be required to provide daily work guidance to resident and TDY support staff for technical assistance consultancies.</p>
<p>Incumbent is provided with equipment necessary to perform his/her duties, including a personal computer (PC) with all relevant software and hardware, internet, fax machine, photocopier, digital scanner, and desk. Will be a user of the equipment. ($5,000).</p>
<p>Normal expendable supplies will be provided by the CDC/GAP office on a regular and ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Incumbent helps prepare supporting budgetary documentation for procurements of contracted services. Incumbent oversees the CDC budget for surveillance and survey activities, which could range from $2,500,000-$5,000,000.</p>
<p>Incumbent is responsible for maintaining print and electronic archives on Strategic Information activities and reporting indicators and other surveillance data for periodic monthly, quarterly or annual reports. Incumbent also maintains files on relevant surveillance and survey activities from year to year for detailed PEPFAR reporting for analysis and development of narrative reports. These data will be filed or stored to facilitate ready access on any given indicator and for partner activities.<br /><br />Incumbent also is responsible for maintaining secure access to survey data when protocols allow or require CDC to participate in data analysis activities, including appropriate access control and archival activities.</p>
<p>Incumbent, on occasion, supports and manages contracts for services related to survey and surveillance activities, such as contracting logistics, project management or data entry activities to local companies. Incumbent may also support larger centrally procured contracts.</p>
<p>Incumbent reports to the CDC/GAP direct hire SI Coordinator and has a great deal of latitude in determining daily routines and activities. Incumbent usually receives general guidance on overall section goals and priority determinations that, in some cases, may have been dictated by the GAP director or from the Atlanta HQ or Washington level. Employee will then proceed with developing individual work plans toward those goals. Employee must also work with various groups and participate in high-level interagency meetings and committees as a technical expert contributing independent comments, judgments and conclusions.</p>
<p>Incumbent has significant independence to execute the duties described in the position description. This independence requires regular communications to be initiated with partners and other agencies without specific direction or consent given by the supervisor. Individual thought and action to take the initiative in proposing plans or a given course of action is encouraged, and incumbent may, at times, oppose or veto the actions of others when those actions would contradict or run counter to established guidelines governing the collection or dissemination of this data.</p>
<p>An important part of the responsibilities of this position is problem resolution and determining the best approach to take individually or as a group to resolve problems or situations encountered, whether it is an epidemiologic approach or a data collection dilemma. Incumbent acts independently to determine sequence and priority of work over a period of days. Within usual work situations, incumbent will be expected to solve and address problems independently as they arise to assure that the project work is completed in accordance with approved guidelines and directed toward PEPFAR goals.</p>
<p>The duties of incumbent, including project oversight, require working closely with in-house staff and multiple partners external to the organization (e.g., USG- and non-USG-funded agencies, other multi- and bilateral donors.) Incumbent does not control the overall management or implementation of projects, though the sphere of influence and range of assistance provided to individuals and numerous agencies is significant.</p>
<p>Incumbent makes recommendations regarding mechanisms and partners for COP planning regarding survey activities. Incumbent may decide to contract short-term staff, where appropriate, for data entry or other activities related to surveys and surveillance.</p>
<p>Besides the above-described participation in surveillance and program planning at various levels, job holder facilitates and leads Multisectoral Working Groups with government and partner agency staff that decides upon and supports national survey programs. Job holder provides technical consultation and advice on the progress and the impact of the implementation and is the primary point of contact for all CDC and PEPFAR-funded surveillance and survey activities. Incumbent provides specific and relevant advice and recommendations to others inside and outside of the CDC/GAP country office, including the identification of partners and mechanisms that can be used to complete required surveillance activities. Incumbent also coordinates technical assistance from CDC headquarters in response to requests for surveillance and survey assistance from partners.</p>
<p>The Surveillance Epidemiologist provides regular progress reports to the CDC/GAP country director, deputy and the six section chiefs in the office. Progress reports on partner activities allow staff to assess the degree to which CDC and PEPFAR are able to evaluate the impact of their programs. Incumbent provides specific and relevant advice and recommendations, as well as information on changes to surveillance requirements and information on partners experiencing technical difficulties collecting or transmitting required data. Incumbent also coordinates technical assistance from CDC HQ in response to requests for such assistance from partners. Incumbent ensures that information, such as national HIV prevalence estimates, is available to CDC and PEPFAR managers.</p>
<p>Incumbent spends a great deal of time and works closely with MOH project staff and other organizations funded by PEPFAR. It is a major responsibility of the position to work closely with and provide technical support to external partners in each of the individual projects. The success of these collaborative activities is highly dependent on the ability of the job holder to develop these bonds and to forge links that positively impact USG-funded cooperative agreement activities. Job holder ensures that data necessary to evaluate the impact of PEPFAR programs, such as national HIV prevalence estimates, is made available to partners on a timely basis.</p>
<p><br />Knowledge:</p>
<p>Essential</p>
<p>Knowledge of monitoring and evaluation, epidemiological surveillance, and complex survey methods through training and job experience is required. Knowledge of routine health information systems in developing countries, and knowledge of HIV reporting systems required.</p>
<p>Masters level training in public health, public policy, epidemiology, demography, or related health field required.</p>
<p>Two years work experience in developing epidemiological surveillance and/or large-scale surveys of HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, or care programs is required.</p>
<p>Three years additional work experience including at least two years previous supervisory experience is required.</p>
<p>Must have excellent communication skills in English, written/verbal and diplomacy. Level IV (fluent) English is required. Demonstrable competence in written and verbal Portuguese required.</p>
<p>Must have advanced skill levels in use of data analysis software packages and excellent overall computer skills. Must have some experience with designing databases and data entry systems.</p>
<p>Desired</p>
<p>Knowledge of general Ministry of Health strategies, guidelines and procedures for HIV programs in Sub-Saharan Africa desirable.<br />Knowledge of relevant cultural context and local beliefs that may facilitate or hinder successful program implementation desirable.<br />Knowledge of epidemiology of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa and Mozambique desirable.</p>
<p>PhD level training in public health, public policy, epidemiology, demography, or related health field desired.</p>
<p>Previous experience in providing training and/or mentorship in the field of strategic information and/or informatics at an individual and group level is desirable.<br />Experience working on strategic information with one or more international agency systems in Southern Africa, preferably with USG or UN agencies, is desirable.</p>
<p>Advanced experience with at least one of following is desirable: EPIINFO, STATA, SAS, or SPSS data analysis software.</p>
<p><br />Intellectual Skills:</p>
<p>Incumbent works in a highly detailed and complex information environment. Incumbent also must have strong knowledge, skills and abilities in the field of HIV/AIDS epidemiological surveillance. Reporting guidelines are updated routinely and incumbent will be expected to keep up with changes in the reporting guidelines and communicate these changes to partners, as needed. Incumbent also is expected to stay current with developments in the field of HIV surveillance.</p>
<p>More generally, job holder must know and understand specialized, technical public health information, including:<br />1. Policies on HIV surveillance at the international and national levels;<br />2. Guidelines, instructions, manuals and technical journals indicated for surveillance activities at national and project levels;<br />3. Standard guidelines and instructions for developing and managing epidemiologic surveillance and survey protocols; and,<br />4. Statistical expertise to allow sufficient understanding of surveillance and survey data, to the extent that incumbent must provide technical reviews, revisions and updates for the MOH, Multisectoral Technical Group, and CDC.</p>
<p>The Surveillance Epidemiologist position is complex, requiring the incumbent to cover multiple projects within different implementing partner organizations, and participate on multiple technical bodies within host government and donor institutions. The position requires in-depth analysis and determination of best options in order to meet organizational objectives. These analyses will be quantitative and qualitative in nature, as required for the annual and semi-annual reports, the Country Operational Plan (COP), UNAIDS surveillance and UNGASS reporting.</p>
<p>Problems encountered by incumbent may vary significantly among the range of projects, and considerable judgment and analysis is required to reach appropriate resolutions. Incumbent must, for example, assist MOH and partners who encounter difficulties collecting, sending or using data to support program planning and evaluation.</p>
<p>This person must be able to work quickly and accurately under significant time constraints. There are many programs that require support and incumbent is expected to prioritize activities according to the severity of the identified problems and then to work closely with partners to resolve those problems.</p>
<p>Detailed plans for project activities must be conceptualized well in advance and indicators developed to collect specific data from project activities before activities ever actually begin. This requires a great deal of forward planning and coordination with other CDC staff and with MOH staff. Incumbent is a major contributor to the development of the Country Operational Plan (COP) with regard to M&amp;E planning and actively involved in the ongoing analysis and revision of the documents that outline program goals and objectives for the fiscal year. This entire process involves scheduling carefully and accurately for activities that will occur anywhere from 1-3 years in advance. Incumbent contributes to COP sections involving M&amp;E activities and also advises the CDC/GAP senior technical staff on monitoring and evaluation issues as they pertain to the development of long-term strategic planning documents.</p>
<p>Incumbent is expected to proactively seek opportunities for program improvements that may include the development and implementation of new or revised strategies and interventions. Incumbent is expected to keep abreast of new developments and innovations in the field; also is expected to contribute new ideas, and adapt techniques and procedures as required by CDC and PEPFAR. Innovations are particularly important with regard to the design and implementation of national surveys in order to respond to changing indicator needs or logistical and ethical considerations emerging from CDC, PEPFAR, or UNAIDS.</p>
<p><br />Communications:</p>
<p>Incumbent has direct internal contact with all members of the CDC/GAP staff, especially with other technical sections, inasmuch as much of the work is programmatically cross-cutting. Communications cover many topics but revolve around how to meet surveillance needs, how to ensure implementation of critical surveys, and how to interpret results. Incumbent is expected to approach key internal contacts (chief of party, deputy director for programs, deputy director) and communicate mission critical information to them in a timely and clear manner. The clarity of the specifics and the preciseness of expression are highly important to the position's successful performance, and often complex information must be conveyed in convincing and meaningful fashion to individuals such as country directors of USG agencies, as well as senior staff at the MOH or the U.S. Embassy.</p>
<p>As a point of contact for surveillance and surveys, incumbent maintains regular, ongoing contact with all external partners and serves as the CDC technical liaison on relevant panels and committees. This contact includes communication with high- and mid-level representatives of the MOH, INE, GTM and other partner organizations. These contacts involve sharing information on guidelines for surveillance and surveys, support for the collection and submission of required indicator data, and analysis and interpretation of available data.</p>
<p>Job holder is required to demonstrate well developed oral communication skills on a regular and ongoing basis in both English and Portuguese. Successful performance of the position's duties requires highly developed skills for the transfer of routine information explaining the concepts and importance of HIV indicator data. Incumbent must be able to communicate highly technical information to senior staff on the USG team as well as with partner organizations. Complex explanations must be presented clearly and concisely, and incumbent must be able to restate the same information from different perspectives. This ability will be essential for partners who may not grasp the initial explanation of a new and complex set of guidelines or data activities. Incumbent often must show tact and diplomacy in discussing the results of sensitive matters (HIV/AIDS information, project funding and impact indicators, for example) to many different individuals with differing levels of understanding of the issues. Incumbent often is faced with providing detailed explanations about disease surveillance program information and indicators to assure complete understanding or in some cases to take specific courses of action without having the authority to compel them toward a particular decision. Incumbent will make frequent presentations to gain and hold the attention of and to impart knowledge to a group of people.</p>
<p>Job holder is expected to write very high quality documents and reports based on analyses of data collected by numerous projects. These may be written for presentation at international conferences or submitted for publication in international journals and require logical thinking and original thought on a routine basis. Written work includes contributions to the annual Country Operational Plan, annual and semi-annual reports, host government technical reports such as the ANC surveillance, demographic impact, and data triangulation reports, as well as training materials, as assigned by incumbent's supervisor. Incumbent also is expected to produce high level presentation slides, including information collected during the most recent reporting cycle. Particularly in the initial stages of project implementation and/or with the position's development and evolution, incumbent develops interview questionnaires, protocols, written procedures, or manuals and guidelines, and revisions later on, for surveillance and survey activities. These written communications may be required in English or Portuguese for use by CDC/GAP staff as well as implementing partners and usually contain technical, conceptual and complex details. They must be sufficiently well-written to be understood by senior members of the U.S. mission, senior leadership at CDC/GAP headquarters in Atlanta, and senior staff at the Departments of State and HHS in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Working Environment:</p>
<p>This position is assigned to the CDC/GAP office in Maputo. Regular visits to MOH and partner organizations are expected and more travel to remote project sites throughout Mozambique is required than in other project officer-type positions in the CDC office.</p>
<p>Incumbent will be exposed more often to common hazards related to travel in the area, such as malaria, but none that other CDC staff members are not subjected to as well.</p>
<p>Job is primarily sedentary, but may be somewhat stressful in terms of long hours, meetings in the evenings or weekend work requirements and short deadlines at times. Occasional fieldwork supervision may require visiting remote survey clusters on foot, and camping.</p>
<p>Travel of up to 25% outside of Maputo is expected.</p>
<p><br />Benefits/Allowances:</p>
<p>Overseas allowances and differentials similar to those available to U.S. Government employees assigned abroad may be payable under this PSC, subject to eligibility.

<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One Base Year and Four Option Years</p>
<p>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Maputo, Mozambique</p>
<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE: NACI (Non-sensitive)</p>
<p>AREA OF CONSIDERATION: United States Citizens and residents and third country nationals. Citizens and permanent residents of the host country are not eligible for this position.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities: <br />The designated PEPFAR/Mozambique Interagency Coordinator is subject to approval by the Chief of Mission (Ambassador) and incumbent reports to the Chief of Mission or his/her designee.<br />Incumbent assumes responsibility for coordinating critical communications between and among various USG departments and agencies (USAID, CDC, State, DOD, etc.) involved in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The Ambassador heads the PEPFAR program and is the final decision-maker with input from the Executive Team, which is comprised of Agency Leads and Branch Chiefs. First-line supervision of this position is assigned to the Charg&eacute; d'Affaires or Ambassador. As such, incumbent represents the Charg&eacute; d'Affaires or Ambassador in sensitively and collaboratively managing the complex processes associated with planning for, implementing, and monitoring the results of the Emergency Plan across the participating USG implementing agencies. The employing agency, or its agent, manages administrative requirements (personnel files, payroll, etc.). The country coordinator supervises the non-direct hire staff in the Coordinator's office.<br />Background<br />The PEPFAR initiative is the largest commitment given by a nation toward an international health initiative for a single disease. It is a five-year, $15 billion, multifaceted approach to combating the HIV/AIDS in more than 100 countries around the world. The strategy places an intensified approach on 15 focus countries in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia that represent approximately half the world's infections. The goal of PEPFAR is to treat two million HIV-infected individuals, prevent seven million new infections, and provide care and support for 10 million HIV-infected and affected adults and children. In Mozambique, PEPFAR is implemented primarily by the following U.S. Government agencies: the Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with contributions from the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of State (DOS) and the Peace Corps.</p>
<p>The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is providing unprecedented resources to help Mozambique implement its national HIV/AIDS plan and save thousands of lives. The estimated 2004 adult HIV prevalence rate of 16% is below rates in some nearby countries, but unlike for other countries in the region continues to increase in particular in the Southern part of the country. Increasing development and mobility are likely to fuel the spread of the disease. Post's funding has grown dramatically, from a small U.S. program in FY 2003 to a proposed $228 million in FY 2008. This dramatic increase in funding has required a requisite increase in personnel to expand the number of people treated and the care provided for those affected as well as post's expanding efforts to build health care capacity and prevent new infections. Working with the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC), the mission has set ambitious targets and made considerable progress to-date. Post anticipates that, going forward, funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) will remain at approximately the FY 2008 level.</p>
<p>To reach Emergency Plan targets in Mozambique requires dynamic coordination and strong leadership skills. Working under the direction of the Chief of Mission (COM)/Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM), the PEPFAR Coordinator ("the Coordinator") oversees and coordinates the activities of the USG PEPFAR Country Team in planning and implementing the PEPFAR program. The Coordinator works closely with and under the direction of the COM/DCM in these efforts. In addition, s/he is expected to be responsive and accountable to the PEPFAR Mozambique Principals. The Principals Group is comprised of agency leads and branch chiefs whose role is to provide broad policy and strategic direction for implementation of the Emergency Plan, including compliance with guidance and earmarks from the OGAC, as well as maximum congruence with priorities of the host govt.<br />Major Duties of this position include:</p>
<p>General Principles<br />&bull; Incumbent is the primary point of contact with the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator and is the coordinator of activities related to the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (the Emergency Plan/PEPFAR) in the Country. This position plays a critical role in the planning, implementation, and reporting of program performance of inter-agency programs. The role of the Coordinator is essential as the size and complexity of the program grows.<br />&bull; The Ambassador heads the in-country PEPFAR program and is the final decision maker under PEPFAR Guidance for all program plans and activities submitted to the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator for approval.<br />&bull; The Coordinator is a facilitator, a communicator, and at times, a negotiator. The Coordinator is, in general, not a technical director, although the Coordinator may be expected on occasion to ensure follow-up on implementation of technical recommendations based on the Country Operational Plan (COP) and other performance review information. When delegated this authority by the Ambassador, the Coordinator may represent PEPFAR with external partners including government, press, and others. Agency leads may also be expected to play a role in public diplomacy based on authority delegated by the Ambassador.<br />&bull; The Mozambique PEPFAR team has established an Interagency Principals Group as well as an Interagency Task Force, comprised of senior technical and management staff from all USG agencies. Incumbent is a member of the Mozambique Principals Group as well as the in-country PEPFAR Task Force. The Coordinator facilitates communications between these two levels as well as helps setting up the agenda, prepares relevant documents and hand-outs for meetings, produces and disseminates minutes of meetings. The Coordinator is accountable to ensure these two groups meet regularly and work towards achieving their objectives. <br />&bull; Agency leads should be copied on communications between the Coordinator and technical teams or staff as well as on substantive communications between the Coordinator and the core team lead in headquarters. This procedure is essential to retain trust and respect between agency leads and the Coordinator. In addition, it is critical that the Coordinator be copied on internal agency communication related to matters of PEPFAR program strategy, implementation, and management and staffing.<br />&bull; Incumbent may represent the agencies at official meetings. When incumbent meets with host Government counterparts, s/he should include agency leads or, if not possible, consult with agency leads.<br />&bull; The Coordinator, in collaboration with the Mozambique Interagency Reporting Specialist, serves as the lead in development of the COP, Semi-Annual Performance Review (SAPR), and Annual Performance Review (APR). The final SAPR, APR and COP will be submitted only after approval of the Mozambique Principals and final approval by the Ambassador/Charg&eacute; d'Affaires.<br />&bull; The Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that reports are submitted to Washington in a timely fashion, for organizing the logistical arrangements for inter-agency work, and for keeping agencies on task for inter-agency efforts.<br />Supervision:<br />First-line supervision of this position is assigned to the DCM or Ambassador. As such, the incumbent represents the DCM or Ambassador in sensitively and collaboratively managing the complex processes associated with planning for, implementing, and monitoring the results of the Emergency Plan across the participating USG implementing agencies. CDC, as the employing agency, will manage administrative requirements (personnel files, formal evaluation procedures, payroll, security clearance, etc.) <br />In addition to the personnel evaluation procedures of the employing agency, CDC, and its agent, the DCM will obtain a "360 degree" evaluation seeking the perspectives of: at least one representative of each USG implementing agency, directly supervised staff involved in coordinating the Emergency Plan in the host country, and key host government interlocutors at least annually. The results of the "360 degree" evaluation will be shared with both the Country Coordinator and the Ambassador and will serve as the basis for determining whether to exercise incumbent's employment contract option.</p>

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. (ii) The solicitation number is FDA-SOL-08-1043888. 
(iii)This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-26.
 (iv)The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 a small business size standard of 500 employees.

(v) The DHHS FDA Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services requires the following items, Brand Name or Equal, to the following:

 Description of item:  Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner  CGCS3000 7G System: Description of requirement:  WORK STATEMENT:  SPECIFICATIONS: 

4.1 The instrumentation must include all pieces of specialized, fully integrated equipment necessary for conducting whole genome microarray assays that are not general laboratory equipment and that are all compatible with the same format of high-density microarray.  The integrated instrumentation needs to include a microarray scanner, fluidics station, hybridization oven, and computer workstation with operating system software. 

4.2 The instrumentation must be compatible with high density microarrays for gene expression analysis of tissues from laboratory animal species routinely used for preclinical toxicology studies, including the rat, mouse, pig, and dog.

 4.3 The instrumentation must be compatible with high density microarrays available from commercial sources. 
 
4.4. The microarray scanner must include a solid-state laser that can produce high resolution fluorescence scans at submicron level pixel resolution or a detection system with equivalent resolution.  The fluidics station must automatically process multiple microarrays at a time, with precision delivery of washing and staining solutions.  The hybridization oven must process at least 20 arrays at a time, with a precision of 0.5C at the calibration set point and an operating range from 30 to 60C.  The computer workstation must be preloaded with (1) operating system software for the scanner and fluidics station, (2) annotations for all commercially available versions of the manufacturers microarrays, (3) software for microarray quality control analysis, and (4) software for different signal extraction algorithms.   The order must include installation, training, instruction manuals, and one-year warranty. Training in use of software and equipment for up to 5 people at a government site.  

(1) Vendors are expected to submit literature supporting their data quality based on results in "transparent, peer-reviewed comparisons involving multiple laboratories and platforms, such as those conducted by the MicroArray Quality Consortium and published in Nature Biotechnology 24, 1151-1161 (2006).  The required level of technical consistency could be demonstrated by coefficient of variations of 7.5% or less of quantitative signal values between intrasite and intersite replicates.  The required level of accuracy could be demonstrated by good correlation (r2 &#8805; 0.90) of log2 ratios with data generated using polymerase chain reaction technology such as TaqMan."

4.5. The equipment must generate data comparable to the quality of data that we have previously generated on Affymetrix microarrays for on-going division programs on cardiac and skeletal muscle toxicity.  The data must be comparable because these studies cannot be repeated without prohibitive cost to the agency (estimated at over $25,000) due to the expensive nature of the consumables (enzymatic labeling kits and microarrays). 
 
(1) For vendors that meet all the requirements / specifications set forth in the statement of work, systems will be ranked on the demonstrated level of technical consistency and accuracy in transparent, peer-reviewed comparisons involving multiple laboratories and platforms, such as those conducted by the MicroArray Quality Consortium and published in Nature Biotechnology 24, 1151-1161 (2006).  The measurements to be reported are the coefficients of variation of quantitative signal values between intrasite and intersite replicates and the Pearson correlation coefficients (for log2 ratios) with data generated using polymerase chain reaction technology such as TaqMan.   Selection between vendors that demonstrate equivalent levels of technical consistency will be based on the system cost. 

4.6. The equipment must meet projected program needs by possessing the capacity to conduct genotyping assays or high density gene mapping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or be upgradable to that capacity. 

4.7. The instrumentation for expression analysis must not require the filtering and monitoring of laboratory air for ozone levels in order to achieve optimal performance because that would require costly modifications to our current laboratory structure.

<DESC><p>This is a combined sysnopsis / solicitation for NOAA, Marine Engineering Division located in Seattle, WA for winter moorage services for two 9@) NOAA vessels, for the period of November 1, 2008 to March 31, 2009. Services to be provided:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. BACKGROUND - As a result of fire damage to the piers at the Marine Operations<br />Center- Pacific, 1801 Fairview Ave East Seattle, Wash 98102, The NOAA vessels home<br />ported in Seattle (not to exceed 235ft in length each, with a maximum draft of 20ft)<br />require an alternate moorage facility for the period from November I, 2008 to March 1,<br />2009. (4 months). During this period, moorage of two NOAA vessels such as Miller<br />Freeman and Rainier shall be required. During the moorage period, vessel repairs by<br />private contractors shall be accomplished under separate NOAA acquisitions. This<br />acquisition is for moorage only.<br />2. REQUIREMENTS - Respondents to this acquisition shall provide NOAA moorage<br />for the entire performance period for up to two vessels. Offerors shall submit invoices for<br />moorage on a monthly basis.<br />A. Power and Water - Respondents shall assume in submitting quotations for this<br />acquisition that power and water shall be separately and directly billed to the<br />vessels. The moorage facility shall have power and water available and ready for<br />use by the ships as of November 01, 2008.<br />B. Sewer and Steam - Will be provided by the Government by portable boiler(s) and<br />portable shore side holding tanks at the Government's expense. The Government<br />shall arrange for these services separately.<br />C. Security - Respondents shall assume that NOAA shall provide security at the<br />ship's brow controlling access to the vessels. Respondents shall identify in their<br />offer any additional security they provide at their facility.<br />D. Parking - The facility offered shall have sufficient parking to accommodate 40<br />Personnel, 20 per ship plus contractor parking for repair contractors and visiting<br />OAA employees for a total of fifty (50) spaces.<br />E. Special Requirements - The facility offered shall have significant outdoor lay<br />down and pier side work areas for contractor tools, equipment and bulk storage as<br />well as space for portable boiler(s) and sewage holding tanks. There shall be<br />roughly minimum of one thousand (1000) square feet per ship.<br />3. FORESEEABLE COSTS - Submitted quotations will be assessed foreseeable costs.<br />Foreseeable costs are the costs incurred by the Government that are related to the<br />location of the Contractor's moorage/repair facility. These costs may be applicable to<br />all submitted quotations.<br />The assessment of foreseeable costs will be conducted by adding the additional costs<br />incurred by the Government due to mooring vessels outside the local commuting area<br />of the ships' homeport. For purposes of this procurement, the ships' homeport will be<br />assumed to be 180I Fairview Ave. East, Seattle, Washington, otherwise known as the<br />NOAA Marine Operations Center Pacific.<br />(Please Note: Foreseeable Costs will be applied to bids for bid evaluation<br />purposes only and use of this exercise does not constitute additional payment to<br />the contractor.)<br />A. Costs Assessed For Crew Complement<br />1. Travel<br />Crew Travel cost is included when the contractor's facility is more than fifty<br />(50) miles from the Marine Operations Center Pacific. Crew travel cost will<br />be calculated on the basis of the rental of one (I) fifteen (15) passenger van<br />per ship for transporting crew members to the ship located outside of the<br />Seattle commuting area for the entire moorage period.<br />Additionally, for the ship's Officers, mileage for travel will be applied for two<br />(2) additional transits per day per ship for the moorage period. The mileage<br />rate will be that in use by federal travel regulations and is currently 48.5 cents<br />per mile.<br />2. Lodging and Subsistence<br />For purposes of computing lodging, it is assumed that the vessel will not be<br />habitable for thirty (30) calendar days of the moorage period. Only during<br />this time will lodging be required for fifteen (15) vessel personnel who are<br />required on site during the ship moorage period. For purposes of computing<br />subsistence, it is assumed the galley will be closed for thirty (30) days during<br />the performance period. Only during this time will subsistence be required for<br />fifteen (15) vessel personnel who are required during the ship moorage period.<br />Crew lodging and subsistence cost calculation: costs will be calculated upon<br />opening of individual contractor quotations and will be based on the most<br />recent union agreement applicable to NOAA shipboard wage marine personnel<br />but may be adjusted upward if no comparable lodging rates are available in the<br />geographic location of the moorage facility. However, adjusted rates shall not,<br />in any case, exceed the current Government per diem rates established for the<br />location of the moorage facility.<br />B. Costs Assessed for Necessary Marine Center Support Personnel<br />Support costs described below will be assessed to the offeror's quotations for<br />offers outside the commuting area of the Marine Operations Center Pacific for<br />civilian employees required on site during the moorage period.<br />A Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) and NOAA<br />electronics technicians (ET's) will be required on site during the entire<br />moorage period as vessel repairs will be ongoing during the moorage period.<br />Foreseeable costs are required when the contractor's facility is fifty (50)<br />miles or more from the Marine Operations Center Pacific.<br />1.

BUY AMERICAN ACT/BALANCE OF PAYMENTS PROGRAM				EXHIBIT B

1.	BUY AMERICAN ACT  CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS  (FAR 52.225-9)(MAY 2002)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-- 
"Component" means any article, material, or supply incorporated directly into construction materials. 
"Construction material" means an article, material, or supply brought to the construction site by the Contractor or a subcontractor for incorporation into the building or work. The term also includes an item brought to the site preassembled from articles, materials, or supplies. However, emergency life safety systems, such as emergency lighting, fire alarm, and audio evacuation systems, that are discrete systems incorporated into a public building or work and that are produced as complete systems, are evaluated as a single and distinct construction material regardless of when or how the individual parts or components of those systems are delivered to the construction site. Materials purchased directly by the Government are supplies, not construction material. 
"Cost of components" means-- 
(1)	For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation 
costs to the place of incorporation into the construction material (whether or not such costs are paid to a domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or 
(2)	For components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the manufacture of 
the component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this definition, plus allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does not include any costs associated with the manufacture of the end product. 
"Domestic construction material" means-- 
(1) An unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in the United States; or 
(2) A construction material manufactured in the United States, if the cost of its components mined, 
produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components. Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind for which non-availability determinations have been made are treated as domestic. 
"Foreign construction material" means a construction material other than a domestic construction material. 
"United States" means the 50 States and the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and possessions, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and any other place subject to U.S. jurisdiction, but does not include leased bases. 
(b) Domestic preference. (1) This clause implements the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a - 10d) and the Balance of Payments Program by providing a preference for domestic construction material. The Contractor shall use only domestic construction material in performing this contract, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this clause. 
(2) This requirement does not apply to the construction material or components listed by the Government as follows: _________________________________________________________________________________
[Contracting Officer to list applicable excepted materials or indicate "none"] 
(3) The Contracting Officer may add other foreign construction material to the list in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause if the Government determines that-- 
(i)	The cost of domestic construction material would be unreasonable. The cost of a particular 
domestic construction material subject to the requirements of the Buy American Act is unreasonable when the cost of such material exceeds the cost of foreign material by more than 6 percent; 
(ii)	The application of the restriction of the Buy American Act to a particular construction material would be impracticable or inconsistent with the public interest; or 
(iii)	The construction material is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in 
sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality. 




										Exhibit B
										Page 2

 (c) Request for determination of inapplicability of the Buy American Act. (1)(i) Any Contractor request to use foreign construction material in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause shall include adequate information for Government evaluation of the request, including-- 
	
(A) A description of the foreign and domestic construction materials; 
(B) Unit of measure; 
(C) Quantity; 
(D) Price; 
(E) Time of delivery or availability; 
(F) Location of the construction project; 
(G) Name and address of the proposed supplier; and 
(H) A detailed justification of the reason for use of foreign construction materials cited in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause. 
(i)	A request based on unreasonable cost shall include a reasonable survey of the market and a completed price comparison table in the format in paragraph (d) of this clause. 
(iii) The price of construction material shall include all delivery costs to the construction site and 
any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free certificate may be issued). 
(ii)	Any Contractor request for a determination submitted after contract award shall explain 
why the Contractor could not reasonably foresee the need for such determination and could not have requested the determination before contract award. If the Contractor does not submit a satisfactory explanation, the Contracting Officer need not make a determination. 
(2) If the Government determines after contract award that an exception to the Buy American Act applies and the Contracting Officer and the Contractor negotiate adequate consideration, the Contracting Officer will modify the contract to allow use of the foreign construction material. However, when the basis for the exception is the unreasonable price of a domestic construction material, adequate consideration is not less than the differential established in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(3) Unless the Government determines that an exception to the Buy American Act applies, use of foreign construction material is noncompliant with the Buy American Act or Balance of Payments Program. 
(d) Data. To permit evaluation of requests under paragraph (c) of this clause based on unreasonable cost, the Contractor shall include the information and any applicable supporting data based on the survey of suppliers.

2.	NOTICE OF BUY AMERICAN ACT  CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS (FAR 52.225-10) (MAY 2002)

(a) Definitions. "Construction material," "domestic construction material," and "foreign construction material," as used in this provision, are defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled "Buy American Act-Construction Materials" (Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.225-9). 
(b) Requests for determinations of inapplicability. An offeror requesting a determination regarding the inapplicability of the Buy American Act should submit the request to the Contracting Officer in time to allow a determination before submission of offers. The offeror shall include the information and applicable supporting data required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9 in the request. If an offeror has not requested a determination regarding the inapplicability of the Buy American Act before submitting its offer, or has not received a response to a previous request, the offeror shall include the information and supporting data in the offer. 
(c) Evaluation of offers. (1) The Government will evaluate an offer requesting exception to the requirements of the Buy American Act, based on claimed unreasonable cost of domestic 
construction material, by adding to the offered price the appropriate percentage of the cost of such foreign construction material, as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9. 



										EXHIBIT B
										Page 3

(2) If evaluation results in a tie between an offeror that requested the substitution of foreign construction material based on unreasonable cost and an offeror that did not request an exception, the Contracting Officer will award to the offeror that did not request an exception based on unreasonable cost. 
(d) Alternate offers. (1) When an offer includes foreign construction material not listed by the Government in this solicitation in paragraph (b)(2) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9, the offeror also may submit an alternate offer based on use of equivalent domestic construction material. 
(2) If an alternate offer is submitted, the offeror shall submit a separate Standard Form 1442 for the alternate offer, and a separate price comparison table prepared in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9 for the offer that is based on the use of any foreign construction material for which the Government has not yet determined an exception applies. 
(3) If the Government determines that a particular exception requested in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9 does not apply, the Government will evaluate only those offers based on use of the equivalent domestic construction material, and the offeror shall be required to furnish such domestic construction material. An offer based on use of the foreign construction material for which an exception was requested-- 
(i) Will be rejected as non-responsive if this acquisition is conducted by sealed bidding; or 
(ii) May be accepted if revised during negotiations.

<a href="mailto:justin.pickett@amedd.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Conexus, Inc, 6912 Hightech Dr. STE B, Midvale, UT 84047-3719 for a 12 month base period and one 12 month option period for customized development of the Patient Movement Item Tracking System (PMITS) and its core commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software system, Plexus.  The Plexus software system is the backbone of the PMITS and enables medical personnel to control the location and distribution of moveable medical assets.  In order to properly integrate Plexus with DMLSS standard suite of products and serve the specific needs of PMITS, it was necessary to modify and customize the Plexus software system interface.  This customized version of the software is known as PlexusD.  Under the anticipated order, the contractor shall upgrade PlexusD and integrate this upgrade with the current PMITS 1.0.3.  The contractor shall also modify the DMLSS PMITS Web application to be compatible with the PMITS upgrades and enable radio frequency identification interoperability with PlexusD.   The objective of this effort is to provide the most efficient and effective system to track Patient Movement Item equipment within the Military Health System (MHS).  Any firm that believes it can provide the stated capability is invited to submit written notification to the Contracting Oficer within three (3) calendar days from the date of publication of this notice. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firms ability to provide the stated capability.  Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer at:  USAMRAA, ATT:  MCMR-AAA-P (Justin Pickett), 820 Chandler Street, Frederick, MD 21702-5014.  No telephone or facsimile requests will be accepted.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government Not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, USDAMRAA will proceed with the sole source contract.  Note 22 applies.<BR><BR>Sole Source Justification:<BR>1.)  Authority Cited:  This request is submitted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A)Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recover through competition.<BR>2.)   Reason for Authority Cited:  Only one source is capable of responding to the unique or specialized nature of the work.  That source is Conexus.  PMITS is based on the Plexus software system.  As stated earlier, the Plexus software system is a COTS application and therefore a proprietary asset of Conexus.  The Government possesses restricted rights to the software and is precluded from providing source code to any other developers.  Conexus is the only company capable of upgrading the PlexusD software system and integrating the system with PMITS since they possess proprietary data rights to the software code.PMITS is currently used at ninety-nine (99) sites to support Air Evacuation facilities and processes worldwide.  Award to any other source would hinder the abilities of military logistics personnel and health care providers to track patient movement item (PMI) assets worldwide, resulting in potential loss of assets.  The Government would incur re-procurement costs including the cost of the software system, customization, deployment, and training if an alternate system was procured.  These costs are estimated to exceed $2.4M, which would duplicate the PMITS investment incurred over the past two years.  Additionally, the time required to customize, deploy, and train would delay the PMITS program by a year or more and erase the substantial progress already achieved through implementation of the PlexusD software system. The combination of proprietary data rights, significant duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through competition and program delays of a year or more make Conexus the only source capable of responding to the current development requirements.  <BR>3.)  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Due to the highly specialized, software-specific and proprietary nature of this action, no other sources possess the knowledge and resources to meet the DMLSS requirements.  However, to ensure that future requirements are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable, DMLSS will re-evaluate its software usage as well as its rights to technical data in order to create a competitive data package that can be distributed as part of a Request for Information (RFI) to be issued through the Defense Systems Integration, Design, Development, Operations and Maintenance Support (D/SIDDOMS 3) Multiple Award Contract.<BR>4.)  Actions to Increase Competition:  One key barrier to competition is the proprietary rights of the software system.  Actions to remove this barrier may be cost prohibitive at this time, however, over the course of the proposed development effort, DMLSS will reevaluate its rights to the technical data.  Through on-going market surveillance and additional research the Government will attempt to identify competitive substitutable products and will compete the requirements when competition is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.<BR><BR>

<p>(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) Are, (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) Have, (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) Are, (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006] [Full Text Follows] (a) Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. "Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002. (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. (End of provision) NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103.  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:<BR><BR>Technical capability, past performance, and price.<BR><BR>(b) Provide the following information with your quote:<BR><BR>1.  Technical Capability:   If providing an equal product(s), quotes must comply with FAR provision 52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal.<BR><BR> 2.  Past Performance.  Attached to this solicitation is a Past Performance Questionnaire to be completed by three customers of the same or similar products or services.

Quotes received at other than the stated address will not be considered for award.<BR><BR>Evaluation Process:  All quotes will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:  1. Each vendor will be evaluated on its overall Past Performance under the existing or prior contracts for the same or similar supplies and/or equipment as well as Technical Capability.  Pricing will be evaluated to determine value offered for the price and the extent to which it is fair and reasonable in terms of the Governments requirement.  The Government reserves the right to evaluate quoted prices on the basis of price realism and will consider quoted prices as an indication of understanding the scope and complexity of the governments requirement. 2.  The award decision will be based on the Best Value offered to the Government and not solely on price related factors.  In making the award decision, the Contracting Officer will consider the evaluated rating of all factors.  3.  Technical Capability and Past Performance are equal in importance.  Technical capability and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  Price could become the determinative selection factor if the quality of the quotes are determined to be essentially equal, or if a quote deemed superior in technical quality is determined not to worth the high price premium.  The Trade-off between technical merit and price could result in awarding to other than the low offeror.  Vendors shall include a completed copy of FAR provision 52.212-3 with their offer.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006] [Full Text Follows] (a) Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. "Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002. (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. (End of provision) NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011. Anticipated award date is no later than 04 September 2008. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 02 September 2008. PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION. Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the Attention of: Dennis Gaines at 252-335-6790. Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the nomenclature; part number; unit price and extended price, FOB point; payment terms and any discount offered for prompt payment, the business size standard and any minority classification; delivery date, and Representation and Certifications contained in FAR Clause 52.212-3, including Alternate I.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Rationale for Brand Name Procurement


1.  Contracting Agency  Acquisition and Procurement Office (A&PO).

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to:</p>
<p>1: Combine requirement FD2020-08-77112 with requirement FD2020-07-77029 adding an additional dollar amount of $804,882.87 to the total.</p>
<p>2: Increase total dollar amount from $611,819.18 to $4,591,771.11.&nbsp; Additional funds in the amount of $3,736,581.84 were given&nbsp;to the ACRN that initially had&nbsp;$611,819.18 and an FMS requirement has also been added to this requirement for a total of $50,306.40 (3,736,581.84+804,882.87+50,306.40 = $4,591,771.11)</p>
<p>3: Therefore, in an effort to combine these two revised requirements, the&nbsp;additional CLINs 0001AD, 0001AE, 0001AF, 0001AG have been added to accurately reflect the purchase requests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4: All CLINs will be buy-to-dollar with the exception of CLIN 0001AD (Bid A) and CLIN 0001AG (Bid B) as these CLINs reflect&nbsp;the purchase of FMS materials and will therefore will buy-to-quantity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><p>This is a Sources Sought Notice only. This neither constitutes a Request for Proposal nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This Sources Sought Notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. This is not a request for a proposal but a survey to locate potential sources to operate and maintain the Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) performed primarily at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB). This requirement is for on-site calibration, repair and maintenance support of various test, measurement, and diagnostic equipment (TMDE) in Colorado and Wyoming. The 21st Contracting Squadron at PAFB Colorado seeks potential sources to provide PMEL operations during normal duty hours and 24-hours-a-day during natural disasters or crises. The contractor shall be responsible to provide all labor support required to perform metrology services and repair as needed of TMDE at Government-owned laboratories with Government-furnished calibration equipment and standards. Operations of the laboratory include gaining and maintaining certification by the Air Force Metrology and Calibration (AFMETCAL) Program. The draft Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued in the future and will include a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS). The Government anticipates italicizing a best value source selection to award a firm, fixed price (FFP) contract for a basic year of performance (1 Mar 09 through 28 Feb 10) with four one-year options. The subsequent contract is also anticipated to include up to a month phase-in period (Feb 09). The current contract type is Firm Fixed Price with a cost-reimbursable logistics CLIN. Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates to any and all documents. All potential offerors are reminded, that in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) clause 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR), that lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for contract award. This synopsis also contains the following Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) clause: 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman. (a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. (b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). (c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen: A7K, 150 Vandenberg St, Ste 1105, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4350, 719-554-5250, fax 719-554-5299, a7k.wf@afspc.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. (d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. (e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

The ESOC has in the past encountered issues when mix HW from different vendors like Dell and HP.  Due to these issues, we had to enlist outside vendor support to remediate the problems.  The HP hardware requested in this PR is similar to the existing (20) ESX servers that are currently housed in the ESOC and are consistent with our standard.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid. <BR><BR>

<DESC><p>The U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), intends to procure services for the purchase and installation of Network Equipment for a Redundant Failover Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) Web Site for the NOAA Fisheries Service, Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) in Miami, Florida. This procurement will be acquired in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations, Subpart 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. There is an existing website at the Southeast Regional Office (SERO) in St. Petersburg, Florida. The equipment purchased and installed as part of this procurement action will be installed at both the SEFSC and SERO. The resultant action will be a firm-fixed price contract/purchase order. The work involves the purchase, installation, and configuration of the network infrastructure hardware only. It does not involve the purchase, installation, or configuration of the web server hardware or software. Some coordination with the systems administrators responsible for installing the web server hardware will be required to ensure proper operation of the overall system. There are existing network infrastructures at both SERO and SEFSC. Therefore, specific hardware, software, and services are needed to implement the new system. These include items such as the, brand name or equal, having the following salient characteristics: CISCO Global Site Selector, GSS Version 2.0, Power Card 110V, SMARTNET 8X5XNBD Global Site Selector, GSS DDOS Software License, CISCO Application Control Engine (ACE) 4710 Hardware for Bundles, ACE 4710 BAS Bundle License, ACE Appliance SW 1.7A, Power Cord 110V, SMARTNET 8X5XNBD, ACE 4710 HW-1 Gbps-1K SSL 100MbpsComp 5VC. The SERO currently has a web site that supports an Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) system for the Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper Fishery. This is a real-time system used by commercial fishers and dealers to record the landings and the sales of Red Snapper in the States, within the United States, surrounding the Gulf of Mexico. The landing and sale of the Red Snapper cannot occur without entering the information into this system and getting the necessary approval codes. This system is critical to the Red Snapper Fishery; therefore, the SERO wants to create a redundant failover "hot site" at a different location (the SEFSC) in case the SERO site is inaccessible for any reason (e.g., extended power outage, hurricane, fire). There are currently two servers at the SERO. Part of the work is to install and configure the new network equipment to provide automatic failover from the primary server to the secondary server in the event of the primary server goes down. The SEFSC has an existing public -facing network infrastructure that will be used to support the network equipment and servers for the new IFQ hot site. The new network equipment that will be installed as part of this procurement action must be configured to first failover to the secondary server at the SERO in the event the primary server goes down or is not accessible. In the event neither the primary nor the secondary server at the SERO is functioning or accessible, the new equipment must be configured to automatically failover to the system located at the SEFSC. The systems should be configured to automatically restore service to the primary or secondary server at SERO when they become accessible and functional. Also, the equipment must be configured in any way necessary to support the database and application synchronization required between the IFQ servers at the two locations. The period of performance is sixty (60) calendar days. The Service Contract Act labor rates for the Miami-Dade County, Florida and Pinellas County, Florida areas are applicable to this procurement and can be accessed at http://www.wdol.gov/wagedeterminations. This is a total small business set-aside. NAICS code 423430 applies. The resultant procurement action will be firm-fixed price. The Central Region Acquisitions Division requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisitions Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR and ORCA, please access the following websites: http://www.ccr.gov/and http://orca.bpn.gov, respectively. In order to register in CCR and ORCA and to be eligible to receive an award for this acquisition office, all bidders must have a Dun and Bradstreet number. A Dun and Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun and Bradstreet on-line at http://www.dnb.com/product/uepdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505.&nbsp; Technical is considered more important than price.&nbsp; As technical proposals become more equal, price shall become more important and conversely as price becomes more equal, technical becomes more important.&nbsp; RFQ Number WC133R-08-RQ-0584MLW is applicable to this procurement action and will be available on or about August 28, 2008. The Request for Quotation can be accessed through Federal Business Opportunities website. Inquiries may be mailed to Mamie L. Wandick@noaa.gov or faxed to (816) 274-6962 or mailed to U. S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, Mamie L. Wandick, 601 East 12th Street, Room 1756, Kansas City, MO 64106. Technical questions should be made to Mr. David Buker at (727) 551-5617.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to the solicitation is to post a solicitation question and response.

The following question was submitted:

QUESTION: 

The bid request is for a Samson Plus 4200 - 62" Laminator but the Salient Characteristics call for the unit to laminate material between 40-44".

Do you want a 44" Laminator or a 62" Laminator?

RESPONSE: 

This is a typo.  The Sampson is a 42" laminator.  We are looking for a laminator that can laminate between 40-44".  We purposely selected a range.

All other terms and conditions remain the same and unchanged.

Please acknowledge receipt of this amendement with your quote.

<DESC><p>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) at Scott Air Force Base, IL intends to issue a sole source modification to CSC Systems &amp; Solutions LLC, 15000 Conference Center Drive, Chantilly, VA 20151-3819. The proposed modification is a continuation and extension of the work performed by CSC under contract HC1013-04-C-5000 that was awarded in February 2004 as an other than full and open competitive action. This modification will extend the period of performance of the contract for the existing Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS) and Wireless Priority Service (WPS) Integration Contract (IC) by one year plus an option for one additional year for the period of 01 January 2009 through 31 December 2010. This service is a major Department of Homeland Security program for improving national security and emergency preparedness telecommunications in the event of natural or man-made disasters by utilizing the surviving assets of the public switched network to provide priorities and routing alternatives not available to normal telecommunications traffic. This modification will allow for the completion of taskings that were expected to be completed under the contract&rsquo;s original period of performance. Efforts requiring this extension include implementation of WPS Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) Interoperability Specifications (IOS) and completion of National Security and Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) Next Generation Networks (NGN) Priority Service efforts. It is essential that NS/EP priority requirements be incorporated in the NGN core and access to eventually transition existing priority telecommunications voice services (GETS, Special Routing Arrangement Service (SRAS, and WPS) to NGN. GETS, SRAS, and WPS capabilities are based on circuit-based network technologies that will disappear as networks transition to Internet protocol (IP) packet-based platforms. To maintain operational readiness and continuous capability to perform its primary mission, DHS and its major customer i.e., DoD cannot afford any disruption of GETS/WPS services. The above contract action will be awarded sole source to CSC, based on their unique ability and capability to maintain the current GETS/WPS services and to begin the transition of these existing services to NGN. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. All inquiries regarding the sole source modification shall be submitted electronically and directed to Joyce B. King, Contracting Officer, Phone 618-229-9646, email joyce.king@disa.mil, or Cheryl Wilsing, Contract Specialist, Phone 618-229-9145, email cheryl.wilsing@disa.mil.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to clarify the due date for Expressions of Interest (EOI's).  EOI's are due on Wednesday, September 10, 2008.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The United States Government is seeking sources for Office and Related Space
in the Central Employment Area, Washington, DC.

REQUIREMENT:     The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in Washington, DC, under a lease that expires on November 30, 2008.  The Government is seeking to lease 104,934 BOMA Rentable Square Feet (BRSF) of office and related space, including 6 parking spaces.  The 104,934 BRSF of space must yield at least 96,557 BOMA Area Square Feet (BOASF).  The space must be provided in one building.  The delineated area for this requirement is the Central Employment Area in Washington, DC.  

The requirement is for a 10-year term fully serviced lease with termination options after the 7th year.  The space must be ready for occupancy by December 1, 2008.  

The Government intends to enter into a sole source procurement to remain in its existing leased space but will accept expressions of interest to determine whether there are other potentially acceptable locations that demonstrate the best interests of the Government are served by moving to an alternate location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, relocation costs, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, and the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements.  The Government is presently seeking authority to enter into a sole source succeeding lease at the existing location and therefore reserves the right to cancel any ongoing procurement that might result from the identification of other potentially acceptable locations.

The Governments decision regarding whether or not to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this notification.  In the event that a potentially acceptable offer fails to provide required information as part of its response to this notification, the Government reserves the right to assume that the building in question cannot meet the Governments requirements.

Expressions of interest must be in writing and should be forwarded by 3:00 pm on Wednesday, September 10, 2008 to:
