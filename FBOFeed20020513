<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory has a requirement for architectural and engineering services and anticipates awarding two Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts as a result of this synopsis.   It is anticipated that the maximum quantity required for each contract will be $500,000.  The minimum value the Government will be required to order will be $25,000 and no single order will have a fee in excess of $300,000.  The contractor will be required to provide multi-disciplined design work with an emphasis on the mechanical and electrical disciplines.  Design skills must be demonstrated for the following building types: office buildings, industrial warehouses, and general laboratory space.  Typical work may include the following types of efforts: (a) architectural and structural support services such as, significant renovations and/or demolition of existing spaces or buildings; (b) modification of electrical systems and upgrading existing building power distribution systems;  (c) renovation and replacement of HVAC systems, re-design of water systems (internal to the building), installation and extension of sprinkler systems, installation of restrooms, and installation and retrofitting of elevators in existing buildings;  (d) studies relating to code research, space planning, cost analysis, structural analysis and architectural evaluation; (e) demolition of buildings including removal of hazardous materials and assessment of environmental concerns.  Asbestos and lead are known to be present in many of the buildings here on the Laboratory.  Therefore, the A&E firm will be required to identify and provide a design, which will accommodate the disposal of these materials in the construction plans and specifications in accordance with applicable rules and regulations.  The first delivery order to be placed under one of the two prospective contracts will be for a design to renovate six (6) restrooms in Building A-59.  The restrooms must be handicap accessible.  More specifically, the contractor will be required to complete a design and specification that will provide (1) new fixtures and partitions, (2) ceramic tile on the floor and on the wet walls (to a height of six (6) feet); and (3) new paint and acoustical ceilings (unless existing ceiling is drywall).  It should be noted that plumbing changes (piping) are expected to be minimized.  And, as previously stated hazardous materials may be present, thus the effort should be treated as such.  The first delivery order to be placed under the second contract will set forth the requirement for the contractor to design the construction of offices on the deck in Building A-59.  The deck must be outfitted with offices, a conference room, restrooms, and electronic laboratories.  The contractor will further be required to provide a new means of Code compliant egress connecting to the existing exits on the first floor.  The second floor space should be laid out to maximize the functionality of the space.  Air conditioning and heating will be supplied by chilled water and hot water, however, the contractor will have to expand the current hot water system.  The resulting system must be large enough to handle the north side of Building A-59.  Chilled water will be supplied by the current system, however a supplemental chiller may be required.  The government will provide access to all mechanical equipment.  The contractor will have to design the system to include sprinklers.  The contractor's design and specifications must provide for system furniture and modular walls where possible.  The contractor shall design the ceilings to be nine (9) feet high.  The contractor must ensure that provisions are made for communication and data transfer.  And, as previously stated hazardous materials are known to be present, thus the effort should be treated as such.  The NRL will determine which effort will be assigned to either awardee, based on experience and qualifications.  Firms responding to this announcement must do so in accordance with the requirements set forth in Note 24 and the evaluation criteria listed at FAR 36.602-1 and DFARS 236.602-1, which are being presented below in descending order of importance:   (1) The contractor shall provide specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, with significant emphasis on Mechanical and Electrical disciplines, as well as Architectural and Civil disciplines, and Elevators.  This proof of specialized experience and technical competence must include experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials where appropriate.  The A&E firm must indicate past experience by citing examples of the work required.  Responding A/E firms must address both of the potential projects.  (2) The contractor shall provide professional qualifications of personnel and proposed subcontractors for the project.  Examples must be provided for similar projects performed by the proposed team and the duties performed by each of the team members.  If the proposed team has not worked together before, companies must provide experience of the individuals with their proven ability to work in a diverse team environment.  (3) Each contractor must also provide convincing evidence of the firm's, as well as, the entire team's capacity to accomplish the work within the required time limits (usually nine weeks for the average projects plus Government review time).  It is very important to demonstrate the ability to juggle workload and manage a number of projects at one time, as would be required in an IDIQ type contract environment.  (4) The contractor must provide past performance information on contracts with Government agencies and private industry, which demonstrates cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.  Demonstrating this should include, at a minimum, things such as letters of commendation/appreciation, a list of contracts, preferably IDIQ type contracts with multiple orders, the points of contact and phone numbers for references.  (5) Contractors will also be evaluated on their location, which typically should be in the general geographic area of the project, provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.  Contractors must be sure to include the location of each of the proposed subcontractors.  (6) Contractors must provide the volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense (within the last twelve months).  Those firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement, and wish to be considered, must respond no later than 4:00 PM EST on the response date specified herein.  It is anticipated that the two IDIQ type contracts to be awarded as a result of this synopsis will have a period of performance of 24-months from the date each contract is awarded.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541310.  All questions should be directed to the point of contact below.   All interested parties must send copies of SF-254's and SF-255's using the mailing address set forth herein to Contracting Officer, ATTN: Code 3230 LS.

<DESC>The Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA)/Division of Transplants (DOT)/Office of Special Programs (OSP), synopsis/intend to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a contract with Sandrine's Gift of Life, Ottawa, ON Canada.  This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Contract by Negotiation Procedures as outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Parts 15 and 6.302-1.  The purpose of this acquisition is the creation of an online classroom community to promote organ and tissue donation education program that can be accessed in classrooms throughout the country.  The project shall be geared to students in grades five through twelve.  Education modules highlighting the function of each transplantable organ; ways to maximize the health of each transplantation possible' and the positive aspects of organ and tissue donation should be drafted, disseminated to transplantation professionals for edition, and reviewed by teachers and students to determine that content and education-level are appropriate.  Each formal component of the project shall be designed and implemented at two different educational levels - one for middle school students and teachers and an additional component for secondary school students and teachers.  Plans for fostering online donation and transplantation discussions among geographically diverse groups of students and for linking students and teachers to transplant experts for live chats also should be developed and implemented.  Because the program is based on an unsolicited proposal, which the Government has determined this to be an unique and imitative approach which was independently originated and developed by the offeror, prepared without the Government's supervision, benefits the Agency's mission, and was not an advance proposal for a known agency requirement, Sandrine's Gift of Life is deemed the only responsible source capable of providing the required work and service under authority in 41 U.S.C. 253 (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 (A) (2) (I).  The Contractor has spent a substantial amount of effort in developing a technical assistance network and will do this work with a large portion of the effort as an in-kind contribution.  Any other source would have to duplicate a substantial variety of current and previous efforts to accomplish the same objectives.  A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file.

<DESC>The Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA)/Center for Health Services Financing and Managed Care (CMC), synopsis/intend to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a contract with Michigan State University/College of Human Medicine, East Lansing, Michigan.  This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Contract by Negotiation Procedures as outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Parts 15 and 6.302-1.  The purpose of this contract is to continue the effort begun in FY 2001 regarding the collection and measurement of sentinel health outcomes by race and ethnicity, this phase of the activity will move the project from collection and determination of the validity and reliability of information collected by race and ethnicity, into application of that information in Medicaid managed care programs across the Nation.  At the end of this contract, a small group of State Medicaid programs will have voluntarily participated in the implementation of this performance measurement process. Information regarding feasible approaches to organizing the collection of performance measurement information by race and ethnicity within the context of Medicaid managed care will be summarized, and the value of that information in motivating change within Medicaid managed care plans will be described.  Because the program is a continuation of work started in FY01, the Contractor has spent a substantial amount of effort in developing a technical assistance network and will do this work with a large portion of the effort as an in-kind contribution.  Any other source would have to duplicate a substantial variety of current and previous efforts to accomplish the same objectives.  A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file.

Services include, but are not limited to the preparation of planning documents of various types normally used by the U.S. Navy, and technical services related to documents and software as may be requested by the Department of the Navy, PACNAVFACENGCOM.  The primary tasks anticipated for the Architect-Engineer (A-E), are the originating and the updating of planning studies and documents.  Additionally, the A-E may be assigned ancillary work to edit and rework incomplete or preliminary planning documents towards final completed products based on technical knowledge and skills gained by professional training and experience in the planning and maintenance of military and Government facilities and installations.  Planning documents, as referred to herein, include but are not limited to any document relating to Master Plans, Capital Improvement Plans, Regional Shore Infrastructure Planning (RSIP)/Studies, Special Planning Studies, Air Installations Compatible Use Zones (AICUZ) Studies, Military Construction Project write-ups (normally on Department of Defense Standard Form 1391), Special Projects write-ups, Engineering Evaluations (EEs), Facilities Requirements Plans (FRP), Basic Facility Requirement (BFR) justifications, Economic Analyses (EA), Environmental Studies, Civil Engineering Support Plan, Land Inventory Analyses, studies, visual presentations, graphics, and/or any component or portion (not necessarily the entirety) of such documents.  The work will also include the production of planning documents and studies over the Navy's intranet, including the programming of associated software necessary to or incidental thereto.  Field verification survey work may also be an ancillary part of the planning process.  Any preparatory work, visual presentation, briefing, study, or report, which may be required prior to the initiation of any planning document listed, is also included under this scope.  Planning projects may include those for other U.S. Military Commands (including the U.S. Coast Guard) in the Pacific and Indian Ocean area, in addition to those of the U.S. Navy.  The A-E shall provide all professional services required for the completion of planning documents, including researching data, conducting site surveys, preparing, reviewing, and editing technical text and graphics to ensure completeness and correctness of documents.  When such services are required of the A-E for projects not wholly assigned to the A-E alone, the A-E must exercise professional judgment to verify the correctness and validity of the information, and the results and conclusions of the material the A-E is called upon to finalize.  The A-E must analyze, coordinate, correlate, synthesize, correct, supplement, and finalize the work assigned.  As an example of such an assignment, if the A-E is called upon to finalize the draft of a document or a particular graphic submitted by PACNAVFACENGCOM, the A-E shall rework such document or graphic until, in the A-E's judgment, the finished product is correct, complete, and reflective of the A-E's professional judgment and standards.  The A-E shall provide electronic deliverables for the publication of planning documents and the integration of source data used or generated during the planning process into the Regional Shore Infrastructure Plan (RSIP-Link) information system.

SELECTION CRITERIA:  On your SF 255, please indicate in the same box as your firm?s name and address if your firm is an 8(a), HUB-zone, small business or large business concern.  The selection will be based on the following criteria with Criteria (1), (2) and (3) being the most important and equally weighted.  Criteria (4) through (7) are in descending order of importance.  Criteria are as follows (Note: all projects listed shall be those completed by the office/branch that will be accomplishing the work under this contract. When listing projects, indicate a point of contact, name of agency or client, accessible phone number, and a contract number, if applicable) :

In Block 4 of the SF-255, show the entire proposed team by listing personnel employed by the prime contractor in the blanks provided and personnel from sub-consultants to the left in parentheses.  In Block 7 indicate the branch office location of each team member.  The prime contractor must have one or more licensed professional engineers to perform the work anticipated under this contract.  Professional Qualifications of subcontractor firm personnel will be given less weight in the evaluation than prime contractor personnel under the current team structure.

CRITERIA 2, SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE and technical competence of the proposed team in the type of work described above.

The prime contractor firm must demonstrate experience in developing and completing CERCLA RI/FSs and RODs for Federal agencies.  Experience with Nevada or Washington State regulations relating to the required services discussed above is desired; however, experience with both is preferred.  

CRITERIA 3, PAST PERFORMANCE by the firm on projects requiring similar services to those shown above, in terms of quality of work, cost control, and compliance with performance schedules.  Indicate any recent awards, recommendations, other performance evaluations, or ratings. In addition, briefly describe internal quality control and quality assurance procedures, and indicate team members who are responsible for monitoring these processes.  In evaluating, the Government may consider information obtained from past and present customers, other Government agencies, current and former sub-consultants, ratings in ACASS/CCASS, and any other sources deemed necessary by the Government.  

CRITERIA 4, CAPACITY to accomplish the work in the required time and ability to handle multiple projects at the same time.  Indicate the firm?s present and projected workload and the availability of all the proposed team members for the specified contract period.  

CRITIERA 5, LOCATION in the general geographical area of EFA NW and knowledge of the Navy bases under EFA NW area of responsibility; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.  

CRITERIA 6, COMMITMENT TO SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS:  Use of small/small disadvantaged or women-owned business firms as primary consultants or as subconsultants.  (If a large business should be selected for this contract, they will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan prior to award.  NAVFAC?s targets are 62.9% for small business, 2.5% for HUBZone business, 14.5% for small disadvantaged business, 13.6% woman-owned small business, and 3% for veteran owned small business or disabled veteran-owned small business of the business to be subcontracted out). 

CRITERIA 7, EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF WORK.  List the total amount of DOD contract awards as the prime contractor within the past 12 months in Block 9 of the SF 255. 

Those firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement and who wish to be considered, must submit one copy each of a SF-254 and SF-255 for the firm and a SF-254 for each consultant listed in Block 6 of the firm?s SF-255.

APPLICABLE WR-ALC LOCAL NOTES:  "B" Ombudsman, "F" Export Controlled.
"B" - All potential offerors should contact the buyer/PCO identified below for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition. If your concerns are not satisfied by the contacting officer an Ombudsman has been appointed  to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Ms Kim McDonald, Chief, Contract Policy Division, at 912-926-2604. Please be prepared to identify previous contacts made by you in an attempt to resolve your concerns.  "F" - This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application.  The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose. US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation. To request this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017- 3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or call DLSC at the above number. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice.  Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Marine Fisheries Service, Alaska Fisheries Science Center seeks proposals from qualified applicants to develop models that will quantitatively evaluate the costs and benefits of alternative management strategies on the recovery rate of the western stock of Steller sea lions.  Management strategies should be specific to each of the possible factors that could have caused or may have contributed to the decline of the western sea lion population, including:

1) indirect effects of fisheries (competition or disturbance), 
2) decadal or cyclical changes in the oceanic environment, 
3) anthropogenic effects (direct mortality), 
4) increased rates or effects of predation, 
5) disease, 
6) contaminants, and 
7) combinations of the above.

The model must consider the possible effects of each factor independently and in combination.  For instance, the model must be capable of distinguishing the relative impact of past and present fishing and changes in the environment on the past and current western Steller sea lion population.  This could be accomplished by determining the possible influence of each factor on rates of sea lion mortality, reproduction and migration, and the mechanisms for that influence.  Process and observational uncertainty should be explicitly included in the model; use of Bayesian methods is encouraged.  

A Request for Proposals (RFP) providing detailed technical and performance specifications and proposal instructions will be issued on or about May 29, 2002.  The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541690.  To request a copy of the RFP please fax request to Crystina Elkins at (206) 526-6025 at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Western Administrative Support Center (WASC), Acquisition Management Division WC 32, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115.

<DESC>The Government intends to acquire via full and open competition procedures, integrated logistic support services, including inventory and logistics distribution for the contract period necessary to:
      a. operate a full service walk-in retail store at Naval Station Norfolk (Super Servmart); 
      b. operate a full service walk-in retail store at Naval Air Station Oceana (Oceana Touch-N-Go Servmart);
      c. operate a mobile retail store(s), which shall service Hampton Roads Area VA and Elizabeth City NC Area U.S. Government activities;
      d. provide a free delivery service (with no minimum order required) to Hampton Roads Area and Elizabeth City NC Area U.S. Government activities; 
      e. participate in the DoD E-Mall by providing an electronic file of the Contractor's catalog; and
      f. provide floppy diskettes of each walk-in store catalog to customers upon request and each time the catalog is updated.  

The purpose of the resultant contract is to provide all U.S. Naval activities (defined as all U.S. Naval ashore and afloat units in the Hampton Roads Area and Elizabeth City NC Area) with a full range of quality items, at discount prices, with either customer pickup or delivery in accordance with the delivery schedules contained in the contract.  The supplies/equipment offered shall be of the type that is typically carried and offered in standard office, hardware, electrical, and restaurant supply warehouses and retail stores.  The Contractor is encouraged to add items to the list based upon its corporate capability.  However, all new items shall be reviewed by the COR/ACOR to ensure compliance with the performance statement of work prior to being added to the store or catalog. 

By entering into a contract, the U.S. Navy does not acquire, nor is it required to acquire, any item from the Contractor.  The purchase of supplies/equipment will only be made by the way of individual U.S. Government activity purchase orders, U.S. Government Credit Card purchases, or via FISC Norfolk or NAS Oceana delivery orders.  Sales are neither guaranteed nor promised under the contract.  Currently, at the Norfolk Super Servmart, the Virginia Industries for the Blind (VIB) are a subcontractor.  Offerors are encouraged to subcontract/partner with VIB.

The proposed acquisition is a follow-on effort to two current contracts: N00189-00-A-7018 (Norfolk Super Servmart administered by FISC Norfolk) and N00140-97C-0682 (Oceana Touch-N-Go Servmart administered by FISC Norfolk, Philadelphia Detachment), both of which are no cost contracts. An IDIQ type no cost contract will be utilized for a base year with the option to procure services for four additional one-year option periods.  The periods of performance for the Norfolk Super Servmart (approximate start date is mid-December 2002) are different from the Oceana Touch-N-Go Servmart (1 October 2002).  The minimum guarantee of $50,000.00 will be met by U.S. Government customers of both Servmarts placing orders via any of the methods mentioned above.  Currently, the annual sales have averaged $25M for the Norfolk Super Servmart and $3M for the Naval Air Station Oceana Touch-N-Go Servmart.  

The U.S. Government will provide the buildings and some maintenance services.  The Contractor will provide the necessary management, personnel furnishings, fixtures, equipment and supplies to operate the retail stores.  Supplies and equipment required to perform under this contract may include shelving, display cases, cash registers, point of sale system, material handling equipment (MHE), and battery charging stations if MHE is battery driven.  The Contractor shall be required to offer and distribute JWOD/UNICOR products and shall not offer for sale, commercial items that are identical or essentially the same as the JWOD/UNICOR items.  

The solicitation will contain clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services.  Solicitation issuance is anticipated as 03 June 2002 with a pre-proposal conference (date and exact location to be specified in the solicitation) to be held in Norfolk and Virginia Beach, Virginia. Offerors will be restricted to two representatives for the pre-proposal conference.    

Award will be based upon a best value evaluation of price, technical proposal and past performance.  In those instances of a large business proposal, the Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be evaluated for compliance with the solicitation provisions.

<DESC>NA THIS IS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE! I.  PROJECT DATA SUBJECT: Water Treatment Plant Evaluations, Performance-Based Training (PBT), Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (LDHH), Office of Public Health (OPH) Region 1 AUTHORIZATION: Section 22 of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1974 and Section 208 of the WRDA of 1992 Department of Health and Hospitals II.  GENERAL Statement of Work.  The work to be accomplished consists of providing one trainer for the Performance-Based Training (PBT) of six (6) to ten (10) surface water treatment plants in Region 1 OPH.  This is the second PBT in the state of Louisiana.  The work w ill be completed under the Planning Assistance to States (PAS) program as outlined in ER 105-2-100, Planning Guidance Notebook, whereby the Corps of Engineers will provide technical assistance to the LDHH.  A description of the work that will be performed by the Contractor is discussed in Section V, Task Description. The Composite Correction Program (CCP) was developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Process Applications, Inc. to improve surface water treatment plant performance, achieve compliance with the Surface Water Treatment Rule, and provide max imum protection to public health.  The CCP is divided into two phases, a Comprehensive Performance Evaluation (CPE) and Comprehensive Technical Assistance (CTA).  A CTA is used to improve performance of an existing plant by systematically addressing the fa ctors limiting performance identified during the first phase, the CPE.  Because a CTA involves one-on-one facilitation, performance is improved at only one plant during the 12-18 month effort.  In order to develop a more cost effective and timely means to accomplish the same objective as a CTA, Performance-Based Training (PBT) was developed and piloted by the USEPA Technical Support Center and Process Applications, Inc.  Performance-Based Training is a variation on the CTA, utilizing the same priority setti ng and problem solving skill transfer, but concurrently involving multiple facilities (e.g., six to ten). Efforts undertaken in this delivery order are being conducted as part of the EPA Region 6 Area Wide Optimization Program (AWOP) pilot.  The Corps and LDHH jointly manage the Louisiana AWOP efforts, and participate in the Region 6 pilot through the PAS prog ram.  The efforts outlined in this scope of work are part of the Louisiana “Follow-Up” component of the AWOP model.    III.  STUDY AREAS AND PROBLEMS The CCP aims to identify approaches for communities to improve water treatment plant performance by implementing changes in their operation, maintenance, and administration procedure in lieu of major capital improvements.  By maximizing the operational eff iciency of their facilities, local administrations can both improve the ability of the facility to meet Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) requirements and minimize the financial impact to the community associated with major upgrades to the plant. The Corps/LDHH partnership has recently completed a pilot PBT in northwestern Louisiana with 6 plants.  Letters announcing the second PBT in the state of Louisiana were mailed to twelve (12) plants in OPH Region 1 in February 2002.  Following an initial sc reening (done jointly by the Corps and LDHH), it was determined that all plants would be included in the second screening.  Administrative site visits will be conducted at these twelve (12) facilities by the Corps/LDHH team in May 2002, in order to aid in the selection of plants to participate in the second Louisiana PBT.  Administrative site visit will be held at each facility in order to provide the plant with an overview of the PBT effort.  From the twelve facilities visited, six (6) to ten (10) will ult imately be identified as participants in the PBT.  Seven of the twelve facilities currently under consideration have already had CPEs conducted under the Corps/LDHH partnership, and one facility has participated in a CTA.  For those facilities which have not had a CPE conducted, a Performance Potential Graph (PPG) will been created by the Corps/LDHH to determine if the plant is physically capable of meeting optimized performance goals.  The PBT ef fort will address “central tendency factors” commonly found during CPEs and will NOT focus on individual performance limiting factors identified at the facilities. IV.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK AND SERVICES The methodology for conducting PBT is a combination of utilizing general CPE results, or “central tendency factors”, as a basis for follow up.  The PBT consists of implementing process control priority-setting and problem solving techniques, and maintainin g long-term involvement to systematically train staff and administrators responsible for water treatment.  The ultimate goal of the PBT is to optimize individual plant performance to continuously meet a turbidity of less than 0.10 NTU from individual filte rs.  However, success of the training will also be measured by improved performance during and after the training effort (as compared to performance prior to the training).  Improved performance will be measured utilizing plant effluent turbidity levels (9 5th percentile, percentage of time performing less than 0.10 NTU, percentage of time performing less than 0.20 NTU, percentage of time performing less than 0.30 NTU, etc.).  The PBT training sessions will aim to create an environment where there is tenacit y for producing high quality finished water and to transfer process control skills to operation staff.   This second PBT in the state of Louisiana will be conducted with the Contractor providing one trainer for all sessions, while the Corps will serve as the second trainer.  The duration of PBT#2 is expected to span a period of 12-18 months (including prepara tion prior to the kickoff session).  A core team of facilitators will be assembled from representatives of the Corps, LDHH, and EPA Region 6.  These facilitators will be persons who have previously participated as team members on a minimum of three (3) CPE s.  The facilitators will be assigned individual plant(s), and will be the main point-of-contact for the plant personnel at their assigned plant(s).  The facilitators will conduct all required site visits, phone calls, and other contact with their assigned  facilities.  This facilitation includes preparing memorandums of record from site visits and phone calls.  The Contractor is not expected to generate memos and/or reports, but will be expected to review and provide guidance on memos and reports generated by the plant facilitators. The PBT will consist of five (5) training sessions, to be held at approximately quarterly intervals.  Dates will be mutually agreed upon by the Contractor, the Corps, LDHH, EPA Region 6, and the individual plants participating in the training.  The Contrac tor and the Corps will be jointly responsible for conducting these five (5) sessions, to include development and presentation of materials during the sessions.  Division of individual responsibilities will be decided between the Contractor and the Corps, w ith each taking approximately 50% of the required work effort.  Each session is expected to last one day (with the plant staff), and will include a debriefing session with the plant facilitators following the training session.  Throughout the PBT effort, the facilitators from the Corps, LDHH, and EPA Region 6 will independently conduct any needed site visits at their individual facilities, without the physical presence of the Contractor.  During these site visits and between the training sessions, the Contractor will provide data interpretation, office consultation, and technical support to the facilitators.  It is expected that a one to two-hour conference call will be held among the Contractor, Corps, and plant facilitators betw een each session (4 calls).   Individual plants and the Corps/LDHH personnel will complete all data compilation and analysis.  The Contractor is not expected to compile or analyze individual plant performance data, with the exception of minimal data manipulation required for session material.   The representative from the Contractor should be knowledgeable and experienced in the practical aspects of water treatment plant operations.  Such operations include chemical coagulant applications, clarifier operation and sludge treatment and disposal, sa nd filter operation, backwashing and maintenance methods, disinfection techniques, and laboratory testing functions.  The trainer provided by the Contractor shall also have extensive experience in optimization of water treatment plants using the CCP proces s.  Extensive Contractor experience in conducting CPEs, CTAs, and in particular PBTs, is a requirement.  The Contractor should be able to demonstrate that they have experience in conducting PBT training events.  A list of completed PBT events must be provi ded.   V.  TASK DESCRIPTIONS Prior to the first PBT session, the Contractor will provide input, as necessary, into the selection of the plants that will participate in the second PBT.  The Contractor will also provide guidance relative to the assignment of facilitators to individual f acilities, if necessary.   The Contractor will jointly coordinate five (5) PBT sessions, over a time span of 12-18 months with six (6) to ten (10) plants participating.  During this period, the Contractor shall, to the maximum extent practicable, provide the benefits of his knowledg e and practical experience in water treatment to the facilitators in an effort to incorporate positive changes at six (6) to ten (10) individual water treatment plants in the state of Louisiana.  The Contractor is expected to provide one (1) trainer at all  five (5) quarterly sessions.  The Corps will serve as the second trainer for all five (5) quarterly sessions.  In between training sessions, the Contractor shall provide guidance to the plant facilitators in the their efforts with individual plants (inclu ding one conference calls between sessions), as necessary.   The Contractor shall provide an outline of each session approximately three (3) months prior to each session, for review by the Corps/LDHH team.  The location of the training sessions will be coo rdinated by the Corps/LDHH team, with some of the sessions to be held at participating facilities in order to incorporate hands-on efforts during the sessions. The Contractor shall provide a one-day (8 hour long) orientation on the roles and expectations of a facilitator.  This orientation shall be provided prior to the first PBT training session.  This orientation may take place just prior to the first PBT sessi on at a time and location mutually agreed upon by the Contractor and the Corps/LDHH. Each of the plants that agree to participate in the PBT will be informed of the requirements of their participation by the Corps/LDHH team.  The requirements include, but are not limited to, the following: continuous on line turbidimeters on individual fil ters, jar testing equipment, access to a computer with spreadsheet capability, commitment to send a minimum of two operators to all sessions, and commitment to send an administrator to the first and last session.  It shall be the responsibility of the Corp s/LDHH team to assure that plants are notified of the requirements for participation and are notified of the dates and locations of the sessions.  Outside of the five training sessions, no contact between the Contractor and individual facilities will be ex pected.  Any additional data that may be required from individual facilities during the PBT will be collected through the Corps/LDHH team.  The Corps/LDHH team will setup and coordinate the location of the training sessions. Efforts which will be addressed during the PBT sessions will include, but may not be limited to, the following: adoption of optimized performance goals, sampling, testing, a nd data development, special studies development, coagulation control, conducting jar testing, pump feed rates, chemical dosages, filter backwash procedures, and other operational guidelines.  In addition, guidance will be provided to individual water syst ems relative to other changes related to operation, maintenance, and administration factors.   Facilitators (Corps/LDHH/EPA Region 6) will be assigned one or more individual plants. As a part of the quarterly training sessions, the Contractor and facilitators will assist the individual plant staff in the development of “implementation plans” or “hom ework assignments” for the time period in between the training sessions.  The facilitators will follow up with their assigned plant(s) in between the sessions to keep them on track with their individual “implementation plans”.  This will be primarily accom plished through phone calls between the facilitators and plant staff, and periodically supplemented with site visits as needed.  The facilitators will document their contact with the plant staff.  This documentation will be compiled by the Corps and will b e provided to the Contractor for their review, comments, and direction.  Any coordination among the facilitators outside of the training sessions will be conducted through the Corps/LDHH team. The Contractor will be expected to provide review, comments and direction for all documents generated by the facilitators as a result of the PBT training sessions.   VI.  PERIOD OF SERVICES It is anticipated that the five PBT sessions will be attended by the Contractor, at mutually agreed upon dates, for a duration of 12-18 months (including efforts prior to the first training session).  One day (8 hours) will be allowed for the facilitator o rientation.  Three days (including travel) will be allowed for each of the five training sessions (including facilitator debriefing following sessions).  The Contractor will provide services during the PBT sessions as well as provide guidance to the facili tators related to phone calls, site visits, and other follow up, as well as consultation on any other issues related to assistance to the water plant as part of the training. VII.  MATERIAL TO BE PROVIDED BY THE CORPS Comprehensive Performance Evaluations (CPEs), when completed, for the facilities that will participate in the PBT will be provided upon request.  Performance Potential Graphs (PPGs) for the facilities that have not had CPEs will also be provided upon reque st. Documentation of plant selection criteria, site visits, or other information gathered by the Corps/LDHH team in relation to selection of plants to participate in the PBT will be provided upon request.

<DESC>This requirement was issued as a sole source RFQ procurement.  However, a complete data package was later found to be available.  As a result, this requirement was reassessed and found to be suitable for competitive procurement.  In addition, RFP procedures rather than RFQ procedures are deemed more appropriate to this type of procurement.  As a result, this RFQ is cancelled in its entirety.  It will be re-solicited as F09603-02-R-82094.

All offerors must acknowledge receipt of this Amendment by completing the information on Enclosure 1 of this letter and submitting it with their offer.  If an offeror has already submitte d its offer, it must still submit the last page of this letter acknowledging this amendment prior to the current Pre-Solicitation closing date, May 20, 2002. 	The following amendments are made to this Pre-Solicitation as announced on FedBizOps.  Addendum to 52.212-1, SECTION Va (2) is changed in its entirety to read: 	The offeror shall submit a separate Compensation Plan for each of the sample pricing requirements as the basis of the task order proposal.  Compensation Plans shall be submitted in detail for the base contract year.  For any option or award-term years, pr ovide only the base wage rate.     Addendum 52.212-2, Subfactor E3, the existing last sentence is deleted.  The following paragraph is added:   The use of non-compete conditions in employment agreements (to prevent loss of personnel by the contractor) effective only during the period of task order performance is acceptable.  However, the use of non-compete conditions in employment agreements that prevent employees of the incumbent from being employed, or accepting offers of employment, by the new contractor on the follow-on task order is unacceptable.  It hinders the government’s ability to accomplish the mission of providing medical care to benefi ciaries.  Inclusion of such conditions in an employer’s employment agreement will result in an offeror’s offer being unacceptable.

<CONTACT>Contact Program Office, See 'Description' for Name and Contact Information, Phone See 'Description, Fax See 'Description, Email See 'Description
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (ED) Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) proposes to enter into a purchase order for services from Johns Hopkins University to host, maintain, manage, and support the existing web-based, online reporting system for the Technology Innovation Challenge Grant (TICG) Program for a period of 12 months. 
 
OERI needs experts with the required knowledge, expertise, experience, and technological facilities to host, mange, and support the existing web-based TICG on line reporting system, to cover all annual performance reporting and closeouts by all TICG projects for the 2001-2002 one-year cycle supported with FY2001-funded TICG grants, enabling ED to review and use the data and report on GPRA.    The expert will maintain current projects in the system, add any new TICG projects to the system, and designate any projects that have ended as inactive, as directed by ED, providing access and technical assistance for current and new users, and terminating access to former users, as directed by ED.  The expert will manage access and security to protect the integrity of all information in the databases, and maintain backup files.  They will also be requried to communicate as necessary with ED, TICG project directors, and TICG project evaluators and to submit to ED all files, software, programming, architecture, source code, analysis tools, databases, forms, reports, features for searches, queries, sorts, and documentation necessary for the smooth transfer to and operation of the TICG online database system. 

OERI has identified the staff at the Johns Hopkins University as the only experts that can meet its requirements and carry out the work in the manner required.  The Johns Hopkins University staff are uniquely qualified to carry out the work of this purchase order, because they have developed the required in-depth understanding of the nature of the TICG Program and its projects, of the TICG Program reporting requirements and difficulties, and of the technical complexity of hosting, maintaining, managing, and supporting the existing web-based, online reporting system, and because they have the necessary technological facilities.

It is of critical importance that the contractor host, maintain, manage, and support the existing TICG web-based, online reporting system continuously without lapses in service.  ED estimates that transfer of the system to another contractor would take 6 months.  Any other contractor would cause a lapse in providing the required services because of start-up delays.  Because of their unique knowledge, expertise, and experience with the TICG Program and its web-based, online reporting system, and because they have the necessary technological facilities ready and do not need to take any preparatory steps to host, maintain, manage and support the TICG online reporting system, the Johns Hopkins University staff are the only staff who can provide the required services without start-up delays and without lapses in service. 

The Johns Hopkins University is uniquely positioned to provide the required services with no lapses in service and to keep Government costs low.  It would entail greater effort, greater expense, and significant delays, and it would result in poorer quality work if any other contractor had to begin learning about the TICG Program and its projects, reporting requirements and difficulties, and the technological complexities, and if any other contractor had to take the steps necessary to use its facilities to host, maintain, manage, and support the existing TICG online system.  

All responsible sources that believe they can accomplish this work may submit capability statements to Ronald Cartwright, OERI, Capital Place, 555 New Jersey Ave, NW, Washington, DC 20208, Ron.Carthwright@ed.gov, and Phone 202-219-2000 by 2:00 EST May 24, 2002.

The receivers will be connected to other TLM processing equipment in the same configuration as used by the LGS.  LGS staff will also be called upon to troubleshoot operations at ASN, so identical equipment is required in order to simulate and diagnose problems remotely.  In addition, these units must include two (2) years additional warranty and maintenance service in Australia.  Delivery shall be within 120 days after receipt of offer to Alice Springs, Australia.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the services and supplies  specified as a sole source from Microdyne Communication Technologies, Inc., 491 Oak Road, Ocala, Florida, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services and supplies are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement. See Note 22.

<DESC>Student and Exchange Visitor Program Technical Conferences

This communiqu? is for all government authorized institutions of higher education and exchange visitor programs in the United States who currently have enrolled foreign students and/or exchange visitors -- F, M, and J visa holders; and for any commercial business providing software or services regarding these visa holders to the aforementioned institutions.  

The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is currently developing the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) as an internet-based system designed to modernize and streamline the current process to bring foreign and exchange students and scholars to the United States. SEVIS provides the capability for electronic data collection on foreign students and exchange visitors -- F, M, and J visa holders - at government authorized institutions of higher education and exchange visitor programs in the United States. The INS, in partnership with the Department of State and the Department of Education, will direct the Program through which the INS plans to meet the statutory mandate under Section 641 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to collect information relating to non-immigrant foreign students andvisitor exchange visitor program participants.

The INS cordially invites you to a Technical Conference that will provide the SEVIS interface specifications for any institution wishing to continue to use their internal computer software to provide I-20 and DS-2019 related information to the INS.  INS will provide a technical overview of the batch-processingbatch processing interface requirements for SEVIS discussing the required transaction formats including the data elements for each event to be reported.  Any institutionInstitutions opting to enter the required information online through the SEVIS Real-time Interactive application at the INS website does not need to attend.  The conference session will be one full day at the Crystal City Marriott, 1999 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202 on June 13, 2002.

The conference session begins at 8:30 a.m. (includes a 30-minute registration) and continues until 5:00 p.m. with a lunch break from 11:30 to 1:00. Due to the limited space available, we must restrict attendance to one representative from each organization.  Also, no program-oriented, non-technical questions will be answered at this conference; .  it It is solely for transmitting technical specifications.  Therefore, it is strongly suggested that each institution's representative be from the information technology (IT) department and not a program office official.

To register, please provide your name, e-mail address, telephone number, and organization name. Forward this information by June 3, 2002 via e-mail to the INS in care of SEVPinfo@eds.com.  If you would like additional information on either SEVIS or the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, you may access the INS website at www.ins.usdoj.gov.

Subject: Request for Industry Comments. RFP USZA22-02-R-0005, USSOCOM Language Training Support. 

Dear Industry Partners,
 
The United States Special Operations Command is planning to purchase comprehensive language training support under an umbrella contract in support of all of SOF for these services. This includes the major components (Army, Air Force, Navy). This objective is to acquire these training services in accordance with the attached draft Statement of Work/Performance Work Statements (PWS). The PWS is not 100% complete at this time but that is because some valuable data is missing.  That data is your input.  We would like you, if you were interested to take time and submit your recommendations in making this a quality product. For instance, your comments on the type of contract vehicle and your comments on the structure of Schedule B are important to us. The Government normally dictates these areas. 

Our goal to you is to have a final solicitation posted in early June.   As you can see we are under a very tight schedule with the overall award(s) NLT 30 Sep 2002.  To do that we ask for your support in providing your input to us no later than 17 May 2002 for Government consideration.  Let me assure you that we will listen and consider your input seriously but we will make final decisions based on overall impact to our mission requirements. Please add your touch to this process.

The objectives we are trying to achieve for this contract are stated in the PWS, particularly Section 1.0 Scope. The main objective is to place the language training needs for all of the component commands within USSOCOM under one or perhaps up to two ?umbrella? contracts. The contract (s) will provide specific visibility into areas where duplication may be occurring and offer opportunities for cost savings. Proper management of the language training service contract will give a ?big picture? of total asset visibility and allow the Commander in Chief (CINC) and subordinates to make better and more informed decisions. Some of the areas that I, as the Contracting Officer would like particular feedback on is as follows:

(a) Part of our initial determination is whether the government will reserve this action for small business as a set-aside. The overall management structure for contract performance seems considerable.  

 	(b) The contract resulting from this solicitation will be considered a Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract with some minor variations as designated in Section B. The contract will be awarded for base period of five (5) ordering periods, with the potential for four incentive award term extensions.  Section B at this time only contains the base year.  We want your input before we finalize the out years for this solicitation.   

(c) For planning purposes, an industry briefing and individual one-on-one sessions (with prime companies only for one-on-one) the date and destination for this has not been establish but will be held in the near future. The briefing will require attendees to be cleared to a minimum SECRET clearance.  If this posses as a problem please notify us as soon as possible.  

(d) The Government plans to require the contractor to be accredited, as stated in Section 1.3 of the PWS. Your opinion on this matter is solicited.   

	For purposes of this contract, the term "user" is defined as any person, including but not limited to members of the uniformed services, civilian Government employees, and contractor personnel requiring services under this contract.
