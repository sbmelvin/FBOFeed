The equipment is required for the deployable 500-man camps that are part of the Capability Package (CP) 5A0156 "NATO Deployable HQ Assets for Deployable 500-man camps."
<p>In order to bid on this project, a U.S. prime contractor must 1) maintain a professionally active facility (office, factory, laboratory, etc.) in the United States, 2) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB), and 3) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government.</p>

This equipment and material will be used in rapidly deployable headquarters for NATO military forces over a wide range of geographic environments and climatic conditions. Accordingly, NATO expects the equipment to be robust and of high quality, capable of being mounted and dismounted, unpacked and repacked at camp sites rapidly and often, under difficult climate and terrain conditions. These items will be:</p>

<p>h) expected to perform reliable service without loss of function at any time during deployed exercises and operational periods</p>
<p>i) integrated in several different camps.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list for this procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB.

<DESC>REQUIREMENT:
The FAA has a current requirement for the maintenance and training support of Smiths Detection 5030si HI-SCAN X-Ray Inspection Systems machines at approximately 50 locations throughout the continental United States.  Vendors are requested to demonstrate experience and capabilities of providing maintenance and training for Smiths Detection Model Hi Scan 5030si machines.  Substitution with like items is not acceptable.  Therefore, the FAA is conducting this market survey to seek potential sources capable of meeting technical and delivery requirements.  Specific requirements are identified in the Market Survey - Draft Statement of Work, attached.  Any vendor that believes it can provide these services is invited to submit a capability statement (in contractor format) addressing its abilities to meet all of the requirements identified below and in the attached Market Survey - Draft Statement of Work.

A subsequent, follow on acquisition for both X-Ray Machine hardware along with maintenance and training to support such hardware is anticipated.  It is the FAAs intention that this subsequent, follow on acquisition will not be brand or product specific. Any contract that results from this market survey request will act as a bridge for such an anticipated future acquisition.
  
Any bridge contract that may result from this market survey is anticipated to be a Firm-Fixed Price, Contract with a base period of performance of one (1) year and one (1), one (1) year option period.

At this time the nature of any final competition for a bridge contract that may result from this market survey has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of an anticipated procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standard code for this requirement is 334517 with a size standard of 500 employees.

All responses (one per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 5 typewritten pages, excluding the Business Declaration form and SBA certification documentation. No type font less than 11 point may be used.

PURPOSE:	
This market survey is designed to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.

REQUIREMENTS FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST:
The FAA requires proof of documentation from interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and from eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a) Program.

In order to make this determination and to be considered responsive, the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:
a. Capability Statement (addressing the ability to meet all the requirements identified in the Market Survey - Draft Statement of Work)

b. Completed Business Declaration Form (attached)

c. Copy of SBA 8(a) Certification Form or proof of documentation from service-disabled veteran-owned small business (if applicable).

Pre-Solicitation Notice:
PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  The Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) on behalf of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), intends to competitively award a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) type of contract as a result of this notice.  There are no set aside restrictions.  The BSEE, Acquisition Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement and the resulting contract administration. All potential Offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at www.sam.gov in order to receive Government awards.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services. The estimated budget range is between $572,000.00 and $602,000.00.  The period of performance of the resultant contract is expected to be 7 months from the date of award. 
Under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), as amended, (43 U.S.C. 1331-1356a.) and its implementing regulations, BOEM may authorize geological and geophysical (G&G) activities and the collection of G&G data.  The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has authority under section 101(a)(5)(A) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.), which directs the Secretary of Commerce to allow, upon request, the incidental, but not intentional, taking of marine mammals by U.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity (other than commercial fishing) within a specified geographical region if certain findings are made and regulations are issued. Pursuant to the regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), BOEM and NMFS are preparing a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) to evaluate potential environmental effects of multiple geological and geophysical (G&G) activities in OCS waters of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), extending from the coastline to the seaward boundary of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), including the GOM Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  In order to complete the PEIS analysis, acoustic propagation and marine mammal exposure modeling is necessary.  
The purpose of this project is to perform acoustic propagation and marine mammal exposure modeling using specified models.  This study will help BOEM and NMFS complete the analysis of impacts to marine mammals in the GOM G&G EIS.  This modeling will also be used in a petition for rulemaking under 101(a)(5)(A) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act and will aid in the analysis that NMFS will need to make a determination on permit issuance.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Shealy Environmental Services to perform sample analysis on both water and soil extracts for chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) and metals. Numerous samples (176 aqueous and 302 methanol (MeOH)/water mixture samples) need to be analyzed for CVOCs using EPA Method 8260B (purge and trap GC/MS), and 88 aqueous samples for metals using EPA Method 6010C (ICP-AES) (without mercury).  These data will be used to assess the level of contamination in ground water and soil samples collected at the Parris Island, S.C., Marine Corp Recruit Depot.  EPA has identified Shealy Environmental Services as the only contractor able to provide these services.  These samples and the data received are part of an In Situ Chemical Oxidation Project already in process.  Shealy Environmental Services has already provided sample analysis and data results on numerous samples under this project.  It has been determined that additional rounds of ground water and soil sampling are needed to complete the project. Use of Shealy Environmental Services will eliminate variability in analytical results, and allow valid comparisons between sample sets used to assess ground water fate and transport and ISCO treatment performance .   A change in analytical laboratories for each of the sampling events will introduce a source of variability that cannot be discerned between different sample sets. It will be unclear whether differences are attributed to analytical variability between laboratories, or the actual treatment. Further, the results of this study will be peer reviewed and published in the scientific peer-reviewed literature. Peer reviewers can be particularly harsh involving analytical variability for the reasons discussed above. 
This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12 Commercial Procedures.  It is our intent to award a single fixed price purchase order by March 12, 2014. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETATIVE QUOTATIONS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit documentation to the office identified in this notice.  Documentation must be submitted within 14 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice.  Submit your request in writing to David Plagge at the address shown above or email at plagge.david@epa.gov.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development, Regional Development Mission in Asia (USAID/RDMA) intends to release a solicitation for an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) through which USAID Missions in the Asia region can easily access services.  The IQC will be awarded to a single contractor  that may be either an organization or firm from an assistance-eligible country in Asia, or a US organization or firm, with capability to provide capacity development services directly in countries where such services are needed.  The contractor will provide local capacity development expertise in any country where a task order to which they respond is initiated.
<p>There is currently no incumbent contractor performing the work.</p>
<p>USAID launched an ambitious reform agenda in 2010, USAID Forward, to ensure that the Agency and its partners efficiently, effectively and inclusively address the global challenges of today and achieve results that outlast its assistance in the future.  One of USAID Forward's key objectives is the Local Solutions initiative, an ambitious effort to increase the impact of USAID's foreign assistance by working directly with local NGOs and government.  The Local Solutions objective focuses on developing the capacity of local development organizations and host country partners to increase aid effectiveness and sustainability. Local Solutions recognizes that to respond successfully and sustainably to today's development challenges, we must harness each country's unique assets and promote conditions where local actors meet their own development needs.</p>
<p>The purpose of &lsquo;Support Services for Local Solutions' is to provide local capacity development assistance in the areas of technical/and or advisory services to local USAID implementing partners and stakeholders in the Asia region.  Specific capacity development areas of intervention will be determined by the particular needs of the local entity or sector being targeted.  Capacity development services in general will focus at the individual/team level (i.e. building the knowledge and skills of individuals and teams) and at the organizational level (e.g. strengthening structures, tools, policies, procedures, and practices).  The Contractor(s) shall provide on-site support and must tailor training and technical assistance to ensure the most useful and appropriate assistance possible for each targeted entity.</p>
<p>A broad range of capacity development services will be acquired.  While individualized support required will vary depending on need as specified in individual task orders, activities the Contractor(s) may perform include - but are not limited to - conduct research &amp; analysis; organizational development market improvement; assessment &amp; measurement services tools; capacity development planning services; other capacity building needs .</p>
<p>The countries that may be assisted through this IQC can include any of the USAID assistance eligible countries in Asia, comprising Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Burma (Myanmar), Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Krygyzstan, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Tajikstan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Except for the above information, no additional information regarding this planned RFP is available at this time. All necessary information will be supplied at the time the RFP is posted at www.fbo.gov.  Questions/requests for information will not be responded to until RFP issuance. Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the above website for updates concerning this procurement. No proposals for funding should be submitted until after the RFP is issued.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate USAID to release a solicitation or award a contract nor does it commit the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal.  In addition, final award cannot be made until funds have been fully appropriated, allocated, and committed and internal USAID procedures have been completed. This notice satisfies the synopsis requirement in FAR 5.201.</p>

<DESC><p>&nbsp;Request for Proposals Notice for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) for the states of Colorado, Montana, Utah, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming (GSA, PBS Region 8)</p>
<p>This requirement is set-aside 100% for 8(a) business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this project is: 236220 and the size standard is $33.5 million.</p>
<p>GSA anticipates issuing the Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about the first week of March 2014 with receipt of proposals around the beginning of April 2014.</p>
<p>GSA anticipates awarding multiple contracts (one contract per successful offeror) as a result of the solicitation. Contracts will be for one (1) base year with options for four (4) additional years. Total contract length with base and all options exercised is five (5) years. Contractors will be expected to compete for design-bid-build general contractor duties. Offerors receiving an award as a result of this solicitation will be eligible, but not required, to place offers on all task orders issued under this contract.</p>
<p>The maximum value (total of the base and all option periods) of each contract awarded as a result of this solicitation is $20,000,000. The contract award minimum guarantee amount will be $5,000 and shall be over the life of each contract. Individual task orders will not exceed $2.5 million dollars without the contractor's consent. However, a typical task order issued as a result of this contract will be between $5,000 and $150,000. Solicitation for any subsequent Task Order (TO) issued under these contracts will primarily be competitive Request for Proposals (RFP).</p>
<p>This is a competitive negotiated acquisition. Proposals (Technical and Price) will be evaluated by the Government using source selection procedures. The Government intends to use the best value concept in making the selections. The best value concept is a method of evaluating technical qualifications and price as specified in the solicitation which in the Government's estimation provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror. Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted. The Government may make an award without discussions. Therefore, offerors will be requested to submit initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.</p>
<p>This solicitation will utilize procedures in accordance with FAR 15, Best Value Trade-off Process and it is anticipated that multiple IDIQ contracts will be awarded. Proposal submission instructions will be included in the solicitation package.</p>
<p>Two proposal packages will be considered: a technical evaluation package and price proposal. The evaluation factors that comprise the technical proposal package are, in descending order of importance: (1) Past Performance, (2) Technical Capabilities (3) Price Factor. The technical factors are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>The procurement will include a wide range of construction projects over the period of performance utilizing the design-bid-build task order contract approach. Primarily, task orders will consist of repair/alteration and tenant finish projects for the GSA and other government agencies in occupied federally owned or leased buildings. A typical task order could contain some or all of the following: modifications to architectural components and related electrical systems associated with, but not limited to ceilings, walls, floors (including access floor systems), roofing systems, millwork and wall covering. Work may also include modifications and replacement of mechanical systems to include, but not be limited to: air handling units, chillers, boilers, ductwork systems and accessories, piping systems (including pumps), HVAC system controls, fire protection sprinkler systems and accessories, and plumbing equipment/accessories. In addition, scope may also include work on electrical systems including, but not limited to lighting systems, primary and secondary power distribution systems and transformers. Special competencies will be required for any work involving membrane roofing, asbestos abatement, PCB removal and/or elevator work. Interested parties must be capable of providing the services associated with the aforementioned competencies.</p>
<p>Interested offerors must be registered in Systems for Award Management (SAM). To register go to: https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. You will need your DUNS number to register. Instructions for registering are on the web page. The solicitation and associated information will be available from the Federal Business Opportunities system (FedBizOpps.gov or fbo.gov) contractors and subcontractors interested in this project must register at this site.</p>
<p>The base contract and task orders issued as a result of this solicitation will include Buy American Act clauses. As a result, one or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.</p>
<p>The Government will require that contractors performing work and maintain a bona fide office in the state of Colorado and are incorporated within the five state areas of Utah, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.</p>
<p>Solicitation documents will be available electronically around the first week of March 2014, at the following website: www.fedbizopps.gov. Offerors should search for solicitation GS-08P-14-JB-D-0020 to access solicitation documents and any amendments. INTERESTED PARTIES ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF ACTIONS INCLUDING POSTING OF THE SOLICITATION AND ANY AMENDMENTS. HOWEVER, OFFERORS ARE ADVISED TO CHECK THE SIGHT FREQUENTLY AS THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING AMENDMENTS.</p>
<p><strong>No telephone or facsimile requests will be accepted.</strong></p>

The estimated construction cost per project is between approximately $3,000,000 and $50,000,000.   <br>  <br> Up to four firms will be selected, the top ranked firm will be awarded the first contract, the second ranked firm will be awarded the second, and so on. Award of all contracts will be made within nine (9) months after award of the first contract provided there is sufficient workload.  If necessary, secondary selection criteria will be used as a tiebreaker between firms considered as technically equal.  The following factors will be used in deciding which offeror will be selected to negotiate task orders: performance and quality of deliverables, current capacity to accomplish the work in the required time, and uniquely specialized experience.  Significant emphasis will be placed on the A/E's quality control procedures, as the District will perform the quality assurance role only.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice or any follow up information requests.</p>
<p>Interested parties should submit their responses via email to Janet Mata-Hitz at jmata@loc.gov and Shameema Rahman at srah@loc.gov. Capabilities statements should be limited to no longer than 15 pages. It must include the following information:</p>
<p>1) Company Name, DUNS Number, Address, Point of Contact, phone number and email address;<br />2) Corporate structure (corporation, LLC, sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability partnership, professional corporation, etc.);<br />3) References, including name, phone number and email address of individuals who can verify the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses;<br />4) A statement as to whether the firm is interested in working as a prime contractor or a subcontractor;<br />5) A demonstration of the vendor's technology and its ability to meet LC's objectives. (See Item III, Capability Statements and Item IV. Sample Response Outline, below.)</p>
<p>II. Background</p>
<p>1. Overview</p>
<p>A. Print Management at the Library of Congress<br />The Library of Congress anticipates posting a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a 5 year (12-month base period plus 4 option years) fixed-price contract in Fall, 2014, for print management services.</p>
<p>The RFP will have 3 core components:</p>
<p>1) Network public fee for service print management in three Service Units: <br />a. Library Services public reading rooms (approx. 24), b. Copyright Office and the <br />c. Law Library. <br />Note: Reading Rooms are located in three separate, yet adjacent, buildings on Capitol Hill.<br /><br />2) Office copying/printing that functions as an internal charge back program; and</p>
<p>3) Internal charge-back production print shop.</p>
<p><br />B. Public Reading Rooms in the Library of Congress<br />This RFI relates solely to item 1 above &lsquo;Networked public fee for service print management in the reading rooms (Library Services, Copyright Office and Law Library)' in which it is anticipated will introduce a fundamental change to the way the Library manages its public printing, copying, and scanning services. A key outcome of the future contract is to establish a feature-rich, fee based print management environment in the many reading rooms of the Library of Congress. Objectives include:</p>
<p>&bull; Greatly reducing the inventory of desktop printers; <br />&bull; transitioning from analog equipment to digital; <br />&bull; networking all imaging equipment to establish demand, volume, and cost; <br />&bull; simplifying an overly complex and costly print environment that has resulted from an unmanaged accumulation of equipment, supplies, and support; <br />&bull; reducing overhead costs associated with paper and ink;<br />&bull; improving available services to include industry-standard services such as color, secure printing, scanning, scan-to-email etc.</p>
<p>III. Capability Statement</p>
<p>The capability statement should briefly describe the company's expertise, experience, and understanding of each of the following areas:</p>
<p>A. A PMS that Reduces Cost &amp; Increases Flexibility <br />While service quality is essential, the Library is also seeking to control and lower total cost. Respondents should provide suggestions around alternate costing arrangements that would lower the Library's total cost of ownership. Examples may include purchasing, renting, leasing, volume pricing or discounts, and &lsquo;no cost contract' (i.e., vendor assumes all cost, and all revenue)</p>
<p>B. A PMS Responsive to Public Services, Industry Standards, and Revenue Generation <br />The Library currently charges a fee for photocopying and microfilm printing in the reading rooms. Additionally, the Library needs the ability to charge for PC printing, and for scanning. As a revenue-generating activity, the Library is making assumptions about a print management solution:<br />&bull; Black and white printing has been declining for over a decade and will continue to do so<br />&bull; Networking printing in the reading rooms will automatically reduce use by 50% <br />&bull; Color printing and copying will increase, as it would be a new service<br />&bull; On-site printing will increasingly be replaced by scanning options, and the library must have the option to track and charge for equipment usage <br />&bull; The Library will require a &lsquo;dumb card' initially but would ideally migrate to credit card and/or smartcard use in the future<br />&bull; Estimated yearly print volumes in Reading Rooms: <br />o Desktop print impressions: 2,000,000<br />o Copier impressions (B/W): 540,000<br />o Microfilm impression: 50,000<br />o Scanning impressions: unknown</p>
<p><br />IV. Sample Response Outline</p>
<p>Following is a suggested outline for Respondents to use in submitting their capability statements, and for Oral Presentations, if invited (See Item V. Oral Presentations, below).</p>
<p><br />A. Section 1 - System Architecture<br />Briefly describe the architectural concepts for the proposed system. This should include a high-level conceptual diagram of the major IT steps, components, and technology included in the proposed solution.</p>
<p><br />B. Section 2 - Solution Integration <br />A demonstration of the integration, operation, and maintenance of third-party software and hardware required.<br />Provide examples of pricing practices especially in large government or research organizations. Provide suggested price points for various functions.</p>
<p>C. Section 3 - Implementation Methodology<br />Vendors should provide high-level planning documentation, addressing concept of operations, system design, and implementation, providing an outline of significant high-level milestones with approximate timeframes for this type of project.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
United States Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (USEITI)
Background: The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is a global standard that promotes transparency and accountability in the oil, gas and mining sectors. It has a robust yet flexible methodology for disclosing and reconciling company payments and government revenues.  EITI implementation has two core components:
-Transparency: oil, gas and mining companies disclose their payments to the government, and the government discloses its receipts. The figures will be reconciled by an Independent Administrator (e.g. Contractor), and published in annual EITI Reports alongside contextual and other information about the extractive sector. - Accountability: a multi-stakeholder group (MSG) with representatives from government, companies and civil society was established and will oversee the process and communicate the findings of the EITI Report, and promote the integration of EITI into broader transparency efforts in that country.
Seven requirements for implementing countries are set out in the EITI Standard1. Additional information is available online at: www.eiti.org
The Secretary of the Department of the Interior is the senior U.S. government official responsible for the implementation of USEITI. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) within the Department of the Interior coordinates the efforts to convene the MSG and manages the day-to-day implementation of USEITI. ONRR, in coordination with the MSG, is responsible for managing the USEITI Independent Administrator contract. To learn more about our ongoing efforts to implement USEITI and to view the U.S. Candidacy Application please visit: www.doi.gov/eiti
Purpose: This RFI offers the opportunity for interested companies to provide recommendations on approaches for how the U.S. can issue its first USEITI report in compliance with EITI requirements and successfully become an EITI compliant country. Based on the EITI requirement listed below, please describe how your company is qualified to fulfill the EITI requirements.
Requirements:
- Conduct a review of the work the MSG has completed to establish the scope of the USEITI reporting process, the reporting templates, data collection procedures, and the schedule for publishing the USEITI Report. It is imperative that the scope of USEITI reporting is clearly defined, in line with the EITI Standard and with the MSG's agreed objectives and expectations for the USEITI process. - Distribute the reporting templates to reporting companies and government agencies, and collect the completed forms, data files, and associated supporting documentation, as well as any contextual or other information requested to be collected directly from the participating reporting entities. - Reconcile the information disclosed by the reporting entities, identifying any discrepancies (including offsetting discrepancies) in accordance with the agreed scope, and prepare an initial reconciliation report based on the reported unadjusted data. - Prepare contextual information about the extractive industries including but not limited to: a description of the applicable legal framework and fiscal regime; an overview of the industry overview that includes information about its economic and other contributions, leases held, the nature and scope of contracts, and relevant information about beneficial ownership; production data from federal and state lands; state revenue data; and revenue allocations and the sustainability of revenues at the federal and state levels. - Publish and make public the final USEITI report on a website established for this purpose.
Questions regarding the vendor and their product: (Vendors should address each question, in their responses.)
- Do you have experience in any aspect of EITI reporting in any other country? Provide a link or an electronic sample of your work. - Do you have experience submitting timely annual reports regarding financial performance, reconciliation of revenues, or other similarly related issues that are comprehensive, understandable, and made widely available and accessible to the public? Provide a link or an electronic sample of your work. - What are best practices for producing a fully compliant EITI report or similar report? - Have you recently, within the past 24 months prepared a scoping or feasibility study such as an environmental impact assessment, economic assessment, regulatory assessment, or other multi-faceted analysis for an extractive industry such as oil, gas, mining, or other resources? Provide a link or an electronic sample of your work. - Do you have experience documenting the government's policy on disclosure of contracts and licenses that govern the exploration and exploitation of oil, gas and minerals which would include identifying relevant laws, regulations, and financial systems that govern the extractive sector? Provide a link or an electronic sample of your work. - Do you have any contracts or other financial interests with any oil, gas, or mining company that may generate revenues from Federal lands and waters? If so, explain how you might handle the conflict of interest should your company seek to perform USEITI work. - What mechanisms would you use to ensure independence and non-partisan approaches to reconciling and reporting? - Do you have experience working with multi-stakeholder or multi-sectoral bodies or committees with diverse interests who will be integral to conducting USEITI work? Provide examples. - Do you have experience managing, analyzing, and translating complex and often dry financial data into easily understandable, compelling, and usable formats for the public? The public may include the general public, non-profits, community groups, local governments, state governments, and small to large companies. - Do you have experience designing and developing user-facing websites that explain complex information in engaging ways? Provide examples. - Do you have experience developing lightweight web applications that use modern, standards- compliant technologies to share and visualize data? Provide examples. - Do you have experience using and contributing to open source code and frameworks? We are most interested in those that relate to data wrangling, user-facing interaction and visualization. Provide examples. - Please provide any additional information you think is relevant to developing the USEITI report.
Timeline goals: - Anticipated contract award date is July 31, 2014. - Issue the first USEITI report in December 2015 based on 2013 data in accordance with the EITI Standard.
Vendor response may include the following:
- Company name and address with point of contact, email and phone number. - DUNS number. - Socioeconomic Status e.g., small business, veteran owned small business, woman owned small business, large business, etc.
- Specific and relevant information related to the requirements of this project that will enable the Government to determine the capabilities of the company. - Vendor responses shall not exceed a total of ten (10) pages, singles-spaced, 1 inch margins, and font size Times New Roman 12.
Response Instructions - Submit response electronically no later than 12:00 pm (MST) on March 7, 2014. Questions regarding this RFI will be accepted until February 28, 2013, close of business.  All questions must be directed to Anthony Jasper at 303-969-5750, or electronically at anthony_jasper@ibc.doi.gov. - Disclaimer:  This RFI is being published as a means for the Government to obtain relevant market information to use in developing an acquisition strategy. Responses to this RFI will not be viewed as a binding commitment to develop or purse the requirement. - We anticipate utilizing NAICS code 541211 for this acquisition.

<SUBJECT>Trinidad Head Atmospheric Baseline Observatory Management & Operation
<SOLNBR>THD2014-201900155
<RESPDATE>030514
<CONTACT>Mark Caban, Phone 303-497-6875, Fax 303-497-3163, Email mark.caban@noaa.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are seeking sources capable of performing the requirements necessary to  maintain the Trinidad Head Observatory facility (THD) and instrumentation year round; site must be staffed 7 days a week to verify instrumentation, security, calibrations, and maintenance.  The mission is to acquire, evaluate and make available accurate, long-term records of atmospheric gases, aerosol particles, and solar radiation in a manner that allows the causes of the change to be understood. The Government is especially interested in responses from SBA certified small business concerns that are capable of performing the work described within this notice.
<p>Trinidad Head Observatory (THD) is located on a point jutting into the ocean along the remote northern coast of California approximately 40 km (25 miles) north of Eureka, California, and the main regional population center.  To the immediate west of Trinidad Head is the unobstructed Pacific Ocean and to the east are redwood-dominated forestlands.  Because of the characteristics of a relatively remote coastal location (insignificant anthropogenic influences and prevailing maritime airflow) the Trinidad Head site is an important location, providing an opportunity to observe and monitor both regional and global influences.</p>
<p>An instrument trailer was installed in April 2002 allowing measurements of aerosols, surface ozone, radiation, and flask sampling for halocarbons and carbon cycle gases. Bi-weekly airborne vertical profile measurements will provide a continuous baseline of pollution and climate forcing agents in air entering the U.S. Already, at this location, Scripps Institution of Oceanography is operating two in situ instruments that complement the NOAA measurements, one as part of the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE), the other for measuring changes in atmospheric oxygen concentrations.</p>
<p>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:<br />Instrument suite is highly specialized and requires a skilled technician to operate.  The government does not provide training on the instrumentation. Vehicle access to Trinidad Head is gated and the City of Trinidad issues the key. Vehicle access is required by the contractor to meet the NOAA mission at Trinidad Head.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all supervision, material, and labor necessary to maintain the THD. The anticipated period of performance is a one-year base period with four-one year option periods.</p>
<p>The planned work may include, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>Maintain the observatory facility and instrumentation year round; site must be staffed 7 days a week to verify instrumentation, security, calibrations, and maintenance.</p>
<p>Facility maintenance includes, but not limited to, general upkeep and rust mitigation for the NOAA trailer, tower, and electric vehicle.</p>
<p>Instrument operations include:<br />1. Condensation Nuclei Counter (CNC).<br />&bull; A CNC is used to measure particle number concentrations. Particles are drawn into the CNC and vapor is condensed on the particles so that they grow to a size detectable by the instrument optics and thus can be counted.  <br />2. Aerosol Nephelometer, Pump Box and associated electronics.<br />&bull; The TSI nephelometer (TSI Model#3563) measures total scattering (between 7 and 170 degrees) and backscattering (between 90 and 170 degrees) by aerosol particles at three wavelengths: blue (450 nm), green (550 nm) and red (700 nm).<br />3. Aerosol air-intake stack and blower.<br />&bull; Specially designed aerosol stack and inlet system that provides excellent sampling efficiency for sub-10um aerosol. It is less effective for ultra-fine aerosol. The high sample flow (150 lpm) allows for multiple instruments to get their sample from the same inlet.<br />4. Meteorology system (data logger, wind, pressure, temp, relative humidity).<br />&bull; Coastal Environmental data logger connected to RM Young 05103 wind bird, Setra Pressure model 270 sensor, Logan Enterprises platinum resistance probes (temp), and a Vaisala HMP50 relative humidity probe.<br />5.NASA Micropulse LIDAR.<br />&bull; The NASA Micro Pulse Lidar Network (MPLNET) (Welton et al., 2001) is a federated network of Micro Pulse Lidar (MPL) systems designed to measure aerosol and cloud vertical structure continuously, day and night, over long time periods required to contribute to climate change studies and provide ground validation for models and satellite sensors in the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS).<br />6. Solar Radiation Array.<br />&bull; The Precision Spectral Pyranometer is a World Meteorological Organization First Class Radiometer designed for the measurement of sun and sky radiation, totally or in defined broad wavelength bands. It comprises a circular multi-junction wire-wound Eppley thermopile, which has the ability to withstand severe mechanical vibration and shock. Its receiver is coated with Parson's black lacquer (non wavelength selective absorption). This instrument is supplied with a pair of removable precision ground and polished hemispheres of Schott optical glass. Both hemispheres are made of clear WG295 glass, which is uniformly transparent to energy between 0.285 to 2.8&micro;m.<br />&bull; The Precision Infrared Radiometer, Pyrgeometer, is intended for unidirectional operation in the measurement, separately, of incoming or outgoing terrestrial radiation as distinct from net long-wave flux. The PIR comprises a circular multi-junction wire-wound Eppley thermopile that has the ability to withstand severe mechanical vibration and shock. Its receiver is coated with Parson's black lacquer (non-wavelength selective absorption). Temperature compensation of detector response is incorporated. Radiation emitted by the detector in its corresponding orientation is automatically compensated, eliminating that portion of the signal. A battery voltage, precisely controlled by a thermistor, which senses detector temperature continuously, is introduced into the principle electrical circuit.  Isolation of long-wave radiation from solar short-wave radiation in daytime is accomplished by using a silicone dome. The inner surface of this hemisphere has a vacuum-deposited interference filter with a transmission range of approximately 3.5 to 50 &micro;m. <br />7. CIMEL robotic sun photometer.<br />&bull; The AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) program is a federation of ground-based remote sensing aerosol networks established by NASA and PHOTONS (Univ. of Lille 1, CNES, and CNRS-INSU) and is greatly expanded by collaborators from national agencies, institutes, universities, individual scientists, and partners. The system provides a long-term, continuous and readily accessible public domain database of aerosol optical, microphysical and radiative properties for aerosol research and characterization, validation of satellite retrievals, and synergism with other databases. AERONET collaboration provides globally distributed observations of spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD), inversion products, and precipitable water in diverse aerosol regimes. Aerosol optical depth data are computed for three data quality levels: Level 1.0 (unscreened), Level 1.5 (cloud-screened), and Level 2.0 (cloud-screened and quality-assured). Inversions, precipitable water, and other AOD-dependent products are derived from these levels and may implement additional quality checks.<br />8. TEI surface ozone detector.<br />&bull; Near ground level ozone is currently monitored using ultraviolet absorption photometers (TEI model 49i) at &gt;0.5ppb precision at eight sites that are generally representative of background global conditions. These sites, including Trinidad Head, provide information on possible long-term changes in tropospheric ozone near the surface.<br />9. Greenhouse Gas Flask sampling pump, glass flasks, and shipping supplies.<br />&bull; The Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network measures the atmospheric distribution and trends of the three main long-term drivers of climate change, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as carbon monoxide (CO) which is an important indicator of air pollution. The network is a part of NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado. The measurement program includes around the clock measurements at 4 baseline observatories and 8 tall towers, air samples collected by volunteers at more than 50 sites, and air samples collected regularly from small aircraft mostly in North America. The air samples are returned to Boulder for analysis. All measurements of up to ~55 trace gases are subject to stringent quality control procedures, and are directly traceable to internationally accepted calibration scales where possible. Measurements are made in custom glass flasks and filled by NOAA designed and built pump boxes deployed to all field locations. <br />10. Logistical support/supplies for other episodic sampling campaigns conducted by NOAA as well as non-NOAA entities (partners).</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541990, Professional, Scientific and Technical Services and the small-business size standard is $14.0.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding a fixed-price service contract for maintaining the THD.</p>
<p>This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. Nor does this request for information constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise that any procurement action that may be issued for the Government's requirements related to any THD maintenance.</p>
<p>No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of contractor's information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Please submit information to include:</p>
<p>1) Your firm's DUNS number &amp; CAGE code;<br />2) Your firm's SBA certified small business concern status. Specifically identify if your firm is HUBZone-certified, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, or SBA 8(a) program certified;<br />3) A brief description of your firm's recent past experience (within past 3 years) performing complex similar work as described above;<br />4) Identify from the list of major work components above those that your firm would likely subcontract out. Any subsequent contract will contain the mandatory FAR clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, which limits subcontracting costs to 50% of the price of the contract.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement for a construction project for Repairs to the East Jetty at Block Island Harbor of refuge, Block Island, Rhode Island to determine interest, availability and capability of HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Small Business concerns.  Work is expected to begin in October 2014 and all work, including site restoration, must be completed by March 31, 2015.  The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. <br>  <br> Block Island Harbor of Refuge is located on the east side of Block Island, RI about 13 miles southwest of Point Judith Harbor, Rhode Island, and about 25 miles southeast of Stonington Harbor, Connecticut.  The proposed work involves repairing those sections of the east breakwater that were damaged by Hurricane Sandy in late October 2012 and will involve mobilizing heavy construction equipment, large armor stone, and other project materials to Block Island by water. <br>   <br> The repair work will involve reconstructing the breakwater to pre-storm conditions including side slopes and crest height.  Although equipment and materials will be delivered to the site via water, it is expected that the repair work will be largely conducted from the crest and within the foot-print of the existing structure.  The quantity of stone to be placed is currently estimated to include approximately 2400 tons.  A fairly large amount of displaced stone is expected to be recovered from the site adjacent to the breakwater, especially near the trunk and head of the structure.  New stone will also be required and that stone will be brought from offsite sources. The existing stone size of the structure varies widely and new stone needed to repair the structure is expected to range in size on the trunk (middle) from 10-14 tons and on the head (tip) from 18-22 tons.   Various sections of the breakwater will require  quote mark dismantling quote mark  prior to rebuilding with new stone so that pre-storm elevations and side slopes can be matched and the very large armor stone can be properly aligned and interlocked.  Work is expected to commence just after October 1, 2014 and be completed NLT March 31, 2015.   <br> Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following:  business classification (i.e. small business) as well as demonstrating qualifications and experience with performing at least 3 projects involving construction/repair of similar massive stone structures such as seawalls, stone breakwaters, and jetties. Responses are due March 11, 2014 by 5:00pm EST.  Responses should also include experience of Foreman and Crane Operators working on massive stone structures. Subcontractors may be used to demonstrate this past experience.  Proof of bonding capability is required.  Responses are limited to twenty pages.  Responses should be emailed to Susan Dunnagan at Susan.K.Dunnagan@usace.army.mil.  Contact her at 978-318-8060 with questions.   Interested firms shall provide the above documentation in one original form and one copy.  The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided.  This is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.

The dredging work will include the main FNC, an anchorage located in the East River, approximately 100 feet by 1500 feet,  and the 55 foot wide, 800 feet long Sluice Creek Channel which connects the Guilford marina to the main FNC.  In addition to these areas, the Town of Guilford marina will also be dredged.  Dredging the marina will require the removal and replacement of all water-based marina components including the following: 46 dock sections (6 feet x 20 feet), 58 finger piers (2 feet x 17 feet), water and electrical services to all docks, and the removal and replacement of approximately 62 12-inch diameter timber piles ranging in length from 30-40 feet.  The marina components will be stored in the town-owned parking lot adjacent to the marina while the marina is dredged. Approximately 60,000 total cubic yards of sandy material will be dredged from the main channel, anchorage, Sluice Creek, and marina.   A mechanical dredge using various types of clamshell buckets will remove material from the shoaled portions of the Guilford Harbor FNC and marina and then place it into scows.  The scows will then be towed to Central Disposal Area in Long Island Sound where the dredge spoils will be discharged for final disposal.  It is anticipated that all work will be completed in approximately 10 to 12 weeks and will be executed during the dredge window of October 1, 2014 to January 31, 2015. <br>  <br> Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following:  business classification (i.e. small business), type of equipment to be used, as well as qualifications and experience with performing at least 3 projects involving dredging of similar size and nature and completed within the last 5 years.  Responses are due March 11, 2014 by 5:00pm EST.  Responses should include experience of foreman and dredge operators working on mechanical dredge projects.  Proof of bonding capability is also required.  Responses are limited to twenty pages.  Responses are due March 11, 2014 by 5:00pm EST.  Responses should be emailed to Susan Dunnagan at Susan.K.Dunnagan@usace.army.mil.  Contact her at 978-318-8060 with questions.  Interested firms shall provide the above documentation in one original form and one copy.  The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided.  This is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.  The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.   <br>

<DESC>The Fighters/Bombers (F/B) Directorate within the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) are requesting Industry independent research and development (IR&amp;D) information and recommendations on technology solutions for upgrading the existing legacy radar systems within part of its bomber fleet. Specifically, the F/B Directorate is considering radar improvements to its B-1 and/or B-52 fleet and is interested in AESA radar technology. AESA radars aim their "beam" by emitting separate radio waves interfering constructively at certain angles off the antenna. With this technology change, there is a desire to preserve current system radar modes.

<SOLNBR>N6264514RXXXX
<CONTACT>Ronald Stephen Sanford, Email ronald.sanford@med.navy.mil
<DESC>Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to award sole source bridge contracts, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1): Only one responsible source or only a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of services will satisfy the needs of the agency, to:<br /><br />CasePro, Inc. (CasePro) 21738 Hardy Oak Blvd Suite 105, San Antonio, Texas 78258-4864<br /><br />Professional Performance Development Group, Inc.&nbsp;(PPDG) 5441 Babcock Road Suite 200, San Antonio,&nbsp;Texas 78240-3989<br /><br />Chesapeake Educational Services, LLC (Chesapeake)&nbsp;1934 Old Gallows Road Suite 350 Vienna, Virginia 23708-2197<br /><br />InGenesis Arora Healthcare, LLC. (InGenesis) 6609 Blanco Road San Antonio, Texas 78216-6152<br /><br />as the only responsible sources that can provide the existing Physician, Allied Health, Technologist, Technician and Assistant services in support of the Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth, VA. This action will result in four firm-fixed price contracts with an ordering period of nine (9)&nbsp;months for Physician services and an ordering period of fifteen (15) months for Allied Health, Technologist, Technician and Assistant services&nbsp;to begin 01 July 2014. The North American&nbsp;Industry Classification System (NAICS) code&nbsp;for this requirement is 622110, a Small Business Size Standard of $35.5 million.<br /><br />CasePro, PPDG, Chesapeake and InGenesis have the necessary knowledge, experience and staff to maintain services currently performed under contracts N62645-09-D-5019, N62645-09-D-5020, N62645-09-D-5021 and N62645-09-D-5022, respectively. No sources other than the incumbents can satisfy this short-term need given the transition period that would be required (e.g. lead-time required for an alternate contractor to recruit and hire a replacement staff, submit Individual Professional Files/Individual Credential Files for each&nbsp;health care worker and for the sites to complete the privileging process does not exist prior to 01 July 2014);&nbsp;conducting a follow-on acquisition for this need would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. For the reasons noted above, NMLC intends to award sole source bridge contracts to ensure that Naval Medical Center Portsmouth is able to maintain its mission without any lapse in services while the competitive process for the follow-on acquisition is completed.&nbsp;<br /><br />This Notice of Intent to Award sole source contracts is not a request for competitive proposals. No contracts will be awarded on the basis of responses received on this notice. Interested parties may identify their capability to respond to this requirement in a proposal to this office by 2:00 P.M.

<DESC>IARPA-RFI-14-05
<p>SYNOPSIS</p>
<p><br />Request for Information (RFI):  Emerging Events and Participating Entities: Knowledge Representation and Reasoning with Uncertainty and over Time</p>
<p>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) often selects its research efforts through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process. This request for information (RFI) is intended to provide information relevant to a possible future IARPA program, so that feedback from potential participants can be considered prior to the issuance of a BAA. Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this announcement to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible solicitation to ensure that every effort is made to adequately address the scientific and technical challenges described below. Responses to this request may be used to support development of, and subsequently be incorporated within, a future IARPA Program BAA and therefore must be available for unrestricted public distribution. Neither proprietary nor classified concepts or information should be included in the responses. The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND AND SCOPE<br />Trying to keep our nation secure involves, in part, trying to identify emerging and evolving events. Given the sea of information that analysts must navigate daily, identifying activities of interest is a huge challenge.  Current tools and technologies do a reasonable job of identifying facts of interest in data (e.g., person names, organizations, locations) but cannot reliably identify the events and activities that link these facts together.  Some technologies have tried to identify unnamed events in data (i.e., those that represent actions or activities that are unfolding) by identifying all the verbs in a document but relating those "events" to one another and merging "events" across documents have met with little success. Being able to identify and track events over time would provide insight into events that are unfolding and the entities that participate in them.</p>
<p>One challenge to the success of identifying events, however, is that event is not clearly defined.  Events at the highest level (e.g., a presidential inauguration) have component elements. Precursor events take place long before the major event takes place.  Planning takes place; permission is obtained; decisions are made; purchases are made; participants can come and go. Each of these activities is an event. Events can also be linked to other events. Preparatory events can be predecessors of many types of higher level events.</p>
<p>Events also happen over time; they emerge. Activities build on each other, creating a hierarchy of elements and actions.  The difficulty with event emergence is that it is characterized by uncertainty because there are rarely explicit references in data to what the end goal of the unfolding process is. Identifying and understanding time and reasoning about the emergence of events and the sequencing of activities are extremely difficult.</p>
<p>NEW APPROACH AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES NEEDED<br />This RFI seeks inputs on the feasibility of making significant progress on the challenge of tracking event emergence as reported in unstructured text.  First, it is crucially important that event be clearly defined and that the concept of emergence be specified. Secondly, tracking emerging events will require methods for identifying the events and their participants beginning at a relatively granular level and moving through stages of event emergence.  Techniques must move beyond verb-based event definition and extraction to other, richer characterizations of events and to approaches that find and link events as higher-level events emerge. For example, Communication Events may lead to Planning Events. Planning Events will specify topics or issues to be addressed. A Planning Event may result in a Purchase Event. At any stage along this emergence, it may not be known what the ultimate outcome will be; but reasoning about topics, activities, related or past events and the participating entities will be crucial to understanding emergence.<br />Automating the process of identifying and tracking emerging events and their participants must address a wide range of challenges, including: <br />&bull;	Defining the concept of event, various precursor events and event emergence<br />&bull;	Addressing event co-reference within and across documents as well as entity co-reference (e.g., person, place, equipment)<br />&bull;	Representing and reasoning over time<br />&bull;	Reasoning with uncertainty</p>
<p>This RFI invites discussion of substantive advancements in the development of technologies and architectures that support identifying emerging events, their components and their participants and that can reason about the events over time.</p>
<p>The RFI is not interested in building reference lists (e.g., nicknames, place names); in improved processing of phone numbers, dates of birth, etc.; nor in resolving database semantics across existing databases. Also not of interest are "strategic" or "society-level" events or trends that involve populations, e.g., predicting civil unrest, national rebellions, etc.</p>
<p>The responses to this RFI will be used to help in the planning of a 1-day workshop on new approaches to understanding, characterizing and capturing emerging events. An expected result of such a workshop is the identification of promising areas for investment through vehicles such as seedlings, grand challenges, and programs. It is anticipated that this workshop will be held in the Washington, D.C., Metro Area in June, 2014. A separate workshop announcement will be posted with further details.</p>
<p>PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDENTS<br />IARPA is seeking respondents to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the Government in formulating a potential program. IARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues, and comment on the expected performance, robustness, and estimated cost of the proposed approach. This announcement contains all of the information required to submit a response. No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.</p>
<p>IARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources from within and outside of the U.S.</p>
<p>Responses have the following formatting requirements: <br />A one page cover sheet that identifies the title, organization(s), respondent's technical and administrative points of contact - including names, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses of all co-authors, and clearly indicating its association with IARPA-RFI-14-05:<br />1.	A one page cover sheet that identifies the title, organization(s), respondent's technical and<br />administrative points of contact - including names, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses of all co-authors, and clearly indicating the association with RFI-14-05; <br />2.	A substantive, focused one-half page executive summary; <br />3.	A description (limited to 5 pages in minimum 12 point Times New Roman font, appropriate for single-sided, single-spaced 8.5 by 11 inch paper, with 1-inch margins) of the technical challenges and suggested approach(es); <br />4.	A list of citations (any significant claims or reports of success must be accompanied by citations, and reference material MUST be attached); <br />5.	Optionally, a single overview briefing chart graphically depicting the key ideas.</p>
<p>Submission Instructions to Respondents<br />Responses to this RFI are due no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Time on March 28, 2014. All submissions must be electronically submitted to dni-iarpa-rfi-14-05@iarpa.gov as a PDF document. Inquiries to this RFI must be submitted to dni-iarpa-rfi-14-05@iarpa.gov. Do not send questions with proprietary content. No telephonic inquiries will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>Application of Advanced Receptor Models for Evaluating the Sources of Water and Air Pollution,
 Notice of Intent for Sole Source Procurement 
Procurement Office : United States Environmental Protection Agency, Superfund Regional Operations Division (3805R) 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20004 
Response Date: February 25, 2014 at 3:00 pm est. 
Background The U.S. EPA National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) develops, applies and evaluates receptor models that are used to identify and quantify pollution sources using measurements of pollutant concentrations.  Application of two advanced receptor modeling approaches is needed for two studies, one focused on sources of water pollution in rivers and the other on traffic-related sources of air pollution.
Surface water data were collected as part of EPA's Study of Hydraulic Fracturing and Its Potential Impact on Drinking Water Resources.  The sources of pollution are being evaluated using a number of mathematical receptor models including EPA Unmix.  Unmix is a multivariate receptor modeling and analysis software module (Copyright 1998, 1999, 2001, 2003 by Ronald C. Henry).  The U.S. EPA has supported the development of Unmix under Cooperative Agreement No. CR822072 to the University of Southern California, and Purchase Order Numbers 9D-17226-NATX, 2D-6043-NATX, and 3D 6126 NATX to Ronald Henry.  A new Unmix algorithm has recently been developed under EPA Purchase Order Number EP-14-W-000017 to Ronald Henry which will provide more flexibility in the analysis since it provides feasible solutions with a numerical measure of the quality of the solution.
The U.S. EPA NERL and National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) collected air pollutant and meteorological data at multiple locations in Detroit as part of a research study investigating the impact of traffic-related sources on near-roadway air quality, human exposures and human health.  Time-resolved (e.g. 5 minute) data were collected during the study in order to quantify the impact of traffic-related emissions on air pollutant concentrations near major roadways.  Since emissions from other roadways and other sources of these pollutants can contribute to the measured levels, a data analysis methodology is needed to identify and quantify local impacts from the roadway compared to other sources.  Previously, the Non-parametric Trajectory Analysis (NTA) receptor modeling approach was developed and applied to air pollutant data from multiple locations near a major roadway in Las Vegas, NV under Purchase Order Number EP08D000560 to Dr. Ronald Henry.  The NTA model (He nry et al., 2011) uses short-time resolution data (1 to 5 min average) for pollutant concentrations and wind speed and direction to construct back-trajectories.  Using nonparametric regression, NTA is able to determine the local geographical regions that are the source of high concentrations of pollutants observed at the monitor locations (i.e., receptors).
Scope or Objective The primary goal of this contract is to apply advanced receptor modeling approaches to measurement study data collected by EPA to identify the various sources contributing to the measured levels and quantify their relative impacts.  The measurement data from both studies are unique and present challenges beyond the standard application of receptor models, thus modifications or refinements to the model codes may also be needed.
Sole Source Justification This procurement is recommended to be processed without full and open competition for the professional consulting services of Dr. Ronald Henry for applying Unmix and Nonparametric Trajectory Analysis (NTA) algorithms.  Unmix is a multivariate receptor modeling and analysis software module (Copyright 1998, 1999, 2001, 2003 by Ronald C. Henry) and the development was supported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development (ORD) and Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards under multiple contracts with Ron Henry (Cooperative Agreement No. CR822072 to the University of Southern California, and Purchase Order Numbers EP-14-W-000017, 9D-17226-NATX, 2D-6043-NATX, and 3D 6126 NATX).  NTA is used to identify air pollution sources impacting receptor sites by combing wind direction and measurement data and its development was supported ORD through EP08D000560 with Ronald Henry.  Dr. Henry developed Unmix and NTA, he also has extensive experience in  receptor modeling and NTA, and has participated in numerous published Unmix and NTA projects (see attached Vitae, and receptor modeling publication list).  Dr. Henry?s application of the Unmix and NTA algorithms would be of major benefit to the EPA in allowing for improved evaluation of air and water pollution sources.
AUTHORITY AND FAR REFERENCE The basis for this recommendation is 13.106-1(b).
Dr. Ronald Henry is located at 24017 Ingomar Street. Canoga Park, CA. 91304-6113. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620. Small business $14 million-Yes.
The EPA's determination is that there is only one responsible source capable of satisfying this requirement. There is NO SOLICITATION for this requirement. Any firm that believes it is capable of meeting these requirements will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written responses must be submitted via email to the sole point of contact, Frank Bottalico, Contracting Officer at Bottalico.Frank@epa.gov no later than 3:00 pm Washington DC local time on Tuesday, 25th February 2014. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
    (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
      (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
    (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
    (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
  (u) Unauthorized Obligations.
    (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
      (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
      (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
      (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
    (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICE/COSTS
 
 This is a basic ordering agreement for the period of one year from the date of award with four (4) one (1) year options, in accordance with FAR 16.7.    A contract is formed, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this agreement, when VA agrees to place a patient in the nursing home and the nursing home agrees to accept the patient.  Upon acceptance by the contractor of beneficiaries of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), all terms and conditions of this agreement shall apply during such time as a VA patient remains in that nursing home at the expense of VA.
 
 Upon acceptance of a VA patient by the nursing home, if and when requested by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative, the contractor shall furnish all supplies and services herein described, at the per diem rates for the levels of care specified below.  VA levels of care are defined in Section D of this agreement.  VA is obligated only to the extent authorized placements of patients are made under this agreement.
 
 B.2 RATE DETERMINATION
 
 The per diem rate is established by the current Medicaid rate for Medicaid approved nursing homes plus a fair market amount (percentage) to cover the cost of supplies, services, and equipment above that provided under Medicaid established by the local state Medicaid agency (SMA).  Rates established after the effective date of this agreement will require a modification to the agreement.  

 VA shall use Medicaid rates for room, board, and routine nursing care.
 
 For all levels of nursing care a percentage is added for routine ancillary services/supplies, such as drugs, nursing supplies, oxygen (occasional use), x-ray, laboratory, physician visits, and rental equipment.
 
 Special equipment, e.g. clinitron bed, is/are not considered routine ancillary services (and may be provided by the VA).
 
 Drug costs which comprise more than eight and one-half percent (8.5%) of the per diem rate are generally not considered routine ancillary supplies (and may be provided by the VA).
 
 Rehabilitation therapies shall be provided as a distinct level of care.  Hospice Care and Dialysis are not included in the rate.  VA or other payers shall be used for Hospice and Dialysis, as determined by the veteran with VA approval.
 
 B.3 ORAL MEDICATIONS
 
 Oral medications, which comprise more than 8.5% of the per diem rate on a monthly basis, are excluded from that rate.  High drug costs shall be determined or priced using the Average Wholesale Price (AWP) of the drugs plus a transaction fee of 3% per month.  All calculations shall be made on a monthly basis.  When a high cost drug patient is identified, VA staff must be advised promptly to establish an appropriate course of action, which shall include the provision of the medications by VA.
 
B.4 	ANCILLARY COSTS
Ancillary cost are pre-approved costs for supplies or services not identified as included in the all-inclusive rate or any other pre-authorized rate or schedule or payment for items or services provided under this agreement.  Ancillary costs such as medications, special equipment, rehabilitation therapies, shall not be added to any invoice without written permission of the VA medical center placing the veteran.  If permission is received, the nursing home must also submit the physician's order for the medication/supply, the dispensing log, the supplier and the cost charged by the supplier to the nursing home, and what the nursing home is charging the VA.

DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK
 
   B.1. This Basic Ordering Agreement shall be conducted under the procedures of FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13.5. The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well-being of VA patients.  Nursing home care shall be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psycho-social needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, X ray, and other special services for VA patients shall be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided shall include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) established in this BOA shall include the cost of medical care, drugs, laboratory, x ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically excepted.
 
   B.2. Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living, to the maximum extent possible.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
 
   B.3. Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, shall be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility shall be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and shall be obtained within 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA facility shall be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
 
   B.4. If a veteran is re-hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility shall arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the patient and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days shall be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but shall not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations.  Payment shall follow state Medicaid regulations.  The VA facility shall include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the conditions above are met.
 
   B.5. the VA facility shall approve leave days (days away from the nursing home) for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a therapeutic plan and approved by VA.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year.  Payment shall follow state Medicaid regulations.  Exceptions shall be approved by the VA facility director or designee.
 
   B.6. Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, shall be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility shall be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center shall be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
 
  
 B.7.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this BOA dies, the nursing home shall within 48 hours notify the VA office  authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects pending further guidance by VA.
 
   B.8. It is agreed that VA shall have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
 
   B.9. The nursing home shall accept referral of and shall provide all services specified in this BOA for any person determined eligible by the VA Under Secretary for Health or his/her designee, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex, or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting shall not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.
 
   B.10. It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA shall provide follow up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back to the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute for nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.
 
   B.11. All medical records concerning the veteran's care in the nursing home shall be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records shall be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records shall be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient that includes at least the following:
 
     B.11.1. Admission identification record.
 
     B.11.2. VA Form 10 1204, Referral for Community Nursing Home Care, or State-approved referral form.

If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and under the authority of FAR 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation includes the incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-72. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541990 with an SBA size standard of $14 million and this requirement is NOT being conducted as a small business set-aside.
The US EPA Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) has a requirement for radiological laboratory equipment relocation services as detailed below.
Scope: EPA is consolidating environmental radiological laboratory operations previously conducted at two separate facilities in Las Vegas, Nevada and Montgomery, Alabama to one location. The EPA has a requirement for the instruments and other laboratory equipment from the Las Vegas location to be reassembled and installed at the Montgomery location, the National Analytical Radiation Environmental Laboratory, located at 540 South Morris Avenue.
The following items are required to be assembled and installed:
1. Three Canberra Industries Gamma Analyst instrument systems;
2. Two Canberra Industries Gamma Matic sample changer systems;
3. One Oxford/Tennelec series 5 XLB proportional counter system with cart;
4. One Tennelec model LB5100 instrument system without cart;
5. Three 12-chamber Alpha Analyst systems;
EPA will move the instruments into the room where they are to be installed and will provide material handling equipment, if necessary, to move items to their final location within the rooms at the laboratory. The scope of services required includes:
1. Unpacking, assembling, and interconnecting all components;
2. Adjusting the mechanical alignment of sample changer components as required;
3. Testing all components and functions as required to verify that all components are functioning properly, and correcting any deficiencies identified. This includes verifying that the automatic sample changer will correctly position all samples in a full sample load.
All work is to be performed during the normal working hours of 8 am to 5 pm, Monday through Friday.
The Government anticipates issue of a firm-fixed-price (by line item) Purchase Order for this requirement. The exact dollar amount of any and all shipping, handling, insurance and any other fees must be included in the first-fixed price quotation.
Basis for Award: The Government will make award to the responsive, responsible firm, on a lowest-price, technically acceptable basis.
Offerors must submit a technical approach detailing how they will carry out the tasks for this requirement. This information must include methodology for disassembly, packing and shipping the equipment as well as the reassembly and installation procedures. Any licenses and certifications required for this work must also be provided with the quote.

12. Description:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-14-Q-200066 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-72.

The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336411.  The small business size standard is 1,500 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  

It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a competitive basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM).  Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.

Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit quotes in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.    

SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET HSCG38-14-Q-200066 - REQUIREMENTS FOR A LIST OF REQUIRED PARTS.

Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew.  The Government shall ensure all procurements are awarded without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  
  
Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, or a certificate of conformance and traceability to the OEM.  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  

Alternate Parts will be authorized if they are an approved alternate under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) catalog system, which improves interoperability between NATO and commercial cataloging systems.  Alternate parts must satisfy all form, fit, and function requirements of the original parts and conform to the approved configuration of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) H-65 aircraft. 

The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance (COC) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. Certificate of Conformance must be submitted in the format specified in the clause.  All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.

There are multiple OEMs associated with the parts contained within this solicitation. Offerors must be able to provide necessary certification including traceability to the manufacturer, manufacturer's COC and its own certificate of conformance to ensure parts are in airworthy condition, suitable for installation on United States Coast Guard aircraft. Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.  

The Government reserves the right to withhold any item or group of items contained in this solicitation upon award.  The Government reserves the right to make a single award, no award, or multiple awards if after considering the additional administrative costs it is in the Governments best interest to do so.  The Government shall assume, for the purpose of making multiple awards, that $500 would be the administrative cost to the Government for issuing and administering each contract awarded under this solicitation.  Individual awards shall be for the items or combinations of items that result in the lowest cost to the Government including the assumed administrative costs.  

NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.

SEE ATTACHED DOCUMENT TITLED TERMS AND CONDITIONS  HSCG38-14-Q-200066 FOR APPLICABLE CLAUSES, INSTRUCTIONS AND EVALUTION CRITERIA.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Salient Characteristics:   

A)	High Resolution Barco Monitors are used by the Radiology department and require video drivers and special high end video graphic cards be installed on the PC that runs them.
B)	Barco currently only performance tests their graphic cards and monitors on Dell PC's and their recommendation to us for our needs is the Dell Precision T5610.  Barco will not guarantee that the same specifications on another PC with similar capabilities will perform identically or work at all because they do not performance test them.
C)	We currently use Barco Coronis (MDCG 3120) and Coronis Fusion (MDCC 6230) monitors.  The Caronis MDCG 3120 monitors are Black and White legacy monitors.  Now that we have upgraded to Windows 7, the only graphic cards we can use are the MX5450 or MX7500.  Our new PC configuration needs to allow for 4 concurrent  Barco monitors to reside on one PC along with a standard PC monitor for reading mail, dictation, internet access etc.  This requires that multiple high-end video cards be installed and that the PC must be able to run the Barco video drivers and software.
D)	 We have verified that the Dell PC's are able to run our legacy monitors successfully with the MX5450 video card.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 11 of this solicitation.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Field Program Manager - Syria is a member of the DCHA/OTI Middle East Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee, and can be based anywhere in the world, but must be immediately available for frequent and possibly long-term temporary duty assignments to the Syria region.  The incumbent may be required to live in temporary quarters or in a hotel in a neighboring country for indefinite periods until the situation in Syria is stabilized.  The incumbent must be prepared for uncertainty in regards to the length of time that will be required to remain in the Syria region.</p>
<p>The Field Program Manager's principal responsibility is to support the OTI country team in the development, oversight and management of the OTI country program.</p>
<p>The OTI Syria program will support the larger objectives of the U.S. Government to promote stability and democracy in Syria by providing assistance to support the political transition. In close coordination with the State Department representatives and other USG actors and with consideration of USG priorities, OTI's rapid and targeted programs will address emerging issues and empower local partners potentially to include non-governmental organizations, civil society groups, media outlets, and local and national government offices to reduce or mitigate conflict, increase transparency and accountability, and foster positive political change.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Field Program Manager in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>

The Field Program Manager is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Field Program Manager has a strong sense of responsibility, is service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The Field Program Manager is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>

<p>&bull;	Assist in regularly communicating and sharing program information with other USAID project managers, bilateral donors, U.N. organizations, international organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Additionally, the contractor shall not employ any person who is an employee of the Defense Microelectronics Activity, either military or civilian, unless such person seeks and receives approval of DMEA Staff Counsel.<br />11. Response Time: Remedial (emergency &amp; non-emergency) maintenance services response time shall be determined based on whether the problem prevents proper operation of the UPS. For example replacement of working batteries, which are four years old, would be a non-emergency and the contractor could provide a quote to DMEA within three work days of notification by DMEA or discovery by the contractor's service technicians (during PM). Work shall be completed within the time frame listed and accepted in the contractor's quote. For emergency repairs (e.g. the UPS has failed, or can only operate in by-pass mode), the contractors service technicians must arrive at DMEA within 3 hours and be ready to conduct the repair immediately upon DMEA authorization.<br />12. Quality Control (QC), Invoices and Service Reports: Quality Control is the Contractor's responsibility. The Contractor shall establish and maintain an efficient and effective QC Program to ensure conformance to contract requirements. The QC approach shall be linked directly to requirements in Technical Exhibit 1 so that service reports, and QC verification (work was done and done correctly) can all be tied to the technical exhibit. The contractor, via the QC Program, shall verify that all work required in Technical Exhibit 1 is completed properly. Within 15 days after contract award the contractor shall provide the DMEA Contracting Officer their QC plan. The Contractor shall, within 3 working days of each preventative maintenance visit, provide a service report to the COR.

DMEA hires a professional engineering firm to conduct code compliance visits as part of an annual safety inspection. Code compliance issues shall be reviewed by the contractor's service manager and corrected promptly at no additional cost to DMEA. Code compliance shall be checked against codes in place at the time of installation. COR acceptance of the work does not relieve the contractor of the contractor's responsibility for code compliance.<br />14. Maintenance Schedule. The schedule shall be in accordance with Technical Exhibit 1. The contracting officer shall approve any changes to the maintenance schedule. All PM work must be scheduled in advance (minimum two working days) with DMEA to ensure there are no conflicts (e.g. time sensitive production/testing runs, VIP visits, etc.). PM and non-emergency repair work must be scheduled for the foundry maintenance Friday (every other Friday 0630 -1500) so as not to impact ARMS operation. During repair activities, the UPS can be placed in "maintenance by-pass" but power must not be interrupted to down stream equipment because of the maintenance. Additionally, if winds are forecast to be above 15 mph in Sacramento California the day of the PM service or other approved contract actions, the UPS shall not be placed in maintenance by-pass and the service shall be rescheduled at no cost to DMEA. <br />15. Quality Assurance (QA): Quality Assurance is a Government responsibility.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ___ Are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ___ Are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73, COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APRIL 2010) <br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>&emsp;<br />STATEMENT OF NEED: Propane for Fritz Peak Observatory<br />Revised 2/18/2014</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The Chemical Sciences Division (CSD) of NOAA/OAR/ESRL maintains for atmospheric observations a remote facility called the Fritz Peak Observatory, located near Rollinsville, CO. Scientific work is conducted on a sporadic basis, so the facility needs to be available on short notice. As such, constant maintenance, upkeep, and utilities are needed year-round. The facility is heated by, and produces hot water by, a propane-fired boiler system. Since the facility is located at an elevation of ~9000 feet above sea level a constant supply of propane is required to ensure against water pipes bursting.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE<br />The objective of CSD is to ensure an uninterrupted and adequate supply of propane to the facility.</p>
<p>SCOPE<br />The Contractor is responsible for supplying propane to the Fritz Peak Observatory, 19126 State Highway 119, Blackhawk, CO 80422 (located near Rollinsville, CO). The total amount of propane to be delivered for this requirement is between 100 and 500 gallons per month (varies seasonally; ~5,000 gallons annually). Regular deliveries will be supplemented by occasional emergency deliveries, as needed.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />The base period of performance for this requirement is 12 months, beginning March 1, 2014 and ending February 28, 2015.</p>
<p>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE<br />All deliveries are to be made to the Fritz Peak Observatory, 19126 State Highway 119, Blackhawk, CO 80422 (located near Rollinsville, CO). The point of delivery is the propane storage tank located to the rear of the main building.</p>
<p>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS<br />The propane delivered shall be of a quality commensurate with residential and commercial heating purposes, similar to specifications in the attachment. The Contractor shall check the fill status of the propane storage tank periodically (approximately twice per month) to ensure an adequate supply of propane is always on hand.</p>
<p>All propane will be delivered to the storage tank located to the rear of the main building. The tank will be filled in accordance with standard industry safety practices. The site is generally not manned, so deliveries can be made without a facility representative present. Delivery notices should be mailed to the administrative assistant point of contact shown below.</p>
<p>SAFETY AND SECURITY<br />All rules concerning safety, not smoking, and the security of the property must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>POINTS OF CONTACT<br />The Government contacts at CSD in Boulder, CO are:<br />To be provided at award.</p>
<p>INVOICING<br />The Contractor will invoice on a monthly basis in arrears for that month's propane deliveries and related surcharges and fees. The invoice must include the following items:<br />1. Name and address of the contractor, which must be the same as that on the Purchase Order;<br />2. Invoice date and invoice number;<br />3. Purchase Order number and associated line item number from the Purchase Order;<br />4. Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of supplies delivered, and date of delivery;<br />5. Evidence of delivery by way of receipt;<br />6. Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice (a defective invoice is one that does not meet all the above requirements).</p>
<p>The invoices will be sent to the following address:<br />Administrative Officer<br />NOAA/ESRL/CSD1<br />325 Broadway<br />Boulder, CO 80305</p>

Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote. 
(b) QUOTE PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS The quotation shall consist of two parts: (1) technical submission and (2) price information. 
Technical Acceptability - The technical proposal shall consist of descriptive information (including equipment drawing and complete specifications) regarding the items identified in the solicitation. This information may include product literature or other narrative describing the products to be provided. The information provided should be presented in such a manner as to enable the Government to make a thorough and complete evaluation and arrive at a sound determination as to whether or not the products proposed and described will satisfy the requirements of the Government as stated in the solicitation. <BR> <BR>Selection of a vendor for award will be based on two parts, as follows: 
(1) Technical Acceptability: The technical information submitted by each offeror will be evaluated against the specifications provided in the solicitation line item description, INSTRUCTIONS TO QUOTERS, and EVALUATION OF QUOTES and determined to either pass or fail. If the technical proposal is determined "fail", it renders the entire proposal technically unacceptable. If a technical rating of "fail" is assigned, the vendor may no longer be considered for award. The Contracting Officer will evaluate products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. 
(2) Price - The vendor's proposed prices will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness. 
The PCO will review all of the proposals. Upon completion of the above, a single award for all items will be made to the offeror whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, is considered technically acceptable, i.e. received a "pass" evaluation for Technical Acceptability and whose offer is considered to be the lowest price. (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in, writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations. <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(End of Clause)<br />ADDENDUM to FAR CLAUSE 52.212-4: the following paragraphs are added to the clause:<br />(2) FAR 52.217-7 OPTION FOR INCREASED QUANTITY - SEPARATELY PRICED LINE ITEM (MAR 1989) - VARIATION</p>
<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence, initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.</p>

<p>(a) Contractors are required to comply with federal, state and local VOC compliance laws and regulations. Among other requirements, certain Contractors may also be required to operate pursuant to a Title V permit. The need for such a permit will depend on the provisions of the applicable state's "State Implementation Plan" (SIP) and the type/quantity of the Contractor's regulated emissions, including VOCs.

<p>(11) GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any Quotation submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed.

<p>(13) COMPOSITE LABOR RATE</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the Prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:</p>
<p>(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, consumables, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); <br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br /><br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating Material Handling<br />Housekeeping Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration Security Testing<br />(8) all consumables;</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation.

This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the Contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items. These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed. <br /><br />2. The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated. Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc. The Contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document". A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator.

At contract completion the Contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness. The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all Government property took over the course of the contract. This completed report must accompany the Contractor's final invoice. Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received. A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.<br /><br />4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The Contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard. This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] <br />[ ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. <br />[ ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) [ ] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) [ ] Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN. <br />(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). <br />[ ] TIN: ________________________________. <br />[ ] TIN has been applied for. <br />[ ] TIN is not required because: <br />[ ] Offeror is a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or foreign partnership that does not have income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and does not have an office or place of business or a fiscal paying agent in the United States; <br />[ ] Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government; <br />[ ] Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government. <br />(4) Type of organization. <br />[ ] Sole proprietorship; <br />[ ] Partnership; <br />[ ] Corporate entity (not tax-exempt); <br />[ ] Corporate entity (tax-exempt); <br />[ ] Government entity (Federal, State, or local); <br />[ ] Foreign government; <br />[ ] International organization per 26 CFR 1.6049-4; <br />[ ] Other ________________________________. <br />(5) Common parent. <br />[ ] Offeror is not owned or controlled by a common parent; <br />[ ] Name and TIN of common parent: <br />Name ________________________________. <br />TIN _________________________________. <br />(m) Restricted business operations in Sudan.

The Period of Performance (POP) will be 120 months from date of award.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide a PBR approach to achieve minimum performance objectives and support progress to Site Closeout involving remedial action efforts at the JBCC, MA. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the POP in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental remediation activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Performance Work Statement. Reference the latest PWS dated 16 January 2014 and attachments posted to FEDBIZOPPS for the latest documents.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL:</strong></span> <br /><br />The 772 ESS/PKS intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) PBR contract for remedial action efforts at JBCC, MA. Source selection procedures as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto will be followed. The resultant contract is contemplated to be a stand-alone "C" contract with a FFP pricing arrangement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. <strong>This requirement is being issued as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.<br /></strong><br /><strong>Notice to Offeror(s)/Supplier(s):</strong> Funds are not presently available for this effort. No award will be made under this solicitation until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date for receipt of proposals. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs. <br /><br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the fourth quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.<br /><br />Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's rough order of magnitude (ROM) for this PBR is anticipated to be between $25,000,000 and $32,000,000. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br /><br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Ms. Linda L. Cavazos. Email correspondence shall be sent to Ms. Cavazos with a copy to the contract specialist, Mr. Thomas Steinman. <br /><br /><strong>System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements:</strong> Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by the required time, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.<br /><br /><strong>Environmental Insurance (EI):</strong> The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.<br /><br /><strong>Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI):</strong> An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirements requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at JBCC may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br /><br /><strong>Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors.</strong> The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

<DESC> <br> This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for an applied research effort.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br>  <br> SILICON CARBIDE LOW COST POWER SWITCHES (LCPS) <br>  <br> The Silicon Carbide (SiC) Low Cost Power Switches (LCPS) program is an applied research effort focused on device designs and associated high yield device fabrication processes that will ultimately provide a path to low cost commercial production of SiC power switches.  Further, this effort is focused on the virtual foundry architecture that is beginning to be adopted by design houses that are utilizing excess capacity in existing silicon foundries for most of the SiC device processing and implementing any custom processes not available at the Si foundry in their respective labs.  SiC is an emerging power semiconductor material that has electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties that allow it to far surpass the performance of conventional silicon (Si) power technology and make it the prime candidate for next-generation high-temperature high-frequency switching devices for military, as well as commercial, applications. <br>  <br> Proof-of-concept, SiC high-voltage power devices have been demonstrated to provide greater than twice the power density of Si power devices and at 3X greater efficiency.  But the cost of the SiC power devices is still too high for wide-spread penetration into commercial device applications.  This program endeavors to advance the United States' capability to provide SiC high-power density, high-temperature, and high-efficiency power semiconductor switches; to identify limitations in device design and fabrication processes that must be overcome to provide lower cost reliable SiC power devices; to work with Si foundries to take advantage of current low-cost commercial power device processing to enhance wide-spread commercialization of SiC power devices.  Technology limitations/gaps identified by this program may be the focus of more sustained development efforts in the future.  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, Research Triangle Park Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Sensors and Electron Devices Directorate (SEDD) is soliciting proposals for the SiC LCPS program under Topic 1.4.3,  quote mark Wide Band-Gap Power Devices, quote mark  of the ARL Core Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Basic and Applied Scientific Research for Fiscal Years 2012 through 2017 at W911NF-12-R-0011.   <br>  <br> Solutions are sought for the development of SiC power MOSFET semiconductor switches with single die blocking voltage and current ratings of greater than 1.2 kV and greater than 10 A, respectively, with specific on-resistances as low as 2.5 m -cm2,  and with a unit cost of less than $0.25/A.   These switches should be capable of reliable operation at a junction temperature of 200 C.   <br>  <br> Since the LCPS program goals should align well with the proposer(s) future SiC MOSFET  commercial applications, it is expected that the Recipient will include matching funds of no less than 25% in their proposal plans.  There will be no equipment purchases using federal funds associated with awards made as a result of this announcement.   <br>  <br> Funding is currently available for the award of up to two cooperative agreements related to the SiC LCPS program.  While the BAA and Topic remain open for proposal submission until, 31 March 2017, in order to be eligible for the agreement to be awarded with the available funding,  proposals must be received in accordance with the due dates and instructions provided in this announcement.  It is anticipated that up to two  quote mark cooperative agreements quote mark  (31 USC 6305) will be awarded, pursuant to 10 USC 2358 Research Projects, each with a period of performance between twelve and eighteen months.  The total amount available for the SiC LCPS program is approximately $3,000,000.00.  The principal purpose of the cooperative agreements is for the public purpose of the support and stimulation of fundamental research and not the acquisition of property or provision of services for the direct benefit or use of the Government.  The Recipient of the cooperative agreements will work collaboratively with scientists from ARL to further the SiC LCPS program.  ARL will participate in the research and use its strong in-house technical expertise to jointly plan and execute the research program with the Recipient.   ARL will evaluate the fabricated power devices to Army-specific circuit stresses and analyze the devices' electrical and physical response.  These analyses and supporting data will be shared with the Recipient and ways to augment the device design, process and or starting material to improve performance will be jointly determined.  ARL's Device Reliability Physics, Pulse Switches and Circuit teams will participate in this collaboration. <br>  <br> In order to be eligible for the cooperative agreements to be awarded with the available funding for this program, offerors are to submit proposals in accordance with the submissions instructions under BAA W911NF-12-R-0011 no later than 17 March 2014 at 11:59 PM (EST).   Proposals will be evaluated using the criteria listed in the BAA.  Any Questions concerning this announcement shall be directed to Charles Scozzie by email: charles.j.scozzie.civ@mail.mil.  This special notice expires on 17 March 2014 at 11:59 PM (EST).  <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> The full BAA is posted on Grants .gov <br>

If so, provide a copy of the letter identifying that you have an approved purchasing system.   <br>   15)	Through past experience, what would be the recommended CLIN structure based upon the requirements in the PWS?   <br>   16)	Please provide feedback on the draft PWS to determine which areas may be unclear or where more specific information may be useful. Do you have any overall recommendations for improving the PWS?   <br>   17)	Fort Carson is undergoing significant expansion of facilities and infrastructure as a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) gaining installation which makes it difficult for the installation populations and contract requirements to be predictable.  Based upon past experience with BOS services, can the contractor assist the government in indentifying benefits of a cost reimbursement contract versus a firm-fixed-price contract?   <br>   18)	Indentify any measurable ways for the contractor and Government to assure cost controls.   <br>   19)	Provide a recommendation and explanation of what type of fee might incentivize the contractor to control costs and also be the best suited for this requirement given the fiscal uncertainties and likelihood of frequent incremental funding. (i.e. fixed fee, incentive fee).   <br>   20)	Will your company submit a proposal for this requirement if illegibile?   <br>      <br>   A Draft PWS and Draft Technical Exhibits have been attached to assist with the above questions.    <br>      <br>   The Acquisition Strategy for this requirement has yet to be approved, and thus a set aside, if any, has not been finalized yet. Once a set-aside, if any, is known a notice will be posted on FBO.   <br>      <br>   The submittal in response to this RFI shall be provided on standard letter size 8-1/2 by 11 inch paper.

<a href="mailto:polina.a.poluektova@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Omaha</a>
<DESC>Description of Work  <br> Oahe Switchyard Upgrade Phase I  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District is seeking information regarding capability and availability of potential small business contractors to perform work  <br>  <br> Project Background - The Oahe powerhouse is located on the Missouri River just north of Pierre, South Dakota. Construction started in 1948 and was completed in 1962. The project has seven Francis type turbine generators with a total capacity of 786MW. This power is delivered to the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) at 115kV and at 230kV. The 115kV switchyard is joined to the 230kV switchyard through one autotransformer. Each switchyard is configured in a main and transfer breaker scheme using a Main Bus and an Auxiliary Bus. The Main Bus on both switchyards has a breaker for each transmission line, while the Aux Bus on both switchyards has a single transfer breaker with common relaying on transfer breaker 2486 and MOD's on each bay for use in bypassing a single line breaker.  <br>  <br> Project Existing Conditions - The current switchyard configuration does not offer the redundancy necessary to meet modern system demands. Loss of the Oahe 115kV bus results in a loss of the Oahe autotransformer and Oahe Generating Unit No.1, including the voltage support to the 115kV Pierre Load pocket. The Pierre Load pocket is then left served by a single power line out of the Irv Simmons switchyard. An undervoltage load shedding scheme must then be implemented to keep this connection from being tripped off line.  <br>  <br> All of the existing oil-filled circuit breakers have been replaced with new 2000A SF6 circuit breakers in 2010-2011. The Main Bus and Auxiliary Bus are both rated 2000A. All line bays are rated 1200A although their breakers are now 2000A.  <br>  <br> There is much corrosion on the post insulator supports, and the post insulators are the old cap-and-pin type no longer manufactured. The cap-and-pin design ultimately experiences failure where the insulator sections separate due to expansion of the cement in the joints between the porcelain surfaces. The Project requested that all post insulators be replaced with new modern insulators, and that replacement posts be fabricated and furnished for future replacement. The  <br> number of posts to be furnished was to be derived by the Project, but at this time, no data is available; therefore, the design assumes that 30 posts of each voltage class with an option to provide more on a cost-per-post basis.  <br>  <br> The existing disconnect switch operating platforms are supported off the ground by insulators, which is a very uncommon design and could defeat the purpose of grounding. The Project also reports that these platforms are too small to serve their purpose in a practical manner - in fact it is not possible to remain standing on a platform while moving the manual switch operator through its full range of motion.  <br>  <br> Scope of Work of Upgrade - Improvements to be made include upgrading all line bays to a double-bus double-breaker scheme in both the 115kV and 230kV switchyards by replacing the line bay MOD's with breakers; installing a second autotransformer with double-bus double-breaker sources; replacing the existing autotransformer with a larger unit; and replacing the bus tie breakers in the 230kV Main Bus with MOD's. Improvements for this contract include installing the second autotransformer and breakers for a double-bus double-breaker scheme, and upgrading the Pierre and Irv Simmons lines to double-bus double-breaker configurations as requested by WAPA to alleviate current power flow problems as soon as possible. The remaining line bays, replacement of the existing autotransformer and replacement of the sectionalizing breakers with MOD's will be performed under subsequent contracts and are not part of this work effort.  <br>  <br> The new 150MVA autotransformer will be provided as Government Furnished equipment.  <br>  <br> All interested, responsive and responsible contractors are encouraged to participate in this market research by submitting a response via e-mail to polina.a.poluektova@usace.army.mil no later than 2:00 PM CST 25 February 2014. Responses should include the company name, address, contact name and title, phone number, e-mail address, business size and classification/certification under NAICS Code 237990, CAGE Code, DUNS Number, your bonding capacity (single and aggregate) and a list of your company's three (3) most recent projects of the same type described in this notice. Recent project information should include project number with title/description, name of the government agency or non-government client for which the work was performed, the agency/client point of contact (name, phone number and e-mail address) and whether you participated as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor. This notice does not constitute a request for a formal proposal. This notice is provided as information to the market place and is an invitation for an expression of interest and brief demonstration of qualifications to perform and deliver the anticipated requirement. The Government will not pay for the provision of any information, nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information.  <br>  <br> Questions regarding this Sources Sought Notice should be directed to: Polina Poluektova, Contracting Officer/Specialist, 402-995-2091 or e-mail: polina.a.poluektova@usace.army.mil  <br>  <br> Technical POC is John Palensky, 402-995-2719, e-mail: john.a.palensky@usace.army.mil  <br>  <br>

<DESC>AMENDMENT 0001: THIS AMENDMENT IS ISSUED TO EXTEND THE CLOSING DATE FROM 11:00AM EST, WEDNESDAY,&nbsp;19 FEBRUARY 2014 TO 11:00AM EST, TUESDAY, 4 MARCH 2014.<br /><br />SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE AND REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATON (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is released pursuant to FAR 15.201(e), Exchanges with Industry. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI, including any subsequent requests for proposal (RFP) or requests for quote (RFQ).
<p>This is not a combined solicitation/synopsis announcement. This sources sought synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. The Government is issuing this sources sought announcement with the description as shown below as part of a market survey. The Government is seeking vendors that are able to provide the following:</p>
<p>Day and Zero Light Cameras</p>
<p>Statement of Objectives</p>
<p>SOO PART A - GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>A.1 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>A.1.1 The Government is interested in product information on cameras that provide a day time and zero light video recording capability.</p>
<p>A.2 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>A.2.1 The Government operates an indoor training facility. The training facility contains reconfigurable walls that are on an overhead track system. The reconfigurable walls allow the floor plans to be modified. There is a video monitoring system in the training facility that records training evolutions. The cameras utilized for recording training evolutions are mounted to fixed attachment points in the ceiling. The fixed attachment points provide connections for power inputs and video outputs. Video is routed back to the training facility control room for display on monitors and storage onto hard drives. The cameras are often moved to different locations when the floor plan is changed. The cameras utilized in the training facility provide a color daylight recording capability and a no-light (complete darkness) recording capability. The no-light recording capability does not interfere with the use of MIL-SPEC night vision devices. The camera assemblies contain two cameras which switch from a color camera to a no-light (monochrome) camera when the light sensor senses the illumination has reached a pre-determined level. The laser illuminator is turned on when the no-light camera engages to allow the no light camera to capture evolutions. When the light level increases, the system will transition back to color camera with no illuminator. The illuminator does not interfere with image intensified or unaided viewing. The cameras are analog in nature with coax output and low voltage input. The existing cameras have been in place since 2005 and the failure rate has increased to a level that affects the readiness of the facility. The Government intends to upgrade the video infrastructure in the facility to support digital and high definition technology.</p>
<p>A.3 OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>A.3.1 The Government is collecting information on camera assemblies that provide the following capabilities:<br />&bull; Day-time color camera<br />&bull; No-light monochrome camera, full frame rate (30 fps) is required over high resolution<br />&bull; Laser illuminator, or other eye-safe device, for the no-light camera. The illuminator or other device may be part of the system or operate in a stand-alone mode. Illuminators shall be a wavelength of 1064 nm or higher. Other devices shall provide a no-light recording capability without interfering with MIL SPEC night vision devices.<br />&bull; The system shall have one video output for both day/night video (can be one or two cameras) <br />&bull; Shall be high definition at least in day mode<br />&bull; LWIR (thermal) is not acceptable<br />&bull; Ethernet compatible to plug into a Cisco switch. Any conversions, i.e. USB to Ethernet, are the responsibility of the vendor.<br />&bull; Power Source - Currently use an Altronix ALTV243232600CB power source. Power supplies can be upgraded based on the manufactures camera input as long as it is available off-the shelf and is similar in design to the Altronix (multiple outputs per box). Power-over-Ethernet is acceptable as long as it meets the distance limitation as noted below.<br />&bull; Frame rate - At least 30 frames per second for full video motion</p>
<p>Additional amplifying data<br />&bull; Maintenance Concept - limited to focusing, swapping failed components, cleaning lenses<br />&bull; Longest distance from power supply to camera - Approximately 150 feet<br />&bull; Current room partitions are 3'6" x 4'2" to 9'6" x 12'6". The basement is 22' x 13' and the stairs have a distance of approximately 26' for coverage. Each camera should cover approximately 10'x10' mounted 8' above the floor; however, more than one camera may be covering a room. <br />&bull; In order to accommodate various mounting schemes, the cameras must be able to be mounted from the top or bottom. If housed in a protective enclosure, the enclosure must be able to be rotated 180o.<br />&bull; Focus - Manual focus is acceptable; automatic or software controlled focus from a central computer is preferred.<br />&bull; Day/Night Switchover - The transition point from Day Camera to Night Camera &amp; Illuminator shall be adjustable and less than 1 second<br />&bull; Operating Temperature - 40oF - 120oF for sustained period of times<br />&bull; Shock resistant to withstand an environment of diversionary devices, small arms fire, and explosive charges with a net explosive weight up to 4 oz.<br />&bull; Repairs and Returns - one week evaluation time<br />&bull; Single CAT5 run to each camera<br />&bull; Horizontal Field of View shall be at least 90 degrees<br />&bull; A separate illumination source must be controlled from an Allen-Bradley PLC. When the lights dim to a specific intensity, the AB PLC will see the input and turn on the power to the illuminator. Integration into the current system is the responsibility of this Command.<br />&bull; The camera system must interface with the following Pelco Endura components:<br />&bull; NSM5200 with H.264/MPEG-4 encoding for storage capability<br />&bull; VCD5202 Decoder capable of up to XVGA 2560 x 1600 display resolution<br />&bull; NET5402R-HD Decoder capable of up to XVGA 2560 x 1600 display resolution</p>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> This contract action was awarded as a firm fixed price (FFP), cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) hybrid.  Portions of this contract action were not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract.  As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2) for portions of this contract action.
