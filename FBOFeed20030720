<DESC>This amendment to synopsis/solicitation number USZA92-03-T-0038 answers contractor’s questions.  No changes to the SOW have been made, Closing date of 4 August remains the same.   
Q 1) Do you know you can purchase these services under the GSA schedules? We are a GSA schedules holder - contract # GSA 23F0108M and we are prequalified to provide the services for all display work under the schedules.  Would you consider purchasing from us under the GSA schedules? If so we can offer you our preferred government rates.
A 1) Yes, you may submit your proposal using your GSA schedule pricing and if you are successful, we will issue the award against the GSA contract.  

Q 2) Intended Budget. (What is your budget for this project, including audio/visual equipment?)  
A 2)  The Government's estimate will not be disclosed.  Please note, this is a commercial item acquisition and therefore alternate proposals or priced options may be submitted with your proposal for consideration.  

Q 3) Colorfast: How long do you intend to keep the booth in sunlight and weather?
A 3) In most cases we attempt to exhibit only inside.  Most exhibitions last for three days.  And while the exhibit itself is not outside, occasionally, it is near a window where sunlight filters into the exhibit.

Q 4) How many posters and display items would you display at one time, how large of a table surface do you need? 24x30 or 24x40 ECT.
A 4) With the current exhibit we have one photograph for each major subordinate element with a corresponding "word" slide.  Hopefully exhibits will take advantage of new technology negating the need for printed posters and word slides.

Q 5) Do you intend to ship cases by UPS?
A 5)  No, for exhibitions within 1000 miles we "hand-carry" in government vehicles.  Beyond that we use a surface freight company as arranged by the government.

Q 6) We would appreciate receiving the electronic graphic files in whatever format they currently exist. Low resolution files for the initial rendering purposes is fine and that way they can be e-mailed to us for immediate processing.
A 6)  We have not yet decided on the graphics to be used in the first show.  Standard military graphics can be used for submission purposes.  Because of the different formats used by different companies, we are not set up to provide separate formats to all submitters.  Photographs can be downloaded at http://www.defenselink.mil/multimedia/ or at www.soc.mil.  However, all photographs at the former sight will not represent this command.  Selection of photographs will not be a consideration in the review of submitted designs.

Q 7) The RFQ states that special consideration will be given to designs
incorporating oversized LCD or Plasma displays with computer graphics.
 
  7a) RFQ states that graphics and videos will be supplied by the receiver - will this be the video for display on the Plasma or LCD?
 A 7a) Yes

  7b) does the cost of the LCD or Plasma display go into this RFQ or will the USASOC purchase that separately?
  A 7b) The intent is for the display to be a complete package to include AV -- You may submit alternate proposals.  

  7c) The delivery date is Sept 30th -- to where?  No mention was made of shipping location or charges. My guess is that this exhibit will first be used at the AUSA show in DC. Do they want to view it at Fort Bragg prior to shipment to DC or do they want to come to the producers location to view it and then ship to DC. What shipping charges should be included?
  A7c) The delivery address will be at Fort Bragg NC 28310
 
  7d) The RFQ states that the exhibit is not to exceed 10' in height.  However, the standard height for an in-line exhibit configuration is 8'.  Can we safely produce a 10' tall exhibit for them to display at all shows?  Or should we design an exhibit which is a standard 8' tall with special elements that go up to the 10' height for special shows such as AUSA where they may have received special permission to use a taller exhibit.
  A 7d) That is the configuration of the current exhibit.  It is the standard 8' with a 2' header that can be deleted when in tight spaces.

Q 8) Will the images be provided electronically?
A 8)  If ability to load images by end user is not available, we would provide material electronically in the format specified to the company contracted to build the exhibit.

Q 9) Will the videos be ready for installation, or will they need to be edited/formatted?
A 9) Our plan is to edited/format the videos/graphics in house, if possible, to give us the flexibility of making last-minute changes.  We may not use "videos" on all displays.  Hopefully we will have the ability to use slide shows or photographs on some of the display boards with video limited to just one screen.  Too many videos playing would be counter-productive. ("Too much display is no display")

Q 10) Will the SOC provide camera-ready artwork for the directors chairs?
A 10)Yes

Q 11) Can you send to me an eps of your logo so I can incorporate that into my designs? 
A 11)   All of the logos (Crests) are available on the graphic at www.soc.mil.  High-resolution graphics will be provided after award of the contract. 

Q 12. We are a distributor for Nimlok and Nomadic portable displays-The two types of portable systems are pop-up frame systems and panel systems. Did you have a certain type of exhibit in mind?
A 12.  No, we do not have an exhibit in mind.  We are looking for designs that are professional looking and meet all the requirements of the Statement of Work.

Q 13. You reference lockable storage space for cases, display and personal items. Do you mean you want the exhibit cases to fit in this space and be lockable or are you just looking for counters with lockable storage?
A 13.  Either option would be considered.  The problem is that at most exhibitions, exhibitors do not have a room to lock valuables in either after hours or during the display.  Just need some means of secure storage for both small exhibit and personal items.

Q 14. You reference that graphics and video will be supplied by the receiver.  When you say graphics do you mean the graphics for the display? So all that we would supply is the exhibit structure with no graphics?
A 14.  If graphics are incorporated into the design, we would provide the graphics.  For example, if a unit crest were incorporated into the design, we would provide the electronic files.  If the design was hanging or back-lit photos we would provide the images.  Or, if the design incorporated slide shows or videos, we would provide those to either be loaded by the supplier, or if possible, loaded by the receiver.

Q 15. Is there a website that you can supply for additional information for our designer?
A 15.  www.soc.mil  

Q 16)  Do you want us to include a layout of the display with the quote? 
A 16)  The solicitation requires the proposals to include 
1. Depictions of both Full and Partial Exhibits as seen from the front (straight on), from one of the two front corners and from overhead. 

Q 17) If yes, are you going to provide us with some kind of pictures or artwork that we can use for the rendering?  
A 17)  We have not yet decided on the graphics to be used in the first show.  Standard military graphics can be used for submission purposes.  Because of the different formats used by different companies, we are not set up to provide separate formats to all submitters.  Photographs can be downloaded at http://www.defenselink.mil/multimedia/ or at www.soc.mil.  However, all photographs at the former sight will not represent this command.  Selection of photographs will not be a consideration in the review of submitted designs.

Q 18) I wanted to verify that we exhibit builder will be responsible to provide all computer equipment.
A 18)  Looking for a turn-key operation.  We had videos and/or still photos and exhibit.

Q 19) I wanted to verify that all video and art will be provided ready to play from your organization.
A 19) Yes it will

Q 20) How many video monitors are you requesting for the full 20' display?
A 20)  That is a matter of design.  We have no expectations for a certain number, that is up to the designer.

Q 21) The request does not mention any lighting. Do you want lighting included?
A 21)  Again, a turn-key operation.  If light is required, it needs to be included.

Q 22) Can the entire proposal be received via e-mail in PDF format?
A 22)  Yes it can as long as the proposal meets all of the requirements in the statement of work and other applicable procurement regulations.

Q 23) What is the main function of this display and where will it be used?  Will it be used for recruiting or for public awareness?
A 23)  The exhibit is used in many different venues.  Half of the time it is used to represent the command in veteran-related organizations such as the Association of the U.S. Army convention, SF Association and others.  The rest of the time it is used in-house as a backdrop for visiting dignitaries and is also used in large military demonstrations.  The exhibit is many things and we rely on targeted visuals to reach to intended audience.

Q 24) Is added weight given to companies owned by Army veterans?
A 24)  No, there are no preferences associated with veteran owned businesses.

<SUBJECT>36 -- NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER TO Electronic Design & Consulting Services, Stafford, VA.
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Electronic Design & Consulting, Stafford, VA in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source. EDC is the only vendor with the capability to meet the Government’s requirements as the required units will be critical spares for existing units and must be Exact Replacements. This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), Washington, DC.  The NRL has a requirement for the acquisition of 8-EDCS-3408A Antenna Position Controllers.  The EDCS-3408-A Antenna Position Controller is a dual-processor system.  The supervisory (COTS single board computer) provides the user interfaces (display, keyboard, mouse, network and peripherals).  Microsoft Embedded Win CE 4.1 is the operating system running on the supervisory processor.  The software is a re-hosted version of the EDCS-3402B code, written in C++.  A co-processor directly controls the antenna pedestal interface cards: i.e. synchro-to-digital converter, front/rear panel interface, and relay control cards.  The two processors communicate through a dual-port RAM card on the PC-104 bus.  The coprocessor is a Rabbit Semiconductor core.  Both processors are field programmable. EDCS equipment is currently in use by the organization.  In order to maintain compatibility and functionality, this procurement must be for Antenna Position Controllers of the same type.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST July 26, 2003, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  POC:  Mathew Ridolfi, MMS/GovWorks, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions must be faxed to Mathew Ridolfi at (703) 787-1022,.  TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.
