<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL (NSWC PC) intends to award a sole source purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to Northrop Grumman Corporation's Sperry Marine (SMI) business unit of Charlottesville, VA for Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) Command, Control, Computers, Communications, and Navigation (C4N) Mission Management System software support.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. SMI is the original developer of the MMS source code and therefore they are the only company to have access to the source code.  During the LCAC Service Life Extension Program development contract, SMI developed the LCAC C4N Mission Management System software. The NAV MMS software was developed in-house at SMI and is proprietary. SMI is the only company with extensive knowledge of the NAV MMS software and they possess a unique capability to provide software support to NSWC PC. SMI is intimately familiar ! with all the software and hardware problems that are currently in the system.  Their knowledge of the software and their underlying analysis of the software problems are essential to the success of the software support effort undertaken by NSWC PC. The NAV MMS software development effort was a 3 year 7 million dollar software development effort. Use of another vendor contractor would not be cost effective and would cause substantial duplication of cost to the Government because no other contractor has access to the proprietary source code nor does any other vendor have the knowledge to support the effort.    No other option exists that would be within the NAVSEA/NSWC PC LCAC C4N Software Support Activity budget. The anticipated award date will be on or about April 15, 2005. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  Period of performance will be 365 days from issuance of the o! rder. NAICS Code 541511.  Size Standard is $21M.  FSC 6320.

1.  GENERAL. This statement of work (SOW) describes the requirement to complete a Special Forces Junior Leader 360-degree survey to provide the United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), Psychological Applications Directorate (PAD) selected psychological support and training services to Army Special Forces (SF) leadership development programs. The 360-degree survey will be completed and coordinated with the United States Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (USAJFKSWCS), and the U.S Army Special Forces Command.  The Contractor shall complete pilot testing, modification, and preparation of a final operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey, on-site informational briefings to commanders, feedback interviews with pilot testing instrument recipients, and initiation of full implementation of a final operational version of the SF Jr. Leader 360 survey throughout USASFC.
1.1. BACKGROUND. The Psychological Applications Directorate (PAD), United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), and the USAJFKSWCS are responsible for providing a broad range of psychological support and training services to active duty and national guard SF units. These services include leadership development programs for officers in command positions throughout SF. The SF 360-degree Leadership Development program (SF LEADER 360) is the primary psychological support and training service used for the development of SF leaders in operational units. A key feature of the Junior Leader 360-degree Survey is that it was created with input from SF soldiers for use only with SF soldiers and therefore is a unique 360-degree instrument. Initial work has been conducted to develop, validate, and prepare a pilot version of an SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey. This contract will define the role of the contractor in assisting the PAD and JFKSWCS in completing the development of a final operational version of the SF Jr. Leader 360-degree survey and all supportive documentation to be used in implementing the survey within SF units.

Bragg, NC. All travel will be reimbursed at rates not to exceed those contained in Joint Travel Regulations.  The Contractor shall be responsible for making his/her own travel arrangements.  All travel will be coordinated with and approved by the COR.  
2. CONTRACT OBJECTIVE.  
SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Development: The Contractor shall assist the PAD and USAJFKSWCS by conducting the piloting and modification of SF Junior Leader 360 survey, preparation of survey utilization monographs, validation research documentation, and preparation of a final operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey feedback instruments. The goal of SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Development is to generate reliable, valid, and efficiently manageable 360-degree surveys and feedback instrumentation unique to Special Forces for use in implementing the SF LEADER 360 Program.
3.  REQUIREMENTS.
3.1. SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Development.  The Contractor shall be responsible for the piloting and modification as well as the preparation of a final operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey. The SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey is a multi-rater assessment instrument where targeted leaders rate themselves and are rated by superiors, peers and subordinates on knowledge, skills and attributes essential for success as an SF leader.  SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Development involves several phases of work to include Pilot testing, and pilot version modification resulting in completion of an operational version of the instrument, preparation of a utilization monograph, preparing supportive validation research reports, and final operational feedback instrumentation development. The SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey, while primarily targeted to Captains during their team leader time, may also be targeted to Warrant Officers and Majors during their tenure as assistant team leaders and company commanders.  Work may take place at all DoD posts and NG installations CONUS or OCONUS that serve as locations for SF units, including pilot testing of a final draft version of the SF Jr. Leader 360-degree survey with a representative sample population of active duty and National Guard SF units.  
3.2. Survey Development Timelines. This represents a close-ended contract that will end on 1 October 2005. During the duration of this contract the following major tasks will be accomplished: Completion of an operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey focusing on Team Leaders and Company Commanders, to include survey pilot testing, and pilot version modification resulting in completion of an operational version of the instrument, preparation of a utilization monograph, complete supportive validation research reports, finalize all feedback instrumentation, and complete an operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey.  The Contractor will be required to provide sufficient developers and administrative support personnel to insure delivery of the final operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey by 1 October 2005. 
4.  TASKS AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS.
4.1.  SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Development. The Contractor completes the development of an SF unique operational edition of an SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey for use in the SF LEADER 360 Implementation Program.  Contractor responsibility for the completion of development of SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey involves the following subtasks:
4.1.1	   SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey data reports development.  Item and scale information derived from the 360 instrument results must be reflected effectively in reports that facilitate the feedback process, which is the key component to any 360-degree feedback program.  The contractor is responsible for developing clear, coherent reports that make maximal use of instrument data for purposes of providing effective feedback to developing leaders.  Report content and design is developed in conjunction with the consultation to the target group, subject matter experts in the area of developmental feedback, and other subject matter experts knowledgeable in the area of 360-instrument development and execution.  The contractor is responsible for conducting meetings with critical individuals and panel groups to ensure that the end product is useful to both the target of the 360 instrument and to the professionals who will be tasked to use the reports in their respective developmental programs.  
4.1.2.  SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey pilot testing and pilot version modification and completion of initial operational version of the instrument.  Once an initial pilot version of the 360 instrument is developed, pilot testing of the instrument on a subset of potential targets is necessary to allow for final revisions of items sets, scales, and reports prior to initiating the use of the instrument in regular practice.  Pilot testing of a final draft version of the SF Jr. Leader 360-degree survey will include a representative sample population of active duty and National Guard SF units.  
The data obtained from the pilot testing provides the necessary data to improve and streamline item sets and instrument length pursuant to the development of a more efficient and effective instrument.  Pilot testing is required for any instrument prior to any formal introduction of an instrument for routine use.   
4.2.   SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Modification. Based on an analysis of the information and data gathered during the piloting process, modifications will be made to the instrument and a final operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey will be prepared along with all supportive documentation necessary to implement the use of the instrument.  The Contractor shall make modifications to The SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey to maintain currency and relevance to the tasks and requirements of leadership in the units the instrument serves.  Changes in mission profiles and doctrine occur over time and must be reflected in the content of 360 instruments.  An example is the midcourse revisions made on the SF Senior Leader 360 following the initiation of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.  Critical task behaviors demonstrated by successful leaders in operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have required a re-evaluation of the item sets and general content that needed to be reflected in a relevant, current instrument for SF leaders.  Consequently, substantial revisions of items and scales were made in the SF Senior Leader 360 instrument prior to pilot testing.  All developmental instruments require periodic review and update to maintain relevance and efficacy.  The contractor shall be required to re-evaluate the relevance of existing instrument versions periodically as directed by the Government to ensure that developmental instruments remain optimally effective.
4.3.  SF Junior leader 360-degree Survey Documentation/Reports: The Contractor shall provide both verbal and written assessments of instrument efficacy and accuracy.  Verbal assessments will be presented to the Psychological Applications Directorate, USASOC, appropriate leadership at the USAJFKSWCS, and any other command or development entity as directed by the Government representative.  The contractor shall schedule and arrange of all necessary travel, schedule the coordination of panel membership and conduct of these and other subject matter panel meetings, keep all records from all panel meetings, manage the initial data related to item and scale development and management and analysis of pilot testing related data.  The Contractor shall also be responsible for the design and development of reports and briefs to command elements and other government representatives and their respective offices. The Contractor will assist pilot testing participants in understanding their Feedback Report and gather data on participants perceptions of the pilot SF 360s. Modifications to the Feedback Report may be required based upon participant perceptions of it clarity and effectiveness.
4.4.  The contractor will provide a technical manual that describes, at a minimum, the following:
	a.  Instrument development process

Evaluation Section:  
1.     GENERAL.  The Government will award the contract to the offeror whose offer represents the best value to the Government on the basis of (1) Technical  (2) Past Performance and (3) PRICE, as explained below.
2.     Technical.  The Government will assess the technical capability of each offeror on the following areas.   The Government will NOT assess capability on a pass/fail basis, but will use its assessments of capability as a basis for comparing offerors to determine best value.
a.  Approach to completion of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey, to include a proposed timeline for completion.   
b.  Method for providing Quality Control over daily work performance and procedures for corrective action.
c.  Special Benefits.
3.  Past Performance.  Past performance is a measure of the degree to which an offeror satisfied its customers in the past and complied with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  The Government will contact some of each offeror's customers to ask whether or not they believe:  (1) that the offeror was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the offeror's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the offeror was reasonable and cooperative during performance; and (4) that the offeror was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance the Government will contact some of the references provided by the offeror and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  Federal, state and local government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic data bases.  The Government will not evaluate an offeror's organizational past performance on the basis of the personal past performance of the offeror's key personnel.  The Government may evaluate the organizational past performance of the offeror's proposed key subcontractors.
4.  Price.  The Government will evaluate the reasonableness of the price of each acceptable offer in relation to the offeror's relative capability.  Price will be evaluated on the basis of price analysis if adequate competition is obtained.
5.    Relative Importance of the Evaluation Factors.  Nonprice evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  The Government considers an offeror's Technical Capability to be more important than Past Performance or  Price.  The elements of Technical are in descending order of importance.  However, the Government will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.  The relative influence that capability and price will have on the source selection will depend on the marginal differences among the competing offerors.  See Source Selection Decision, below.
6.   Source Selection Decision.  In order to select the winning offeror, the Government will rank the offerors from best to worst.  If one offeror has both the better capability and the lower price, then that offeror will be the better value.  If one offeror has the better capability and the higher price, then the source selection authority will decide whether the difference in capability is worth the difference in price.  If the source selection authority considers the better capability to be worth the higher price, then the more capable, higher-priced offeror will be the better value.  If not, then the less capable, lower-priced offeror will be the better value.  The Source Selection Authority will continue to make paired comparisons until he or she has decided which offeror represents the best value.
