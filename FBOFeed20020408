<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contemplates awarding a cost type contract to provide culture confirmation of influenza illness and sub-typing of influenza A viruses isolated from specimens obtained from infants at multiple study sites. A multi-site cohort study will be conducted to determine the effectiveness of maternal influenza vaccination to prevent influenza in infants < 6 months old. The study will be conducted in multiple seasons because the severity of influenza epidemics varies from year-to-year. Women who will be in their 2nd or 3rd trimesters of pregnancy from November through March will be offered the current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)-recommended inactivated influenza vaccine during the fall of each year. The infants of influenza-vaccinated and unvaccinated mothers will be followed for medical and immunological outcomes until age 6 months. During the study period, providers at participating sites will obtain nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens (or similar respiratory specimens) from infants who meet the case definitions for testing eligibility in the approved study protocol, and will submit these specimens for virus isolation. The study period at the sites will allow consistency in viral isolation, testing, typing and sub-typing of influenza A virus isolates. The agency is seeking a laboratory capable of performing the procedures described to confirm influenza in study participants at all study sites and to provide consistency for viral identification for all sites. The period of performance will be a 12-month basic contract period with two (2), 12-month options which may be exercised at the Government's discretion based upon the availability of funds for that fiscal year. The solicitation will be available on or about April 25, 2002. The date specified for receipt of offers will be approximately 45 days after the solicitation issue date.  Interested parties may obtain an electronic copy of the solicitation by downloading it from www.eps.gov.  A limited number of hard copies of the solicitation will be available by submitting a written request to the attention of Chima Ume by facsimile at (770) 488-2777 or by email at CAU9@CDC.GOV.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.  Requests for the RFP must specify RFP No. 2002-N-00406. All responsible sources that meet the above requirements may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida, intends to conduct a limited competition between Bell Avon, Inc. of Picayune, MS and B/E Aerospace-SMR Technologies, Inc. of Fenwick, WV to award a firm fixed price contract to manufacture an LCAC Deep Skirt System.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has conducted a qualification program for manufacturers fabricating LCAC flexible skirt systems. These manufacturers were qualified in accordance with Government document No. 802-6336529, LANDING CRAFT, AIR CUSHION, PROJECT PECULIAR DOCUMENT, SKIRT MATERIAL CHARACTERISTICS AND REQUIREMENTS DATED 01 APRIL, 1996, Revision C and document No. 802-6336530, LANDING CRAFT, AIR CUSHION, PROJECT PECULIAR DOCUMENT, SKIRT FABRICATION PROCEDURES dated 01 April, 1996, Revision B.  To date only Bell Avon, Inc. and B/E Aerospace-SMR Technologies have been certified as capable of providing the required LCAC flexible skirt systems.  As such these are the only two firms capable of competing for this requirement.  Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. NAICS 326299

<DESC>The main objectives of this RFP are: (a) to develop a rPA vaccine, (b) to assess the safety and immunogenicity of rPA in humans; (c) to assess protection provided by rPA in appropriate animal models of the inhalation disease, when administered in accordance with a pre-exposure and a post-exposure immunization regimens; (d) to optimize dose regimens, vaccine formulation and immunization schedule demonstrated to be protective, based on the data from adequate animal models; and (e) to develop a feasibility plan to manufacture, formulate, and fill as single doses up to 25 million doses of rPA vaccine.

Recently, significant changes have occurred in both the nature and degree of the threat posed by the use of infectious agents as weapons of biological warfare. The risk of using such weapons once appeared to be restricted to international conflicts involving small numbers of industrialized nations and an increasing number of developing countries. However, with the recent deliberate exposure of postal workers, other government employees and the American public at large to anthrax spores, there is an urgent need to devise appropriate and effective measures to protect U.S. citizens from the harmful effects of Bacillus anthracis spores used as instruments of terror. Among the strategies that might be considered to protect the American public from deliberate environmental exposure to B. anthracis spores, two are based on elicitation of protective immunity with vaccines. The first involves prior immunization with minimal doses of a vaccine known to generate significant and long-term protective immunity against inhalation spore challenge (pre-exposure vaccination). The second involves immunization, soon after aerosol exposure to spores and initiation of antibiotic prophylaxis, with a vaccine known to generate protective immunity relatively quickly after only a few immunizing doses (post-exposure vaccination). The latter would enable one to immunize at the time antibiotic therapy is begun so that a significant degree of protective immunity is present when antibiotic therapy is either completed or discontinued. In view of the events that have occurred since the national tragedy of September 11th, 2001, there is sufficient justification to warrant the rapid development, testing and licensure of a vaccine for both situations, ideally a single vaccine.

Although a licensed anthrax vaccine is required for both pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure immunization, the primary purpose of this procurement is development and production of a vaccine to protect the general US population against inhalation anthrax when administered in a immunization series of not more than three doses. Initially, the vaccine will be evaluated in both genders aged 18 ? 55 years to facilitate comparison to currently licensed anthrax vaccine, but subsequent studies leading to licensure are expected to extend the range of ages in which it is indicated and develop optimal dose regimen and schedule for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Demonstration of protection in appropriate animal models of inhalation anthrax within two weeks of the completion of the primary series will serve as a surrogate measure of protective immunity in humans.

Abundant preclinical evidence is available to indicate that immunization with native protective antigen (PA) and the recombinant protective antigen (rPA) of B. anthracis adsorbed to alum generates long-lasting protective immunity against inhalation spore challenge in animal models of the disease. This immunity is mediated by antibody directed at PA, and preclinical experience in animal models provides the basis for consideration of testing rPA in human clinical trials.

The urgent nature of the current threat requires an accelerated pace of development, testing, approval and procurement of an emergency stockpile of vaccine. Although future anthrax vaccines may be formulated to include antigens other than rPA and adjuvants other than aluminum salts, these novel components are not requested because their consideration could complicate and delay approval of the vaccine sought in this solicitation.    

This solicitation is a request for proposals to develop, manufacture, characterize, and evaluate a pilot lot of B. anthracis recombinant protective antigen (rPA) vaccine and to supply the appropriate CMC information to support use of this product as an Investigations New Drug (IND) with the FDA. It is anticipated that one or more cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for Part A with incremental funding over a period of fifteen (15) months; Optional Part B, for which only candidate vaccine from Part A will be selected, will be funded for an additional twelve (12) months. The Government will select for Optional Part B the candidate vaccine that first meets the milestones and best meets the technical criteria listed in the Statement of Work. Progress will be measured against specific milestones that are listed in the Statement of Work; contract support for candidate vaccines that lag in meeting the milestones will be discontinued.  

RFP-NIH-NIAID-DMID-02-26 will be available electronically on or about April 22, 2002, and may be accessed through the Internet on the Contract Management Branch Homepage, located at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract/.

Please note that the RFP for this acquisition has been revised to include only the Work Statement, deliverable and reporting requirements, special requirements and mandatory qualification, the Technical Evaluation Criteria, and proposal preparation instructions. All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package. Following proposal submission and the initial review process, Offerors comprising the competitive range will be requested to provide additional documentation to the Contracting Officer.

Responses to this RFP will be due by 4:00 pm on Thursday, June 6, 2002. Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Government. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>Submission Proposal Place:  Direcci?n General de Aduanas; Attention: Mario Das Neves, Director General de Aduanas; Azopardo 350- 1er. Piso; C1107AAD Capital Federal; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Phone: 54 11 4338 6640; Fax: 54 11 4338 6644:       The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for the Argentine Customs Authority (Customs) to conduct an a cost benefit analysis of implement scanner technology and an assessment of financing methods, as well as an equipment survey and recommend a list of essential tools for use by customs officers for inspection of cargo and detection of contraband. 

The Government of Argentina (GOA) is acutely aware that its current system for clearing cargo at its land, sea and air ports of entry is undermining the country?s economic interests and revenue collection.  Internal reviews conducted by organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have established that by not being able to adequately identify, value, monitor and control the movement of these goods, the annual tax and tariff revenue losses in 1999 were as much as $500 million. A 1993 Argentina Customs Feasibility Study, funded by TDA, placed the annual loss at $872 million on $11 billion of imports.

With the renewed focus on customs collections as a key source of revenue, the ?scanner project? has been reinvigorated and carries strong political support. The GOA commissioned a new study in 2000 that was charged with estimating the benefits that could be gained by implementing a scanner program.  The study, conducted by Reiter & Associates (annexed in the attached TDA Background Definitional Mission Report) concluded that the deployment of scanners would result in an annual increase in collections of $400 million.  

After considering the advice offered by Reiter & Associates, Customs now favors establishing a system of approximately 20 mobile units that are stationed throughout Argentina. The objective of the TDA-funded Technical Assistance is to provide Customs with a rigorous assessment of financial risks as well as specific recommendations for the scanner implementation project and other critical ?Customs Toolkits? procurements.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $122,285 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due datefor submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.

Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.

POC CLAUDINE DALTON (816)823-2271, CONTRACTING OFFICER, PEGGY JEWETT (816)823-2266.  REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL NOTICE FOR IDIQ Contract for Construction in Greater Kansas City Metropolitan Area.  Project Number RMO22880.  NOTE:  Offerors are required to have an established office within the Kansas City Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA), PRIOR to issuance of the Request for Technical Proposals.  (The Kansas City SMSA includes Johnson and Wyandotte Counties in Kansas and Cass, Clay, Jackson, Platte and Ray Counties in Missouri).  Request for Technical Proposals (Phase I) will issue on or about 12/14/2001 with a closing date of on or about 1/23/2002.  Request for Price Proposals (Phase II) will issue on or about 5/8/2002 with a closing date on or about 5/29/2002.  Time for completion 365 calendar days.  Anticipated maximum ordering limitation per year:  $6,788,600.  Guaranteed Annual Minimum:  $200.00.  Estimated cost range per task order: $2000.00 - $2,000,000.00.  A typical task order could contain some or all of the following:  modifications to architectural components including, but not limited to: ceilings, walls, floors (including access floor systems), roofing systems, millwork, and wall covering.  Work may also include modifications and replacement of mechanical systems to include, but not be limited to: air handling units, chillers, boilers, ductwork systems and accessories, piping systems (including pumps), HVAC system controls, fire protection sprinkler systems and accessories, and plumbing equipment/accessories.  Work may also include electrical systems to include, but not be limited to: lighting systems, primary and secondary power distribution systems and transformers.  Special competencies will be required for any work involving membrane roofing, asbestos abatement, PCB removal and/or elevator work.  The Government will award up to 10 (ten) IDIQ contracts under this solicitation.  Each award will be for one year.  There will also be four additional one-year options.  The award of a firm-fixed price task order will result from Phase II of this solicitation.  It is anticipated that future projects will be awarded on a task order basis to the one contractor (of the ten awardees) who offers the lowest lump sum price.  This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Proposals will be evaluated using a Two-Phase process.  Phase I will be technical evaluations, Phase II will be pricing.  The Government intends to use the "greatest value concept" in making the selections.  The "greatest value concept" is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the greatest value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors.  Phase I, the Request for Technical Proposals (RFTP), contains Construction Contract Clauses, Labor Standards, Solicitation Provisions, Proposal Submittal Requirements and Evaluation Factors.  This RFTP will issue on or about 12/14/2001.  All requests for the RFTP must be in writing.  There will be a Pre-Proposal Conference on or about 1/9/2002.  Proposals shall be received in this office on or about 1/23/2002.  Specific date and time shall be specified in the RFTP.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed to Phase II without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected to participate in Phase II and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate Phase I submissions to establish those within a "competitive range".  A "short-list" of technically qualified contractors will be published in Fed Biz Opps on or about April 5, 2002.  Only those firms within the competitive range will be invited by the Government to provide Phase II submissions, consisting of pricing (a lump sum price) and any special requirements defined in the specifications.  Two factors will be considered:  a technical evaluation factor and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are:  (1) Construction Experience and Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualification of Key Personnel, and (3) Special Capabilities.  The price factor is not as important as the technical evaluation factors.  As proposals become more equal in technical merit, price becomes more important.  Phase II, specifications (bidding documents) will be available from the General Services Administration at no cost.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, John Nelson, at (816)823-2268. NOTE:  OFFERORS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE AN ESTABLISHED OFFICE WITHIN THE KANSAS CITY SMSA PRIOR TO ISSUANCE OF THE REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.  REQUESTS FOR SPECIFICATIONS MUST BE FAXED TO CLAUDINE DALTON AT (816)823-5942 OR (816)823-2273.  REQUESTS MUST BE ON COMPANY LETTERHEAD WITH COMPANY NAME, ADDRESS, TELEPHONE NUMBER AND FAX NUMBER.  ONE OF THE FOLLOWING MUST BE INCLUDED WITH REQUEST IN ORDER FOR REQUEST TO BE HONORED:  COMPANY DUNS NUMBER, COPY OF COMPANY BUSINESS LICENSE, OR VALID PERSONAL STATE DRIVER'S LICENSE.

<DESC>DESC: The Fleet & Industrial Supply Center Norfolk Detachment Washington, DC, intends to award a sole-source purchase order to Rabil & Bates Communication Design Company, (312 East Diamond Ave., Suite A, Gaithersburg, MD 20877) on behalf of Naval Media Center (NMC).  This order is for the development and design of an animated web version of the monthly Navy flagship publication "All Hands" magazine. This is a follow-on order for a web based publication . The original order was awarded in 1999 to Rabil & Bates. Award will be made to Rabil & Bates because media standards require the internet version of the magazine be available to readership at the same time as the printed version. The short lead time between printing and publication necessitates simultaneous print and flash version design production, which only the current designer, Rabil & Bates, could feasibly accommodate. Note: This is not a request for competitive quotes; however, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the Navy's requirement prior to Noon, April 12, 2002. Please direct questions and/or concerns to contract specialist Jeff Cornell, ph: 202 433-3098, fax: 202 433-5414, e-mail: jeff_cornell@fmso.navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>A -- Production and Acquisition of Anthrax Vaccine
<SOLNBR>NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-29
<RESPDATE>070103
<ARCHDATE>07162003
<CONTACT>Thomas Hastings, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-496-0194, Fax 301-402-0972, Email ph23k@nih.gov - Jacqueline Holden, Senior Contracting Officer, Phone 301-496-7119, Fax 301-402-0972, Email jh55b@nih.gov
<DESC>The main objectives of this RFP are: (a) to develop a plan to manufacture, formulate, and fill as single doses up to 25 x 106 doses of rPA anthrax vaccine, and (b) to negotiate the sale of up to 25 million doses to constitute a stockpile for emergency use under IND and to maintain the stockpile.  

Recently, significant changes have occurred in both the nature and degree of the threat posed by the use of infectious agents as weapons of biological warfare. The risk of using such weapons once appeared to be restricted to international conflicts involving small numbers of industrialized nations and an increasing number of developing countries. However, with the recent deliberate exposure of postal workers, other government employees and the American public at large to anthrax spores, there is an urgent need to devise appropriate and effective measures to protect U.S. citizens from the harmful effects of Bacillus anthracis spores used as instruments of terror. Among the strategies that might be considered to protect the American public from deliberate environmental exposure to B. anthracis spores, two are based on elicitation of protective immunity with vaccines.  The first involves prior immunization with minimal doses of a vaccine known to generate significant and long-term protective immunity against inhalation spore challenge (pre-exposure vaccination). The second involves immunization, soon after aerosol exposure to spores and initiation of antibiotic prophylaxis, with a vaccine known to generate protective immunity relatively quickly after only a few immunizing doses (post-exposure vaccination). The latter would enable one to immunize at the time antibiotic therapy is begun so that a significant degree of protective immunity is present when antibiotic therapy is either completed or discontinued. In view of the national tragedy of anthrax spread by mail in the Fall of  2001, there is sufficient justification to warrant the rapid development, testing and licensure of a vaccine for both situations, ideally a single vaccine.

Although a licensed anthrax vaccine is required for both pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure immunization, the primary purpose of this procurement is production and procurement of a stockpile of anthrax vaccine that would be available to protect the general US population against inhalation anthrax when administered in an immunization series of not more than three doses. Abundant preclinical evidence is available to indicate that immunization with native protective antigen (PA) and the recombinant protective antigen (rPA) of B. anthracis adsorbed to alum generates long-lasting protective immunity against inhalation spore challenge in animal models of the disease. This immunity is mediated by antibody directed at PA, and preclinical experience in animal models provides the basis for consideration of testing rPA in human clinical trials.

The urgent nature of the current threat requires an accelerated pace of procurement of an emergency stockpile of vaccine, and several rPA anthrax vaccines are under development.  

This solicitation is a request for proposals to develop a plan to manufacture rPA vaccine under cGMP conditions and to deliver to the government up to 25 million doses of rPA vaccine to constitute a stockpile of vaccine for emergency use under IND. It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded with incremental funding over a period of eighteen (18) months  

RFP-NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-29 will be available electronically on or about April 22, 2002, and may be accessed through the Internet on the Contract Management Branch Homepage, located at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract/.

Please note that the RFP for this acquisition has been revised to include only the Work Statement, deliverable and reporting requirements, special requirements and mandatory qualification, the Technical Evaluation Criteria, and proposal preparation instructions. All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package. Following proposal submission and the initial review process, Offerors comprising the competitive range will be requested to provide additional documentation to the Contracting Officer.

Responses to this RFP will be due by 4:00 pm on Tuesday, July 1, 2003. Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Government. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this admendment is to answer questions from the site-visit held 4 apr 02.  All else remains the same.

1.  Please define more precisely how the site must be left?  What to do about bull dozer tracks and torn up grass?

Answer:  1.  Site should be only left with ash left over from the burn.  Care must be taken to keep ash out of the stormwater culverts so there are no floods the next time it rains.  All trees and vegetation should be cut as closest to the ground as possible.  There shouldn't be any dozer tracks or torn up grass.  Ruts should be graded and seeded/watered.  Sodding not necessary.

2.  Wood is to be burned in ravine, this ravine has water running through it, what about fuel used to lite fire getting into water, and what about ash getting into water?

Answer:  2.  We really should be using a burn torch to get the fire going and no accelerants.  Ash in the water shouldn't be a problem.
 
3.  If fire is started with wind blowing in an OK direction, what if later it blows toward runway?

Answer:  3.  There shouldn't be a problem with the fire blowing towards the runway.  All air traffic will be shut down in advance.  More of an issue with flames towards Golf Course Rd.  That road will have to be shut down.

4.  How small must wood be burnt to in the end?  Can small piece be buried on site?

Answer:  4.  Small pieces of wood can remain and be buried on site.

5.  What is to be done with the trash and materials in the ravine now? 

Answer:  Leave all trash and materials in the ravine.

<DESC>This announcement replaces the FedBizOpps notice posted March 18, 2002 for solicitation #52ABNC200056.  The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the time frame for this project.  Mobilization/Demobilization days are in addition to the 8 to 16 days of operation within the sanctuary. Transit time to and from the sanctuary is also in addition to the 8 to 16 days of operation and the mobilization/demobilization days.  In addition, it is the contractor's responsibility to post the Notice to Mariners for these operations.  The preferred time frame for this project is August 12- September 20 however alternate proposals  will also be considered to conduct the study beginning anywhere between June 2002 and ending September 20, 2002.

*******This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Solicitation number 50ABNC200056 is issued as a request for proposals(RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-17. This procurement action is full and open. The associated North American Industrial Classification System code is 33412.  A firm is a small business for the purpose of this requirement if the size standard is 1,000 employees or less. 

The Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS) requires the charter of a submersible or Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) as well as the captain and crew necessary to monitor benthic recovery from a cable laying.  OCNMS authorized a special use permit allowing Pacific Crossing to install 2 fiber optic cables (PC-1) through 30 nm of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS).  OCNMS will be monitoring benthic recovery from the cable laying.  This scope of work (SOW) addresses an OCNMS charter for the provision of a vessel, captain and crew and a submersible or an ROV associated equipment and staff to support research as further described in this solicitation.  Contractors must bid on the complete package.  The charter is for 8 to 16 days between 12 August and 20 September 2002 for OCNMS to conduct investigations within the Sanctuary aboard a contracted vessel (>80 ft) using a contracted submersible or ROV.  The contract can be divided into two separate cruises or approximate equal duration during the contract period of 12 August through 20 September, as needed; however, OCNMS will support one mobilization/ demobilization event.  The contractor responsibilities are listed below.
Project Area: The project concentrates on 2 types of areas: the cable route and control sites.  Although primary operations are in the areas described they are not limited to these areas. The cable route of interest in OCNMS is ~30 nm.  The primary operation will be along the eastern cable between 124o40'W to 125o10'W and 48o 20'N to 48o 30'N, although some sites along the northern cable may also be surveyed.  
 The other areas to be searched for and monitored will be control sites, which have yet to be determined.  The general areas of operation along the cable and the control sites will be between 124o40'W to 125o30'W and between 48o00N to 48o30N in U.S. waters.
Scope of Work:  The cruise will be between 8 and 16 continuous days of operation in the OCNMS.  A port day can be added but it is not considered as one of the 8 to 16 continuous days.  Mobilization and demobilization days are in addition to the 8 to 16 days of operation within the sanctuary.  Vessel operations will be conducted 24 hours per day, regardless if an Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) or a submersible is selected.  ROV activities would involve 24 hour operations.   Submersible activities would be conducted during 12 hr/day (daylight) and shipboard sampling during night operations. The cruise shall be completed between August 12 and September 20, 2002.  The dates and length of the cruise will be set at the time the contract is awarded.  Loading of contractor equipment can be done at the location of the contractors choice; however, contractor shall plan for OCNMS staging (mobilizing) in Port Angeles, WA by contacting the US Coast Guard and City of Port Angeles for access to the city pier.   Demobilization can occur in either Port Angeles or Neah Bay, WA and will be set at the time the contract is awarded.

Bid packages should be based on the 8-day research cruise plus mobilization and demobilization, with a daily rate for each additional research day for up to 16 days.

Vessel : The contractor shall supply a vessel, with crew, of sufficient size/tonnage to operate 24 hours per day, for 8 to 16 days, up to 50 nm off the Washington Coast.  The minimum vessel length is 80 ft.  The vessel must have appropriate deck equipment (winches, metering device, A-frames, davits, etc.) and operators to deploy the equipment and support the operations below.  The vessel must also accommodate 6 OCNMS staff or contracted personnel with berthing, shower & head.  If the vessel can accommodate more than 6 staffing provided as a cost option.  Separate quarters shall be provided for men and women.   The vessel shall provide 3 nutritious meals and  snack during each 24 hr period.  The vessel shall be equipped with a differential global positioning system (DGPS) andf contractor proposes an ROV then vessel must have a dynamic ship positioning system or equivalent.

The vessel shall provide ~32 ft2, near the A-Frame or davit for OCNMS for handling sediment samples and gear.  A low pressure (15-30 psi) salt-water hose for use at this deck location is also required.  The vessel shall allow for ~3 ft3 of refrigerator space and ~64 ft2 of deck space for storing samples.  The contractor must also supply counter space to set up a computer inside the vessel but within 15 m of the A-frame, to run cable.

The vessel must be equipped with a winch or suitable device to launch and recover a submersible or ROV.  The vessel must be equipped with a winch & A-Frame or davit capable of deploying and retrieving up to 300 pds of oceanographic equipment, such as a sediment grab sampler, and a CTD rosette to a depth of 350m.  The CTD rosette has an auto fire module and does not require a conducting cable on the winch. The winch must be equipped with a cable counter to determine the approximate depth of instrument deployment.  Fresh water on deck shall be provided for instrument wash down.

Submersible or ROV:   The contractor shall provide an ROV or submersible, operator(s), and externally mounted camera gear capable of taking both vertical and oblique color video and still photography of high resolution as to be able to identify sediment type and benthic organisms.  At least one of the two video cameras must record onto digital, mini DV tapes, and preferably both.  Real time shipboard viewing of ROV results or internal viewing in a submersible of the video shall be provided.  The contractor will also provide appropriate lighting for both still & video photography.  The submersible shall be capable of 8-10 hr dive time/day (12 hr operations), operating in contact with or near the seafloor over potentially rugged substrate.  If a submersible is used, it shall be able to accommodate at a minimum, 1 contractor supplied operator and 1 OCNMS scientist, with viewing ports accessible to the scientist at all times during the dive.  

The ROV shall be capable of 24 hr. operations per day operating in contact with or near the seafloor over potentially rugged substrate.

Each video shall have mounted 2-4 lasers emitting parallel beams to allow quantitative analysis from video footage or equivalent.  The viewing angle of one video camera shall be vertical and a second video will be adjustable from horizontal to vertical or held at an oblique angle.  All recorded video shall be tagged with date, time, & position of the ROV or submersible as computed in an Integrated Navigation System (INS) using DGPS & an ultra short baseline (USB) or similar system to be provided by the contractor.  Geographic positions shall be in NAD83 or WGS84 coordinates.  

Film will be supplied by OCNMS upon consultation with contractor.  The 35 still  camera shall be capable of taking automated vertical shots of sufficient resolution to be able to identify sediment type & benthic organisms.  A system (e.g., mounted quadrant) for determining the area covered by the photograph shall be provided by the contractor.

The height off bottom of the vehicle shall be maintained at a constant and recorded, such that the area of field of view is known.  The speed of the vehicle shall be maintained at 0.5 to 1.0 knots in order for the benthic organisms to be identified.

A mechanism for maintaining position or course over the buried fiber optics cable must be provided (e.g., magnetometer or via tone sensor) externally mounted on the ROV or submersible to ensure the proper study area is evaluated.  The contractor must verify equipment will work prior to cruise.  Although the location of the buried cable is known (an ROV survey of the entire route has been conducted), unless the accuracy of the navigation system is sufficient, locating the cable visually by the former trench along the seafloor can be problematic.  The ROV or submersible is required to maintain its position directly over the buried cable when transects are conducted along the cable.

The ROV or submersible shall be outfitted with a contractor- supplied conductivity, temperature, depth & oxygen-sensing array that is linked to an operational data logging system.  It is preferred that this information is received as an electronic file.

The ROV or submersible must be capable of collecting benthic infauna organisms and sediment cores at depths ranging between approximately 60 to 350m.  The samples will be processed by OCNMS for grain size and benthic taxonomy, at a minimum.  The sample collection is part of this SOW (e.g. manipulator arm and sampling device on the submersible or ROV, and a contractor-supplied winch operator working with OCNMS staff during night operations), but the sample processing is not.  The three types of sample are: 1) a method of quantitatively collecting & holding 3 or 5 sediment cores of approximate 15 cm diameter, 10 cm depth or 15 cubic centimeter box cores or equivalent per dive on an ROV or submersible; 2) a method for collecting benthic infauna covering approximately 0.1m2  area to a depth of approximately 6 cm, (e.g. suction sampler, grab sampler or equivalent device); and 3) a winch & davit or A-Frame plus operator to help conduct shipboard sediment sampling.  OCNMS shall provide the sediment sampler for this latter shipboard method.  The sediment and benthic infauna samplers (1 and 2 above) are to be provided by the contractor after approval by OCNMS.

Additional Requirements:
Reports & Documentation:  Marine Operations Abstract (MOA) - The contractor shall record & maintain an MOA throughout the cruise.  The MOA is a form for recording operational milestones along with date, time, & position.  The MOA shall be logged at every significant operational event & every 30 minutes during the cruise.  OCNMS will provide the MOA forms.  All times shall be recorded in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).  Other forms required by OCNMS will be integrated into the MOA.  A copy of the completed MOA shall be provided to ONCNMS upon completion of the cruise.  The contractor shall record digitally the geographic position of the vessel throughout the cruise with positions logged every minute.  Geographic positions shall be in NAD83 or WGS84 coordinates & recorded to accuracy equivalent to the 5th decimal place using decimal degrees.  A digital track line file in ASCII format shall be provided to OCNMS at the completion of the project.

Data recording by the contractor shall include daily reports describing the dive(s) occurring during each 24 hr period.  This information should include at a minimum, the dive number, depth of the dive, latitude and longitude of dive, latitude and longitude for the beginning and end of any transects conducted, latitude and longitude of any samples collected, type of sample collected, and notes of any other types of data collected on the dive (e.g. temperature, visibility, estimated current speed).  The latitude and longitude records can be included as part of the navigation files but must include identification of the events associated with records (e.g. "sample 1 collected").  OCNMS will work with the contractor to define what should be recorded. 

Communications:  Because the scientific staff may need to communicate with other research vessels, commercial vessels, & shore based facilities, the Chief Scientist or designee shall have access to use of radio transceivers & other available communication equipment

Mechanical Breakdown:   The contractor is responsible for maintaining all contractor provided equipment & vessels in a safe operating condition during the contract performance.   If a mechanical breakdown occurs of the vessel or ROV or submersible that is >12 hrs, the vessel & ROV/submersible shall be considered to be off charter for the purposes of billing.   The contractor shall make every reasonable effort to solve any problem causing the vessel and/or ROV/submersible and/or equipment to be out of service, & bring it back into service as quickly as possible to continue contract performance.

Fuel & Water:  The contractor is responsible for providing all fuel needed to perform the contract.  Any breaks from contract work to take fuel or water will be considered time off charter, for billing purposes.

Selection:  The selection of a contractor will be on the basis of price & technical ability.   Technical ability includes past performance & ability to meet the intent of OCNMS researchers.   The technical evaluation & price evaluation are equal in importance.   The price evaluation will involve comparing the price of 8 days ROV operation to 16 days submersible operation since this provides an approximate equivalent bottom viewing time.

Coaming.................................. 206'L x 32'W x 2'H      b. The major workscope includes drydocking the vessel and cleaning and painting the hull, decks, deck fittings, coaming, interior compartments and miscellaneous modifications and repairs noted in accordance with these specifications.      c. Wherever the term 'Plant' is used in these specifications, it is understood to refer to the items of floating plant named in this section, together with their normal appurtenances, equipment and supplies.      d. The contractor shall furnish the necessary facilities for and shall bear the expense of any movement of the plant while it is in his/her possession.      e. Should the removal, or shifting of any parts of the plant or its fittings, stores, fuel, water, etc., be necessary for the carrying out of the repairs specified, the same shall be done by the contractor at his/her own expense and all such removals shall be subsequently replaced and any damage or loss resulting there from shall be made good by the contractor at his/her expense.      f. These specifications prescribe the requirements for the repair of the NY49.  The contractor's work shall comply with US Coast Guard Rules and Regulations for Subchapter I, 'Vessels' as found in the code of Federal Regulations (Title 46, CFR) and Am erican Bureau of Shipping 'Rules for Building and Classing Steel Vessels.' PLEASE NOTE: Four hours towing time distance restriction - The specifications call for the Government to deliver the barge to the contractor’s yard. The towing vessel is restricted in its speed and in the duration and extent of its sea voyages because of t he vessel’s design and by the standards to which it was equipped and outfitted. Thus, delivery beyond a four (4) hour radius (40) miles of Caven Point Terminal would be a costly and unsafe undertaking by the Government. Large costs would be incurred for th e towing vessel, crew overtime and transportation back to Caven Point. Unnecessary jeopardy of the vessel would be occasioned by a long towing voyage into waters whose sea state could rapidly change for the worse with the barge still under tow. Prior to th e award of any contract under this solicitation the successful bidder will be required to enter into a 'Master Agreement for Repair and Alteration of Vessels'. Bidders that entered into the agreement prior to this solicitation need not comply with this cla use. Detailed information including price schedule, and plans and specifications for this effort shall be provided in its entirety on the USACE Website http://nan.usace.army.mil. This is a 100% total set-a side for small business. The applicable NAICS Code is 811310 with a small business size standard of $5 million. The contract duration is fifty (50) calendar days after delivery of vessel to contractor’s yard. All responsible offerors may submit one quote t o be considered. The solicitation will be issued April 02, 2002 and quotes will be due within 15 days, COB local time on April 17, 2002. The media selected for the issuance of the synopsis/solicitation and amendments shall solely be at the discretion of th e Government; accordingly, the media utilized for this project shall be the Internet. Paper copies of this solicitation, and amendments, if any, will not be available or issued.

<DESC>The Precision Strike Systems Program Office Mission Squadron Trainer (MST) Integrated Product Team (IPT), Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin AFB, Florida, plans to contract for an upgrade to the MST/MRTS due to a change in the weapon, contractor logistic support for the repair of MST non-warranty failures, support of six operational sites to repair/support the MST/MRTS, eliminate a software discrepancy or upgrade due to obsolete parts, and provide engineering support to accomplish analyses (failure, reliability and improvements).  It is our belief that only Lockheed Martin Vought Systems, Dallas, TX can supply this support.  Lockheed Martin designed and built the MST/MRTS and is the sole owner of the technical data.  The anticipated contract type is Firm Fixed Price/Time and Material.  Interested firms should submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) within 15 days of this announcement.  Submit the SOC to Ms. Judy Bruscino, AAC/WMGK, 102 West D Avenue, Suite 300, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6807.  The SOC must include sufficient information to demonstrate the ability to use reverse engineering to perform the requirements as stated above.  Respondents to this notice will not be notified of evaluation results.  After the SOCs have been screened, the final solicitation will be issued to those prospective sources that, in the sole judgment of the purchasing activity, have the capability to successfully fill the program requirements.    
Interested sources should contact Ms. Judy Bruscino, AAC/WMGK, 102 West D Avenue, Suite 300, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6808, by phone (850) 882-8515, extension 2112, or fax (850) 882-0877 (must call to confirm receipt).  For further information on this synopsis concerning technical questions, contact Mr Felix Ortega at extension 3202.  An ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call Dr. Mario Caluda, at (850) 882-5558 or e-mail: caluda@eglin.af.mil.  See numbered note 26.*****

<DESC>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is issuing a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) SEFC for the development of the Southeast Federal Center (SEFC) in Washington, D.C.  The 44-acre site is located in the District of Columbia Near Southeast neighborhood, along the banks of the Anacostia River, within one mile of the United States Capitol. Under the enactment of the Southeast Federal Center Public-Private Development Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-407), GSA has special authority to adopt innovative, flexible approaches for working with the private sector in developing the SEFC site.  Such approaches may include leases, contracts, joint ventures, acquisitions, and/or other types of arrangements. GSA?s primary goal is to enhance the value of SEFC to the United States. Achieving this goal will require that the site be developed to its fullest potential, drawing upon the ideas, capabilities, and experience of the private sector. GSA envisions an urban mixed-use waterfront development to include office, residential, retail, and a waterfront park.  This RFQ stage is the first stage in a two-stage selection process.  The objective of this RFQ stage is to identify the most highly qualified developers to continue in the selection process.  The RFQ will be followed by the issuance of one or more Requests for Proposals ("RFP Stage") to the most highly qualified developers identified from the RFQ stage.  Comprehensive and detailed development proposals will be solicited in the RFP stage of the selection process.  At the conclusion of the final step, GSA will select the preferred developer(s) with whom to enter into agreement(s) for the lease, sale, or other agreements regarding the development of the site(s), based on criteria outlined in the RFP.  The RFQ may be downloaded from the website: http://www.gsa.gov/southeastfederal center, or from http//:www.fedbizopps.gov.  Qualified developers are invited to respond to the RFQ by July 01, 2002.  There will be no bidders? list for this procurement and no hard copies will be provided.  Direct all questions to Nydia Coleman at 202-260-4462 or fax 202-401-0076 or e-mail nydia.coleman@gsa.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education anticipates that a sole-source contract will be awarded to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to facilitate the "Evaluation of the National Assessment of Educational Progress."  To perform the evaluation as required by the "No Child Left Behind Act of 2001" [SEC. 411(f)(1)(a) and (b)], the National Center for Educational Statistics requires a prestigious, authoritative, nationally respected organization with direct access to experts in the field of large-scale educational assessment, including psychometricians and subject matter specialists, experience in convening panels, and a proven ability to produce influential and credible reports.  The organization must be known for its objectivity, and its reputation must transcend any appearance of political influence or advocacy.  

NAS is composed of individuals of exceptional ability and distinguished reputation in the front ranks of their professions.  Inherent in the work of NAS are its on-going activities in education.  It operates through the use of panels of highly respected experts from many fields and academic disciplines, all of whom are recruited pro bono.  Specifically, NAS is able to call on The Board on Testing and Assessment, a prominent entity within its organization.  Its history in using panels to examine educational research in the field of large-scale assessments reinforces NAS' ability, credibility, and uniqueness to do the proposed work.  The rigorous peer review process and vetting of reports, exclusive to NAS, provides a weight that no other organization can provide.  Accordingly, it is NAS to which Congress and the public generally turn regarding especially controversial issues where the authoritative judgment of the best scientists and experts is required.   Therefore, the National Center for Educational Statistics has identified NAS as the only organization that meets its requirements.  

Any organization that considers itself qualified to perform this procurement should submit a capability statement outlining its qualifications to Isadora Binder, Contract Specialist, by 5:00 P.M. EST on Monday, 5/27/2002.  Two hard copies of the capability statement must be submitted.

Contract vendors must also be already inspected and approved by AMC in part 135. 

II.  MISSION PROFILES AND DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS

1.  Standard Mission Definitions.

a.  Combat Equipped Jumper.  An aircraft passenger rigged with a main parachute, reserve parachute, weapon, and ALICE pack (back?pack) to parachute from an aircraft.  The planning weight for a combat equipped jumper is as follows:
Weight of average jumper = 180 lbs.
Weight of parachute with reserve = 40 lbs.
Weight of ALICE pack and weapon = 80 lbs.
Total Average Planning Weight per Combat Equipped Jumper = 300 lbs.

b.  Paradrop Equipment Bundle.  These bundles are composed of equipment packed into a canvas container.  The maximum container dimensions are 30?x 66?x 48?.  The bundle is dropped using a static line deployed parachute.  Bundles are rigged in such a manner that when placed on the balance point of the jump platform, the parachute is on the top of the bundle or on the side of the bundle facing the center of the aircraft, based on the largest dimension.  The maximum weight of the bundle is 500 lbs. 

c.  Message Pickup (MPU) Operation. The MPU sites are selected to meet or exceed all ground and air selection considerations IAW TC 31-24.  The MPU operational procedures and techniques discussed below apply when using a STOL aircraft.
	
	1) Aircrew must be able to: Locate the PZ, and be able to identify the PZ, the authentication signals on the PZ, and both far and near recognition signals.

	2) The reception committee must select an MPU that is accessible, secure, and safe.

	3) Air considerations of Terrain: General area must be relatively free of obstacles, flat or rolling terrain is preferred; however in mountainous terrain use large valleys, flat ridges, and level plateaus, avoid small pockets and valleys surrounded by obstacles such as tall trees and hilly terrain, very difficult for the pilot to locate, approach from any direction is preferred, or a minimum of 45 degrees open quadrant on approach and departure ends, MPU PZ having a single clear line of approach is acceptable provided there is a level turning radius of 2-kilometers/1 nautical mile.

	4) Obstacles:  Terrain obstacles are rising ground or hills more than 153 meters (500 feet) higher than the PZ surface, should not be closer than 6 kilometers (3NM), and must be reported; artificial obstacles 90 meters (300 feet) in height above PZ level not on the issue map within a radius 5 NM must be reported; approach and takeoff clearance is based on the decent and ascent STOL aircraft ratio, or the so-called glide and climb ratio, 1 to 11 ratio, and also is the same ratio for mask clearance on MPU operations.

	5) Size and surface area of the MPU site: MPU pickup zone is the safe area where the aircraft has descended to recovery altitude and is level, cleared to deploy the MPU retriever system, recover the MPU container from the MPU ground apparatus, and the aircraft initiates its ascent. The PZ area is the area where the ground committee places in the visual authentication marking system; the PZ minimum area in length is 92 meters (302 feet) and its minimum width is 23 meters (75 feet).  The PZ surface must be reasonably leveled, obstacle free, vegetation should not exceed 0.3 meters (1 foot).  In addition to the PZ length, mask clearance/ascent/descent ratio (1:11 for STOL aircraft) must be applied to the approach and departure ends in order to clear any obstacle surrounding the usable area.  MPU PZ shoulder safety zone is the area on both sides of the PZ's outer edge, parallel to the PZ's long axis (minimum length 92 meters) and is extended laterally an additional 24 meters (79 feet).  Its surface inside this given area must be clear of obstacles that exceed 1 meter.  The purpose of the two shoulder safety zones is to allow the pilot lateral maneuvers, free of obstacles, to prevent the retrieve anchor point from entanglement during his approach and departure of the MPU operation.  Additional ground consideration information is the surrounding area must be relatively free of obstacles to all a safe flight during approach and departure and to prevent entanglement of the retrieve hook and line.

<SUBJECT>66 -- PORTABLE TOXIC VAPOR ANALYZER AND SAPPHIRE XL AMBIENT AIR ANALYZER AND ACCESSORIES
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE.   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Thermo Environmental, Franklin, MA for the following items: Miran Sapphire XL Ambient Air analyzer; ETL certification for Sapphire; Thermomatch Spectrum Correlation software; Carrying Case/Spare Battery Kit; Field Performance Verification Kit; IAQ standard Multicalibration in Sapphire; Century Portable Toxic Vapor Analyzer (TVA); TVA Calibration kit; TVA charcoal filter adapter; TVA extension wand; spare battery for TVA; spare hydrogen tank; membrane/O-ring kit; membrane supports for sampling probe; filter cups; EV PID capsule, FIP capsule and end cap for FID capsule.    The items listed above are required for side-by-side field monitoring of volatile organic compounds and testing in the laboratory with existing Toxic Vapor Analyzer and Sapphire analyzer.   The Government purchased equipment identical to that listed above in a prior fiscal year from The Foxboro Company on a GSA schedule contract.  Since that time, The Foxboro Company's Environmental Monitoring Operation business has been acquired by Thermo Environmental Instruments Inc. and a new GSA schedule contract has not been established.   The only known source for these items is Thermo Environmental Instrument of Franklin, MA.  These instruments are sold by Thermo Environmental through a group of manufacturer representatives with designated exclusive sale territories.  Other authorized distributor networks do not exist for these products.  Therefore to obtain identical equipment to conduct the side-by-side experiments, Thermo Environmental is the only known source.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.   Organizations that believe they can provide the required instruments are encouraged to identify themselves and  give written notice to the Contracting Officer which demonstrates that they have the expertise and capabilities necessary  to meet the stated requirements.    Forward evidence of capabilities and supporting information to: Rex S. Wolfe, Jr., Reference: #02RDS3-0020-21, DHHS, PHS, CDC,  NIOSH, ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505.

<SUBJECT>R -- ADVANCED STATISTICAL CONSULTING SERVICES
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE.   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV intends to award, on a sole source basis, a  purchase order to the West Virginia University Research Corporation, WVU Department of Statistics to provide advanced mathematical statistical consultation services in support of statistical methods development and programming services for the rotational entropy project.  The authority for this sole source procurement is FAR Part 6.302-3, in that WVU Research Corporation is the only known source within close proximity to the NIOSH with the professional expertise needed.  WVU already provides services of a statistical consultant and a programmer from previous contract activities and this contract will extend and expand services already being provided under a previous contract for an additional year.  The individuals under this contract need  to meet regularly with NIOSH investigators and will use NIOSH computer services that are protected by U.S. government security requirements.  Thus, the statistician and programmer must physically reside at the NIOSH facility on a periodic basis.  They will need to work closely with NIOSH investigators and statisticians currently supporting theoretical development in the rotational entropy project and provide advanced consultative advise for problems requiring new theoretical foundations.  Therefore, the Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the WVU Research Corporation, Morgantown, WV.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.   Organizations that believe they can provide the required services are encouraged to identify themselves and  give written notice to the Contracting Officer within 10 days demonstrating that they have the expertise and capabilities necessary  to meet the stated requirements.

Information received will solely be used  for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   If no affirmative responses are received within 10 days, award will be made to WVU Research Corporation.  All information received will be considered by the Government.

<SUBJECT>A -- Rolling Circle Amplification for Genetic Diagnostics
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE ITS INVENTION OF in situ ROLLING CIRCLE AMPLIFICATION FOR GENETIC DIAGNOSTICS.


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking for one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's invention in in situ Rolling Circle Amplification (in situ RCA) for genetic diagnostics.  The invention improves in situ DNA or RNA amplification efficiency of rolling circle amplification (RCA) from 20% to more than 90%.  Therefore, the invention enables specific DNA and RNA sequence and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) detection and analysis in virtually any type of cell or tissue, superior than any other available technologies for in situ genetic diagnosis.  By using in situ RCA technology, scientists at LLNL have successfully identified cancer cells, detected DNA and RNA mutations and quantified RNA expression levels on cells and tissues directly.  The in situ RCA is simple, easy, accurate and sensitive.  It can be carried out with conventional clinic laboratory conditions and equipments without expensive equipments such as PCR or microarrays.  One copy of either DNA or RNA is sufficient for the detection.  Because the resulting amplification product is large and anchored to the target, the product remains inside the cell during the process such that cells containing the specific DNA or RNA can be readily identified and the amplification product does not diffuse to surrounding cells or solutions.  In addition, in situ RCA adds only a small amount of cost to a typical histological examination when used for a genetic diagnosis.  The cost can be further reduced by packaging the necessary components of in situ RCA into a kit.  With in situ RCA, a clinic laboratory can easily conduct genetic diagnosis for genotyping, mutation detection, gene expression and specific sequence identification.  Applications of in situ RCA include cancer diagnosis, population identification for risk assessment, disease susceptibility, or medical treatments, and other medical and veterinary diagnostics.  Part of the invention was recently published (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 98, Issue 25, 14238-14243, December 4, 2001, http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/98/25/14238).  A patent for this invention is pending.  LLNL is looking for industrial partners to commercialize one or more applications of this invention.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's in situ Rolling Circle Amplification should provide a written statement of interest and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.  Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO02-008-294.

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's in situ Rolling Circle Amplification.
