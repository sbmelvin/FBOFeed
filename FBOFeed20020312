<DESC>NA On behalf of the U. S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Sensors and Electron Devices Directorate (SEDD), the U.S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center – Research Triangle Park Division (RMAC - RTP) is issuing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the ARMY R ESEARCH PROGRAM IN DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY (ARPDT).  The purpose of the ARPDT is to fulfill the research and development goals of the Department of the Army through a collaborative research program with ARL. The Army has a need for a wide variety of displays. These needs arise due to the many different system platforms and the variety of types of information output. In general, however, these displays fall into three main classes which would all benefit from a dvanced display concepts that would allow greater information processing and display performance through novel materials and electronics.   These classes of displays are head mounted, direct view (small to very large), and true three-dimensional.  The ARL Sensors and Electron Devices Directorate is interested in receiving novel proposals that address the technical barriers associated with improving the current state of the art in luminescent materials, devices, and components used as the basis for the displ ay technology in Army systems as well as new display concepts for the next generation displays. Multiple awards are anticipated under this BAA.  ARL intends to make these awards as Cooperative Agreements under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2358.  Information regarding the use of Cooperative Agreements may be found in the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulati ons at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html/32106r.htm.  It is noted that the Cooperative Agreements (31 U.S.C. 6305) awarded will not provide for profit or fee.  Proposals are requested in the range of  $100,000 to $1,000,000 per year with a two  year effort proposed.  The second year effort will be optional.  Cost sharing is required at a minimum of 20% for each year of the proposed program. The complete BAA will be posted on the ARL web site http://www.arl.army.mil/main/ResearchOpportunities/def ault.cfm on or about 14 March 2002.  The ARPTD Program will utilize a white paper process to encourage maximum competition.  The white paper process will be defined in the BAA.  White papers are expected to be due 4 April 2002.  Based upon evaluation of th e white papers, a full proposal may be requested. Awards are anticipated to be made in July 2002.

<DESC>The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) intends to procure 30 Optical Reader/Writers and Biometrics Verification Systems for local and pilot testing purposes.These systems will enable the INS to read, write and authenticate the biometrics stored on the encoded optical stripe of the Border Crossing Card (BCC) and display the encoded data of the Permanent Resident Card (PRC).  Each prospective offeror must demonstrate its system to INS at INS Headquarters by no later than May 1, 2002.  The offeror(s) selected must be able to provide the required equipment to INS by no later than July 1, 2002.

The reader/writers and verification systems must run on existing INS platforms using Windows 95, not Universal Serial Bus Port (USB). They cannot interrupt other peripheral devices or software. The viability/efficacy of these reader/writers will ultimately be determined through INS tests conducted locally at INS Headquarters and at the other pilot test locations. The Optical Reader/ Writers and Biometrics Verification Systems must read the BCC and other INS optical stripe card stock (BCC, PRC) in under a second and be able to record data onto the optical stripe portion of the card.  They must rapidly authenticate the biometrics of the BCC and display the results, identify fraudulent biometrics of the BCC, display transactions and verifications in a user-friendly format, and store images and information obtained from scanning the BCC and candidate. 

They must indicate when the system has made the biometrics match and identify non-optical stripe documents.  The systems must be able to write onto the optical stripe to display notes and print comparison images of the biometrics, photos, signatures and prints of document and candidate in both color and black and white.  The Optical Reader/Writers and Biometrics Verification Systems shall be robust systems, which operate in several environments and under extreme use.  

The INS requires a fingerprint scanner, reader/writer and software with the ability to make biometrics verification.  Most BCCs have two CogentR minutiae encoded on the optical stripe portion of the card.  If a positive match is not accomplished on the first finger searched, the system should read the other
minutia on the card and make a comparison.  Results should be displayed on the
screen.
 
The INS will select a source or sources who offer the INS best value, price and other factors considered. The INS reserves the right to award a contract to one or more sources. 

Interested vendors capable of meeting these requirements shall formally express their interest, request copies of the formal solicitation from INS, and provide marketing information to INS regarding their respective readers/writers (not to exceed 20 pages) to the undersigned contract specialist by March 19, 2002. Interested vendors must identify whether or not they hold current Federal Supply Schedule contracts with the General Services Administration (GSA), and specify the pertinent Schedules and contract numbers under which their reader/writers may be procured. Responses to this announcement are not offers and cannot be accepted to form a binding contract.  No cost data should be submitted, except in accordance with the solicitation which is available from the contract specialist named below. 
 
Materials submitted will not be returned to the senders.  All expressions of interests, requests for copies of the solicitation, marketing information, and inquiries shall be directed to INS contract specialist, Joseph Spencer, Room 2208, Chester A. Arthur Building, Headquarters Procurement Division, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20536.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase a dilution system for applied research and testing of devices at temperatures down to 0.025K.  It is a goal of this procurement to purchase as close to a standard model dilution refrigerator insert, room temperature gas handling system, all interconnecting plumbing, thermometers, heaters and actuators necessary for dilution refrigerator cool down, check out and control, and operating instructions and manuals.  As an option, the offerers will cost an optimum 3HE/4HE mixture. The requirements are as follows:  1) Performance: The Dilution Refrigerator shall be capable of providing continuous cooling down to a minimum temperature of 25MK or less. The refrigerator shall have a cooling capability of 100 microwatts or greater at 100 MK. 2) Experiment Access: The working volume length below the mixture shall be at least 100 MM long and shall have at least 80 MM diameter working space. Although not a requirement, the ideal dilution refrigerator would feature a vacuum can with ports that allow access for SMA type connectors for 4 semi-rigid coax leads. The top flange at room temperature would then also allow similiar access for 4 SMA connectors. The semi-rigid coax would then travel through the liquid helium before entering the vacuum can. The Dilution Refrigerator should provide a maximum of 10 MM clear shot from room temperature to the bottom of the mixing chamber.  This will be used later to carry infrared signals.  This access requires optical/thermal baffles that will be inserted when the clear bore is not in use.  3) Electrical Leads: The Dilution Refrigerator will provide a minimum of 12 twisted pair low thermal conductance leads from room temperature to the bottom of the mixing chamber.  Baffles in the helium space must allow later insertion of semi-rigid coax cables.  This may be accomplished by providing slots in the baffles or having clear shots.  4) Gas Handling System: The Dilution Refrigerator gas handling system should be designed to be easy to operate manually. Pumps included with the gas handling system shall be electrically isolated from the dilution refrigerator insert.  Any oil or air traps shall be provided with suitable liquid nitrogen flasks, if required, with a hold time of at least 24 hours with a goal of 72 hours.  5) Diagnostic Thermometry: The Dilution Refrigeraor System shall include resistance thermometers at critical locations (such as the 4HE pot, still, heat exchanges, and mizer) to monitor performance.  In addition, at least one thermometer shall be provided whose range reaches room temperature to verify warm and cool down conditions.  The absolute accuracy of these theromometers is not critical, but generic calibration curves shall be included.   6) Drawings:  The contractor shall deliver machine drawings of the dilution refrigerator system with enough detail so that all experiment interfaces (mixing chamber bolt patterns, feed through ports, room temperature described above) are well defined. The drawings shall show overall layout of the refrigerator and gas handling system for the purpose of laying out the laboratory space. The drawings shall include all critical dimensions and details on mounting points on the vacuum can, 4HE pot, still, and heat exchangers.  7) Quick turn-around capability: The Dilution Refrigerator System should be designed to allow rapid thermal cycling to room temperature and back to low temperature. 8) Factory Test:  The contractor shall perform a test of the Dilution Refrigerator System at the factory to insure that all the specifications have been met.  At the Government's option, this test will be witnessed by Government personnel or a Government representative. 9) Delivery Schedule: The drawings described above shall be delivered within 6 months after receipt of order.  The contractor shall deliver the fully tested Dilution Refrigerator System to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center within 12 months of order.***OPTION 1:  3HE-4HE Mixture :  The offeror shall include the optional cost of providing an optimum 3HE-4HE mixture for the Dilution Refrigerator. Proposals to build and deliver the Goddard Dilution Refrigerator will be evaluated based on the following factors. Understanding the requirements the offeror must demonstrate in the proposal that he/she understands the requirements listed in the statement of work (SOW).  To this end, a drawing of the refrigerator showing critical interfaces such as access ports and accommodation of specified government provided test articles must be provided with the proposal.  If the refrigerator is like a similar model already produced, this model number and associated specifications must be included in the proposal.

<DESC>BBWI is pursuing patent protection on the following technology.
Bechtel BWXT of Idaho Inc., LLC (BBWI), P.O. Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-3805

INVENTION SUMMARY:  CMPO is directly incorporated into an inert polyacrylonitrile porous matrix without the use of organic solvents and in an environmentally acceptable manufacturing process.  Preferred CMPO loadings are in the twenty (20) to thirty (30) weight percent range and higher loadings have been demonstrated.  CMPO-PAN can be prepared in particle sizes ranging from <100 micron to 1 mm.  CMPO-PAN impregnated filter media has the potential for direct analysis of loaded filters thereby simplifying analytical methods by saving process steps, reducing the volume of generated waste and lowering the toxicity of the waste.   Dilute sample concentrations found in the field can be concentrated and only the filter media needs to be transported to a laboratory or field location for analysis.  Both CMPO-PAN solid extractant particles and impregnated filter media have been demonstrated to be highly effective in removing actinides (U, Pu, Am), rare earth elements and certain transition metals (Fe, Zr).
Contact Mr. Gary W. Smith.  Potential technology development and licensing opportunity with BBWI, the prime operating contractor for the Department of Energy (DOE) at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL).  BBWI is soliciting a written indication of interest from industry partners interested in entering into a license agreement for the purpose of commercializing this technology.  License terms will include an up-front licensing fee and a running royalty based on a percentage of sales.  This is not an opportunity to provide goods or services to BBWI or the DOE.  This solicitation will close to response sixty (60) days after publication.  Interested parties should send a description of their company and their plans to commercialize this technology to the following address: Gary W. Smith, Sr. Account Executive, Technology Transfer and Commercialization, BBWI, P. O. Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-3805.  E-mail is smitgw@inel.gov.  A description of the technology follows.

<DESC>This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). H2 PURIFIER - QUANTITY REQUIRED: 1 UNIT HYDROGEN PURIFIER DIFFUSION MODULAR HP200 120V FOR AIXTRON 200/4HT SILICON CARBIDE EPITAXIAL GROWTH SYSTEM AIXTRON MODEL NUMBER: 20200281 NASA/GRC intends to purchase this item from Aixtron Corp.  THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE.  Due to the physical size and complexity of the electrical and physical connections the replacement purifier must be identical to the purifier that is currently installed. Modification of the Aixtron CVD system to accept a different purifier would seriously jeopardize the safety of operation and contaminate the purity of the existing gas lines.  The physical mounting of the purifier module and control/safety circuitry connections and data format outputs must precisely conform to the existing Aixtron 200/4HT connections and data format. Aixtron manufactures purifier modules with the necessary proprietary features.  The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 97-27. The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 334516 and 500, respectively.   The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-c9.

The contractor will perform benchmark testing of the hardware/software system using GSFC-provided data originally acquired during October 2002. The contractor will provide technial reports including especially documentation of the software system. It was determined that operations of the 1973 launched IMP-8 be terminated in late 2001 as requiring greater resource expenditure than was warranted by the science value of the spacecraft as understood at that time.  Subsequent to the termination, NASA/HQ requested that IMP-8 be reactivated to provide limited data in support of Voyager and Ulysses cosmic ray investigations. However, it was essential that all IMP-related cost be minimal.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 26, 2002. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station (CSS), Panama City, Florida, intends to award a sole&#64979;source purchase order to L3 Communications, Communication Systems West, of Salt Lake City, UT for a continuation of technical support required to assist in the continued development and testing of the LPDL system. The Laser Phone and Distance Line (LPDL) is a wireless, eye-safe laser system technology demonstration of equipment designed to replace the existing Bridge-to-Bridge Phone Distance Line systems currently used during underway replenishment (UNREP).  The LPDL is an ongoing joint Navy/Private Industry technology demonstration.  LPDL hardware will show how a system of this nature can reduce UNREP manning requirements and improve personnel safety.  The demonstration hardware will also implement a high-bandwidth data link between the ships t hat will be capable of replacing Station-to-Station phone lines that must be strung between the ships during UNREP.  In-plant demonstrations of the LPDL system have already been conducted, followed by a small boat system test at CSS, during which some system deficiencies and problem areas were noted.  Contractor support is now required to conduct systems analyses and resolve problem areas noted in the initial small boat test, accomplish and document any required follow-on testing, and provide an LPDL system for a full-scale at-sea demonstration of the improved LPDL system on selected Navy ships.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The original LPDL selected for evaluation was essentially a commercial system originally developed by L3 Communications. Thus this became a joint Navy and industry project with the eye towards devel oping an improved system capable of meeting Navy requirements but still having commercial applications. Over the period of the demonstration to date numerous modifications and improvements to the basic system have been developed by L3 to meet the strenuous military operating environment. No other contractor has the in-depth knowledge of the system design required to continue development in a timely and cost-effective manner. No other known vendor could overcome the learning curve in sufficient time to recoup costs the Government has already invested. Therefore, only L3 is qualified to perform this work. NAISC is 541710.

The U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID) contemplates
issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a five (5) year (two years firm with three, one year options) freight forwarding and booking services for shipments of commodities/food donation assistance to least developed countries in accordance with Titles II and III of Public Law 480 (P.L.480). Under this award, USAID may also generate needs for cargoes consisting of either bulk grains or packaged agricultural commodities from such programs as, but not limited to, the Food for Progress Act of 1985, Section 416(b) of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, and other logistical activities as needed. USAID may also, in accordance with the transportation element of the P.L. 480 -- Titles II and III, require services under this award which provide emergency food shipments to least developed countries in the form of bulk grains and processed packaged commodities to those least developed countries beyond the regular programmed shipments being made by the World Food Program and the Private
Voluntary Agencies. USAID intends to make one (1) award from this RFP to the most responsible firm/organization whose proposal offers the greatest value to the Government. The NAIC Code for the above award is 488510. The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Internet. (By exception, USAID can provide solicitations on a 3.5" floppy disk (Microsoft 97 format), via e-mail, or in hard copy.)  

Interested parties may also request a written copy of the RFP by mailing a request for the RFP to: U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, M/OP/EER/MTP, Ronald Reagan Building, Room 7.09-064, Washington, D.C. 20523, Attn: Yvonne WIlson. All written requests must include four self-addressed mailing labels. The RFP will be mailed and available on the Agency Web Page not less than 15 days after this notice is issued. No phone requests will be accepted. No RFP will be available for pick-up. No walk-ins. Questions
must be directed to Yvonne Wilson, Contract Specialist, U.S. Agency for INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, M/OP/EER/MTP, Ronald Reagan Building, Room 7.09-064, Washington, D.C. 20523, (Phone 202-712-1163).

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for Propulsion Tools for NASA’s Advanced Engineering Environment.  The Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) engine system analysis team requires new tools to perform rocket engine performance analysis within NASA’s Advanced Engineering Environment (AEE).  Specifically, the conceptual design tools named SCORES II and LRE Designer have been identified to provide a more conceptual level rocket engine performance analysis than the existing tools Marshall uses today. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from SpaceWorks Engineering, Inc. pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Competition is impractical because: (a) SpaceWorks Engineering, Inc. is the developer of the SCORES II and LRE Designer codes and there is no other source.  These specific codes are required to support the SLI efforts and cannot be obtained from other computer codes.  (b) SpaceWorks Engineering, Inc. has substantial experience in creating the specific code wrappers needed to adapt MSFC’s existing codes to work in the Advanced Engineering Environment. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on March 28, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The Government reserves the option to extend the contract for an additional three (3) option years, each with a maximum fee of $1,250,000 per year, for a total contract performance period of four (4) years.  The NAICS for this procurement is 541330, Engineering Services - average annual income for the past three years is $4.0 million.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS NOTICE IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE FOR THIS PROJECT BY EXPLORING POTENTIAL SMALL BUSINESS FIRMS.  Small business firms who are interested must submit their qualification statement to the Commander, PACNAVFACENGCOM, Acquisition Department, Pacific Environmental Contracts Division (ACQ231:LT), 258 Makalapa Drive, Suite 100, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii  96860-3134 by 2:00 p.m. HST, on March 26, 2002.  If hand carrying Qualification Statement, please deliver to Pacific Environmental Contracts Division, Environmental Planning Branch (ACQ0231:LT), Building 223, South Avenue, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, 96860-3134.  Qualification Statements received after this date will not be considered. This contract will be used for the preparation of larger scale and more intensive National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) environmental impact documents, including Environmental Impact Statements and Complex Environmental Assessments.  The A-E must have expertise and experience in conducting multi-disciplinary technical studies in the physical and biological sciences, cultural resources, noise, traffic, air quality, socioeconomic, and infrastructure analyses.  Short-fused projects may require the A-E to concurrently prepare multiple NEPA documents in a very condensed period of time.  Related technical services may include, but are not limited to, preliminary site assessment studies, feasibility assessments and civil engineering services with associated multi-discipline A-E support as required.  Examples include preparation of technical reports including conducting engineering investigations and concept studies, or feasibility assessments to obtain sufficient site data to determine the environmental impacts of a proposed action.  A preliminary site assessment study may require additional analyses, including topographic, geotechnical, hazardous materials, and infrastructural (roads, drainage, electrical, water, sewage, etc.) aspects of proposed actions.  The term environmental impact document includes but is not limited to any Scoping Document, Record of Categorical Exclusion (RCE), Environmental Assessment (EA), Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), Notice of Intent, draft or final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), Record of Decision (ROD), general planning document or the requirements of such other governmental agencies for which PACNAVFACENGCOM may be tasked to provide environmental impact documents.  Also included under this contract scope are:  (a) any preparatory work, presentation, briefing, consultations, study, or report which may be required prior to the initiation of any environmental impact document, (b) supporting studies for RCEs, EAs, DEIS and EIS such as flora and fauna studies, land management plans/studies, cultural (historic and archaeological) studies and consultations, noise, air andwater surveys, traffic surveys, hazardous waste impact studies, socio-economic impact studies, and (c) general planning studies.  The primary tasks anticipated under this contract are the preparation, updating, and review of environmental impact documents.  Secondary tasks may include related technical services as outlined above, preparing or updating integrated natural resources management plans, flora/fauna guides/plans, soils conservation studies, historic preservation/cultural resources studies, preparing or updating integrated cultural resources management plans, repatriation studies/plans, preparing or implementing interpretive plans, and assorted environmental planning guides/brochures.  Additionally, the A-E may be assigned ancillary work involving word processing, graphics, reproduction, manuscript editing, and other services related to environmental impact documents under preparation by the A-E or by PACNAVFACENGCOM staff.  The type of environmental impact assessments/statements and studies required in the preparation of environmental impact documents will generally involve technical engineering considerations, but for some assignments, there may be no technical engineering requirements.  Project assignments may include projects for governmental agencies other than the U.S. Navy, such as the U.S. Coast Guard or the U.S. Marine Corps, for which PACNAVFACENGCOM may be tasked to provide environmental documents.  Many military areas of work anticipated under this contract will not allow the entry of aliens.  The field crew of the A-E shall be composed of U. S. citizens who can qualify for access to these areas.  The Government utilizes the following software suite:  Microsoft WINDOWS NT 4.0/5.0 WORKSTATION, Microsoft OFFICE 2000 PROFESSIONAL (WORD 2000, POWERPOINT 2000, EXCEL 2000, ACCESS 2000).  In preparation of documents and correspondence, the A-E shall ensure compatibility with the Government's software.  Interested parties are requested to submit their Qualification statement with the following information:  (1) name and address of firm; (2) size of business, size status, e.g. small, small disadvantaged, or 8(a), number of years in the business; (3) average annual revenue for the past three years, number of employees, type and quantity of in-house expertise; (4) professional qualifications of the firm and staff proposed in the field of environmental planning  for U.

S. Department of Defense in particular; (7) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time and ability to handle multiple projects at the same time.  Indicate the firm's present workload.  Submit one hard copy of Qualification Statement plus one electronic copy (3.5? diskette or CD-ROM).  Facsimile transmissions and late submissions of Qualification Statements will not be accepted.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  A forthcoming synopsis will indicate whether the project will be a restricted or unrestricted procurement action, on or about April 10, 2002.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Microarray Facility plans to procure 2 Genechip Systems with Scanner & Hybridization Oven, 3 Genechip Fludics 400, and 2 Workstations (GeneChip Inst 1.) from Affymetrix Inc., 3380 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA  95051.  The NCI Microarray Facility manufacturers quality cDNA microarrays for comprehensive gene expression analysis, provides training protocols and technical support to NCI researchers and develops new microarray technologies and applications.  The end user requires a scanner and hybridization oven that are adapted to the unique microarray chip developed by Affymetrix.  The scanner must resolve features down to 18 microns as the new chips have a reduced spot size to enable the placing of more gene sequences on the chip.  The oven is adapted to the special chip architecture to allow precise temperature control and hybridization.  The Fluidics Station 400 is essential for proper processing of the chips after hybridization.  Without the station, data from gene expression experiments would not be reliable or interpretable.  The workstation is a Pentium PC with a Windows NT 4 or 2000 operating system expandability.  This equipment will be used in conjunction with existing Government owned Affymetrix equipment that is already in the lab.  Therefore, it is essential that this equipment be procured from Affymetrix in order to maintain the comparability of the data from ongoing experiments.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to procure professional services on a sole source basis with Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden, to continue services currently being provided by the contractor under an existing purchase order.  The period of performance starts on April 1, 2002 through March 31, 2003 with three (3) one-year option periods.  The contractor will continue to provide subject indexing using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) describing the contents of each article in biomedical journals published in Scandinavian languages.  Procedures and policies are detailed in established NLM guidelines, including the NLM Indexing Manual, MeSH annotation and other NLM-generated indexing aids such as Technical Memoranda.  Indexers will access the online record for each article and review the descriptive data which have been provided for each one (pagination, language, authors, author affiliation and title).  The major effort involves the intellectual analysis of each article for subject content and the application of appropriate subject headings, publication types and qualifiers drawn from MeSH.  The immediate and continuous commitment of a professional service contractor is necessary to add new citations to MEDLINE in a timely manner, as soon as possible after the publication of the journal literature.  The Karolinska Institute has been providing indexing for this task since the 1980s.  Their indexers are trained in MEDLARS indexing policies and have many years of satisfactory performance.

<DESC>This announcement that originally appeared in the NECO on Friday, March 08, 2002, is hereby REPLACED in it’s entirely with the following announcement.  The specifications on the original synopsis remain the same.  GENERAL:  This announcement is for the re-initiation of an earlier project that was delayed due to urgent support of current hostilities. This announcement constitutes a Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) and a synopsis of an upcoming solicitation.  This CAA cancels and replaces the related solicitation SOL N00164-01-R-0135. This CAA is advisory only, alerting industry to the government’s plans to publish a Request for Commercial Offerings (RCO) solicitation, and summarizing the future RCO for industry information.  The Navy is issuing this CAA on behalf of the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Special Operation Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Program and the Fed eral Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  A solicitation will be published on or about 5 April 2002 that seeks to award Indefinite Quantities, Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contracts to vendor(s) who can provide accessory parts and assemblies for performance improvements for a family of Muzzle Brakes and Suppressors (FMBS) for small arms in 5.56mm and 7.62mm to meet the operational requirements of USSOCOM Special Operations combatants.  The SOPMOD Program is not seeking alternate sources for the current SOPMOD Quick Detach Sound Suppressor (QDSS), NSN 1005-01-437-0324, as is currently used on SOF weapons.   The SOPMOD Program is, rather, interested in pursuing a FMBS that exhibit improved capabilities to include extended life, multi-weapon application, high-endurance suppressors that show demonstrable improvements over the standard QDSS.  Descriptive statements below are considered min imum performance requirements (Threshold, or (T)).  In certain cases, higher performance objectives (Objective, or (O)) are also stated.  Sought are improvements in materials, manufacturing process, high endurance coatings, and other unknown technologies that yield extended performance suppressor life to a threshold (T) of 15,000 rounds with an objective (O) of 30,000 rounds under various firing schedules.  These improvements may be Non-Developmental Items (NDI), Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS), or NDI/COTS subsystems that can be rapidly developed into suitable items for US Special Operations and Law Enforcement.  BACKGROUND:  Special Operations Forces (SOF) operate around the world in extreme conditions including underwater, surf-zone, desert, arctic, jungle, and urban environments. They subject their weapons and equipment to extremely high usage rates and stresses. Due to the  manner in which SOF utilizes its equipment, normal military specifications are in many cases not stringent enough to support SOF use. Although the currently fielded suppressors for the M4A1 Carbines and SPR meet military performance specifications, these suppressors have exhibited CERTAIN performance characteristics that do not meet all SOF requirements when subjected to the extreme operational conditions imposed upon them by SOF operators.  Current M4QD suppressor characteristics for comparative baseline are: length-6.6inches, weight-24 ounces, diameter-1.5 inches, sound reduction-28dB, up to a 2.5 MOA zero shift when fitted to gun, with minor or no loss in instrumental accuracy, endurance to failure under harsh firing schedules approximately 10,000 rounds, and approximately 500 rounds under continuous belt-fed full automatic fire.  SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: The family of Muzzle Br ake Suppressors is planned to consist of four models (1) Close Quarters Battle Receiver (CQBR), (2) Standard Model M-4, (3) Special Purpose Receiver (SPR), and (4) Light Machinegun (LMG). The Muzzle Brake/ Suppressor shall reduce sound pressure levels by 25 decibels and decrease flash signature by 75% when mounted on the prescribed weapon system.  It shall not change point of impact more than 1.25 minutes (thresholds are 10% lessthan objectives).  The quick attach/detach type Suppressors will be suitable for precision, semi-automatic, and automatic firing. The FMBS shall be constructed of corrosion resistant materials that are abrasion, impact and battlefield chemical resistant.  All external and visible surfaces shall be coated with a dull, non-reflective coating.  The FMBSs shall be capable of being submerged in salt and fresh water to a depth of 66 feet for a minimum of 2 h ours, surfaced, drained without disassembly and reliably function in 1-minute (T), immediately (O).  The Suppressors shall not utilize replaceable “wipes” that contact the projectile and require replacement during the full capability service life of the Suppressor.  All FMBS except LMG will interface with 1/2-28 muzzle threads.  Suppressors may, but are not required to, use the current SOPMOD muzzle brake/compensator; Knight’s Armament Company (P/N 93048), except for LMG Suppressor.  If offerors do not use the SOPMOD Muzzle Brake/compensator, the offeror will provide a replacement compensator with the suppressor and must allow installation on the weapon, replacing the SOPMOD compensator before using the Suppressor. If a replacement compensator is provided, it shall be functionally equivalent and provide flash reduction and compensation performance equal to or better than the cu rrent standard M4A1 Carbine compensator. If special materials or parts are required to properly attach and radially orient proposed replacement compensators, these shall also be provided with each compensator by the vendor.  Compensator attachment, alignment, and radial orientation shall be explained in the operator's manual.  There are four distinct functional applications required for the FMBS effort, however 4 separate suppressors may or may not be necessary, depending on the capabilities of the offerings.  The suppressor requirements for each weapon system are in the linked spreadsheet, found at www.crane.navy.mil/supply/announce.  ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT – LMG Suppressor shall be supplied for 5.56mm and 7.62mm machineguns, however, this suppressor will not allow the installation of a 5.56mm Suppressor onto a 7.62mm muzzle brake/compensator fixture.  CONTRACTING NOTES:  The  contract type will be a Firm-Fixed price IDIQ.  The government will require 15 Engineering Test Units (ETUs).  The solicitation will require delivery of 15/ea complete ETUs, at no charge to the government, for each suppressor submitted for competition, along with a concise technical proposal by the closing date of the proposal.  An additional 15 suppressors will be submitted at no charge to the government if suppressors are being submitted for evaluation for more than one weapon application.  The solicitation will be evaluated on a best value basis and the Government will reserve the right to award to other than the lowest priced offeror.  The product samples must meet the specifications referred to in the attached spreadsheet in its entirety to be given further consideration for award.  The technical proposal shall address any differences between the product samples and the pr oduction units.  The Government will not return product samples.  The minimum quantity for each subsequently awarded contract is 6/ea FMBSs (First Articles) with a maximum quantity of 10,000/ea for the M4 Carbine and CQBR FMBS variant and a maximum quantity of 8,000/ea for the SPR variant FMBS, all of which may be ordered over the five-year life of the contract.  The following items will be separate line items with 0 minimums: muzzle brakes/compensators (6,000/ea max for M4/CQBR and 4,000/ea SPR); essential installation materials (6,000/ea max for M4/CQBR and 4,000/ea SPR) and a Provisioning Item Ordering (PIO) clause of $1,000,000.  The contract is F.O.B. Destination.  For the minimum quantity of FMBSs, delivery of the 6/ea is required 90 days after the effective date of the contract (DAC).  Any subsequent delivery orders will order between 1/ea and 1000/ea with a maximum mont hly delivery rate of 300/ea.  Delivery of the other line items will be required to commence 60 days after order.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS ADVISORY ONLY.  THIS REQUIREMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN PUBLISHED PREVIOUSLY FOR INDUSTRY COMMENT.  DO NOT RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, PLEASE WAIT TO FORMALLY RESPOND TO THE RFP SOLICITATION WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED. The government does not intend to award solely on the basis of this CAA. Nothing in this announcement constitutes an obligation on the part of the government. The government will not pay for submissions resulting from this announcement.

<DESC>Modification 1

***This modification is to change the required proof of bonding amount from $3,000,000.00 to $1,000,000.00***


The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division is seeking interest from 8(a) firms only in the districts listed as South Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana.  The Navy is targeting the issuance of approximately fifteen (15) Basic Ordering Agreement's, (BOA's) in each district. The estimated time  of performance will be one (1) year and have four 4 twelve months options. BOA's are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) District Offices.
  The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division (NAVY) and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.
  The contractor will receive contract clauses, provisions,
  certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the 
  extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of
  each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order. On a semi-annual basis, the Navy and the Small Business Administration Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of (a) a usefulness and need for service and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.
  When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for
  accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans
  and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only,
  to the contractors for submission of a proposal. If the parties
  are able to come to an agreement, a contractual order will
  be issued and the Contractor will be required to furnish the
  necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision
  and overhead required to perform the work within the specified
  time allotted in the order, as directed by the Contracting
  Officer. The BOA Task Orders shall be restricted to the BOA
  holders in the SBA Districts noted in this synopsis. However,
  the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition if unable to obtain adequate competition. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement but there is a threshold minimum of not less than $100,000.00 that can be placed on a Task Order with
  a maximum of $3,000,000. A project could be awarded at an amount
  less than $100,000.00 if all parties are in agreement. The
  Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, will
  consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order. There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only. DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The anticipated work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks. Covered work includes, but is not limited to, the following types. EMERGENCY REPAIRS: Broken and leaking water lines, gas lines, sewers, storm drains, electric power lines, phone lines, associated structures, interior building repairs, broken doors and windows, etc., exterior repairs, roof leaks, related repairs caused by wind damage, flooding, etc., mechanical problems, HVAC and others. MINOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS: Miscellaneous exterior and interior renovations, fence, shelters, ramps, sidewalks, concrete work, installation or replacement of utilities, pipelines, and conduits, installation of miscellaneous electrical and mechanical devices, roof repairs, demolition projects, asphalt, painting, exterior and interior, ceiling repairs or modifications. DESIGN: On - site design solutions for emergency calls and Design/Build Services for minor construction items.
  The SIC/NAICS Codes covered under the BOA for work performed
  in the NAICS Groups 233, 234, and 235 for construction. GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers military installations within the SBA District of South Carolina, Georgia and Louisiana. The Agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. If a firm is graduating from the 8(a)program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the Contractor and the agreement will terminate. Termination of the agreement under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued. Either party may cancel the agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued task orders prior to the effective date of cancellation. The contractor may be required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Navy approval as well as a price proposal. SOLICITATIONS: Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror.
  The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed
  cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and
  profit at any time. ORDERS: Individual projects will be awarded
  using the DD Form 1155 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract.
  SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS:
  (1) Provide 8(a) Certification and applicable district locations.
  (2) Registered in the Department of Defense Central
  Contractor Registration (CCR) database; contractors may visit
  the CCR website at http://www.ccr2000.com/ for information
  on registering and checking the CCR; (3) Licensed/Bonded and
  fully capable to perform construction work under the NAICS
  Code Series 233, 234, and 235 to be identified with each potential task order requirement. (4) Provide resumes indicating the qualifications of key personnel of the Design-Build Team to
  include principals (design and construction), project manager
  (design and construction), registered professionals for each
  design discipline (architect, civil engineer, structural engineer, mechanical engineer, electrical engineer, and fire protection engineer), and sustainable design consultant; (5) Provide up to three references of completed projects within the last three years that reflects your firm's performance and qualifications similar in size and general scope and the possible complexity to the requirements listed herein. (6) Provide a narrative that describes the Design-Build Teams internal communication system used to ensure a successful project. (7) Provide proof of Bonding Capacity for a new project of approximately $1,000,000. The revised deadline for submitting the above criteria is 05 APRIL 2002  @ 1600 HOURS (4:00 PM EDT). Those contractors who respond by this revised date with complete and accurate packages will be evaluated for potential issuance of an Agreement. Technical proposals previously submitted under this proposal need not re-submit.  All submittal requirements described above must be addressed for consideration.  Submit completed packages to:  Commander, Southern Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, 2155 Eagle Drive, PO Box 190010, North Charleston, SC 29419-9010, ATTN:  ACQ12 (Robin Rourk)

Fort Lesley J. McNair, DC, Electric Utility Distribution System Description and Requirements

Current Service Arrangements.  Fort McNair, DC currently purchases electricity from Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO) under a retail customer rate. The Fort McNair Main substation consists of a sheltered-aisle metalclad switchgear assembly which is supplied from two PEPCO 13.8 kV underground feeders (Feeder #14639 and Feeder #14642) at 4 th and P Streets. A second service supplied separately by PEPCO feeders (Feeder #14637 and Feeder #14639) and switchgear near 2nd and T Streets which serves only Marshall Hall (Bldg #62). This Contract does not include the procurement of electricity and shall not affect the current electricity contract with PEPCO.

Electrical Distribution System.   The switchgear assembly consists of three primary circuit breakers (two feeder breakers and one tie breaker) and related metering and relaying equipment. The Main substation provides control and over-current protection for the two 13.8 kV underground feeders. The main post feeders terminate in a Government-owned, medium voltage set of switchgear located in a metal enclosure adjacent to P Street. This switchgear consists of two 13.8 kV, 1200 amp, 500 MVA, main air circuit breakers with a 1200A bus, protective relaying and a 1200 amp tie breaker. There are two outgoing feeders designated No.1 (East) and No. 2 (West) Post feeders. These feeders are installed entirely underground in duct banks and manholes. This system was installed in 1966 with some cable rerouting and transfer of loads over the ensuing years. Both the East and West Post feeders are 15 kV, 1/0, shielded copper with an ampacity of 195 amps (4.4 MVA). The majority of the 15 kV primary cables are lead sheathed due to the abundance of water in manholes. An order-of-magnitude inventory report (Inventory Report), containing estimated linear feet and other information for the electrical distribution system and is shown in the following tables. The sources of the information contained in these tables include electric distribution system maps, real property records and discussions with utility system supervisors. This Inventory Report is provided to assist the Contractor, however the Government assumes no responsibility for any conclusions or interpretations made by the Contractor based on the information made available by the Government.
A number of areas of the electric distribution system may require replacements, improvements or upgrades to conform to commonly accepted industry standards and practices such as the National Electric Safety Code (NESC). In addition to these potential improvements are improvements that are required of an underground electric distribution system that has an average age of over 20-years on its components.

Fort Lesley J. McNair, DC Potable Water Utility Distribution System Description and Requirements

Current Service Arrangements.  The Fort McNair potable water distribution system consists exclusively of a water line distribution system containing water main lines, fire hydrants, check valves, and currently no water treatment facilities exist. Fort McNair is supplied with potable water by the District of Columbia, Department of Environmental Services. The potable water distribution system is owned and maintained by Fort McNair. There are three points of connection to the District of Columbia system on the perimeter of the Installation; one at the main gate at P Street, one at V Street and 2nd Street, a third connection at 2nd Street between T and U Streets. The third location is a metered connection serving Marshall Hall (Bldg #62) only. All three connection points contain meters. This Contract does not include the procurement of potable water and shall not affect the current potable water contract with the District of Columbia Department of Environmental Services.

Potable Water Distribution System.  The potable water distribution system was completely upgraded in 1988. The distribution system is laid out in a classical grid pattern wherein there are no dead-end conditions, except where fire hydrants lead off of main lines. There are approximately 13,375 feet of water lines, and 30 fire hydrants in the distribution system. Of the approximately 13,375 feet of line, approximately 11,935 feet is 8 inch in diameter. All piping 8 inches in diameter or less is poly-vinyl chloride (PVC), and almost all 12- inch diameter piping is ductile iron. An order-of-magnitude inventory report (Inventory Report), containing estimated linear feet, and other information for the potable water distribution system and is included in the following table. The sources of the information contained in these tables include natural gas distribution system maps, real property records and discussions with utility system supervisors. This Inventory Report is provided to assist the Contractor, however the Government assumes no responsibility for any conclusions or interpretations made by the Contractor based on the information made available by the Government.
A study of the Fort McNair potable water distribution system conducted in 1996 found that the pipes are effectively interconnected and there are no constrictions to cause abnormally high pipe velocities. Other findings of the study is that the system has a reserve capacity to deliver additional water with residual pressure greater than 20 psi and that critical fire flows can be accommodated with either one of the service connections out of service. The average age of the system is 20 years.
Figure 15, Fort McNair, Potable Water System Inventory
 

Potable Water System Fire Protection Requirements.  The total potable water demand will also include fire protection. The required fire demand at Fort McNair is for a single fire four (4) hours in duration, requiring 1,500 gallons per minute in addition to 50% of the peak domestic flow that could occur during an emergency.

Service Laterals.  The privatized potable water distribution system shall include service laterals. A service lateral is defined as the smaller-diameter (normally 2 inch or less) lines that connect each building to the upstream distribution mains. The distribution mains are the larger-diameter (normally greater than 2 inch) lines. Service laterals extend to the cutoff valves of the building served by the lateral. The Contractor shall assume ownership from the District of Columbia, Department of Environmental Services delivery points to existing cutoff valves of the facilities being provided potable water.

 
Fort Lesley J. McNair, DC Wastewater Utility Collection System Description and Requirements

Current Service Arrangements.   The Fort McNair wastewater collection system consists of a sewer collection system. There are no lift stations or treatment facilities within Fort McNair.

This Contract does not include the procurement of wastewater treatment and shall not affect the current wastewater treatment contract with the District of Columbia Department of Environmental Services.

Wastewater Collection System.  The Fort McNair wastewater collection system dates back to the 1920s. Since then, wastewater lines have been installed as new buildings were constructed and as wastewater replacement funds were available. Currently there are wastewater construction projects underway. Most of the piping material in the collection system is terra cotta, but recent upgrades have been made using PVC. The wastewater collection system consists of approximately 9,605 feet (1.8 miles) of pipe and approximately 65 manholes. The wastewater generated on the Installation flows by gravity from each building and is delivered to the District of Columbia?s collection lines at five locations. Two connection points are along P Street, two others are along 2 nd Street and the fifth is along 5th Street. An order-of-magnitude inventory report (Inventory Report), containing estimated linear feet, and other information for the wastewater collection system and is included in the following table. The sources of the information contained in these tables include wastewater collection system maps, real property records and discussions with utility system supervisors. This Inventory Report is provided to assist the Contractor, however the Government assumes no responsibility for any conclusions or interpretations made by the Contractor based on the information made available by the Government.
An assessment of the wastewater system conducted in November 1994 identified that all the manhole frames were in good condition with the exception of Manhole AE-11, which was classified as being in fair condition. All the sewer lines were classified as either good or fair. The average age of the system is 20 years.
Figure 16, Fort McNair, Wastewater System Inventory
 

Service Laterals.  The privatized wastewater collection system shall include service laterals. A service lateral is defined as the smaller-diameter (normally 6 inch or less) lines that connect each service building to the wastewater force mains. The collection mains are larger-diameter (normally greater than 12 inch) lines. Service laterals extend to the exterior walls of the building served by the lateral. The Contractor shall assume ownership from the exterior wall of the facility requiring wastewater collection, through the point of attachment with the District of Columbia Department of Environmental Services.

Fort Belvoir, VA, Potable Water Utility Distribution System Description and
Requirements

Current Service Arrangements. The Fort Belvoir potable water distribution system consists exclusively of a water line distribution system, a chlorination booster station, and no water treatment facilities exist. The Fairfax County Water Authority supplies Fort Belvoir with potable water. The potable water distribution system is owned and maintained by Fort Belvoir. The Engineering Proving Grounds (EPG) and Humphrey?s Engineering Center (HEC) is not included as part of the Fort Belvoir Installation as defined for this Contract. The annual potable water requirement for FY 01 at Fort Belvoir was estimated at 594,000 kgals. This Contract does not include the procurement of potable water and shall not affect the current potable water contract with Fairfax County Water Authority.

Potable Water Distribution System. The potable water distribution system consists of service laterals, main valves, meters, sample stations and hydrants. There are a combined four (4) water storage tanks.  An order-of-magnitude inventory report, containing estimated linear feet and other information for the potable water distribution system has been developed by the Fort Belvoir Directorate of Installation Support and is shown in the following tables. The sources of the information contained in these tables are derived from potable water distribution system maps as of September 2001. This Inventory Report is provided to assist the Contractor, however the Government assumes no responsibility for any conclusions or interpretations made by the Contractor based on the information made available by the Government. The potable water distribution system at Fort Belvoir is an older system. An analysis of the system prepared in 1996 shows that over 70 percent of the investment providing potable water service was built in the 1940s and another 7 percent was constructed in the 1950s.

Potable Water System Fire Protection Requirements. The total potable water demand will also include fire protection.

Service Laterals. The privatized potable water distribution system shall include service laterals. A service lateral is defined as the smaller-diameter (normally 2 inch or less) lines that connect each building to the upstream distribution mains. The distribution mains are the larger-diameter (normally greater than 2 inch) lines. Service laterals extend to the building?s main shut-off valve. The Contractor shall assume ownership from the Fairfax County Water Authority delivery points, to cutoff valves of the facilities being provided potable water.

Fort Belvoir, VA, Wastewater Utility Collection System Description and Requirements

Current Service Arrangements The Fort Belvoir wastewater collection system consists of service laterals, collection pipes and mains, manholes and lift stations. The Engineering Proving Grounds (EPG) and Humphrey?s Engineering Center (HEC) is not included as part of the Fort Belvoir Installation as defined for this Contract. Fort Belvoir does own and operate two ferrous sulfate sewage injection points. All sewage generated at Fort Belvoir is delivered to the Utility Company mains and then transported to a Fairfax County, Virginia wastewater treatment plant that is governed by the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors and managed by the Fairfax County Office of Waste Management. Fort Belvoir?s average total wastewater collection for FY01 was 1.27 MGD. This solicitation does not include the procurement of wastewater treatment and shall not affect the current wastewater treatment contract with Fairfax County Public Works.

Wastewater Collection System. The Fort Belvoir wastewater collection system is composed primarily of clay pipe with the remainder comprised of mixed concrete, cast iron, and asbestos pipes.  The pipe ranges in size from 24 inches to less than 4 inches with the most common size of 8 inches. An order-of-magnitude inventory report, containing estimated linear feet and other information for the wastewater collection system has been developed by the Fort Belvoir Directorate of Installation Support is shown in the following tables. The sources of the information contained in these tables are derived from wastewater system maps as of September 2001. This Inventory Report is provided to assist the Contractor, however the Government assumes no responsibility for any conclusions or interpretations made by the Contractor based on the information made available by the Government.  The wastewater collection system at Fort Belvoir is an older system. An analysis of the system prepared in 1996 shows that over 65 percent of the investment providing wastewater collection was built in the 1940s and another 7 percent were constructed in the 1950s. 

Service Laterals. The privatized wastewater collection system shall include service laterals. A service lateral is defined as the smaller-diameter (normally 6 inch or less) lines that connect each service building to the wastewater mains. The collection mains are larger-diameter (normally greater than 12 inch) lines. Service laterals extend to the exterior walls of the building served by the lateral. The Contractor shall assume ownership from the exterior wall of the facility requiring wastewater collection to the points of attachment with the Fairfax County Office of Waste Management.

<DESC>1.  PREAMBLE This announcement is for the re-initiation of an earlier project that was delayed due to urgent support of current hostilities. This announcement constitutes a Commercial Agency Announcement (CAA) and a synopsis of an upcoming solicitation.  This CAA cancels and replaces the related solicitation  SOL N00164-01-R-0135. This CAA is advisory only, alerting industry to the government’s plans to publish a Request for Commercial Offerings (RCO) solicitation, and summarizing the future RCO for industry information.  The Navy is issuing this CAA on behalf of the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Special Operation Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Program and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  A solicitation will be published on or about 5 April 2002 that seeks to award IDIQ contracts to vendor(s) who can provide accessory parts and assemblies for performance impr ovements for a family of Muzzle Brakes and Suppressors (FMBS) for small arms in 5.56mm and 7.62mm to meet the operational requirements of USSOCOM Special Operations combatants.  This CAA is to announce  plans to seek industry ability to supply a coordinated modular family of complimentary muzzle brake/suppressors.  The SOPMOD Program is not seeking alternate sources for the current SOPMOD Quick Detach Sound Suppressor (QDSS), NSN 1005-01-437-0324, as used on SOF weapons, rather is interested in pursuing COTS/NDI extended life, expanded application, high-endurance suppressors that show demonstrable improvements over the standard QDSS.  Sought are improvements in materials, manufacturing process, high endurance coatings, and other unknown technologies that yield extended performance suppressor life to a threshold of 15,000 rounds with an objective of 30,000 rounds under various f iring schedules.  Current M4QD suppressor characteristics for comparative baseline are: length-6.6inches, weight-24 ounces, diameter-1.5 inches, sound reduction-28dB, up to a 2.5 MOA zero shift when fitted to gun, with minor or no loss in instrumental accuracy, endurance to failure under harsh firing schedules approximately 10,000 rounds, and approximately 500 rounds under continuous belt-fed full automatic fire.  These improvements may be Non-Developmental Items (NDI), Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS), or NDI/COTs that can be rapidly developed into suitable items for US Special Operations and Law Enforcement.  This procurement is intended to obtain commercially available/non-developmental item (NDI) Family of Muzzle Brake Suppressors (FMBS) for use by the United States Special Operations Command.  2.  BACKGROUND: Special Operations Forces (SOF) operates around the world in extr eme conditions including underwater, surf-zone, desert, arctic, jungle, and urban environments. They subject their weapons and equipment to extremely high usage rates and stresses. Due to the manner in which SOF utilizes its equipment, normal military specifications are in many cases not stringent enough to support SOF use. Although the currently fielded suppressors for the M4A1 Carbines and SPR meet military performance specifications, these suppressors have exhibited performance characteristics that do not meet all SOF requirements when subjected to the extreme operational conditions imposed upon them by SOF operators.  3.  SUMMARY OF EQUIREMENT  System Description. The family of Muzzle Brake Suppressors consists of four models (1) Close Quarters Battle Receiver (CQBR), (2) Standard Model M-4, (3) Special Purpose Receiver (SPR), and (4) Light Machinegun (LMG). The Muzzle brak e suppressor shall reduce sound pressure levels by 25 decibels and decreases flash signature by 75% when mounted on the prescribed weapon system and that does not change point of impact more than 1.25 minutes (thresholds are 10% less than objectives). Suppressors in like calibers shall fit interchangeably onto standard or replacement compensators. If required, a replacement compensator will be provided with the suppressor and must be installed on the weapon replacing the standard compensator before using the Suppressor. If a replacement compensator is provided, it shall be functionally equivalent and provide flash reduction and compensation performance equal to or better than the current standard M4A1 compensator. All materials required to properly orient replacement compensator shall be provided with each compensator by the vendor. The quick attach/detach type Suppressor is su itable for precision, semi-automatic, and automatic firing. The Suppressor shall not utilize replaceable “wipes” that contact the projectile and require replacement during the full capability service life of the Suppressor.  All FMBS except LMG will interface with 1/2-28 muzzle threads.  Suppressors may, but are not required to, use the current SOPMOD muzzle brake/compensator; Knight’s Armament Company Part #93048 (No NSN available).  If offerors do not use the SOPMOD Muzzle Brake/compensator, a replacement compensator will be provided with the suppressor and must allow installation on the weapon, replacing the SOPMOD compensator before using the Suppressor. If a replacement compensator is provided, it shall be functionally equivalent and provide flash reduction and compensation performance equal to or better than the current standard M4A1 compensator. All materials required to  properly orient replacement compensator shall be provided with each compensator by the vendor, and operator's manual.  There are four distinct functional applications required for the FMBS effort, however 4 separate suppressors may or may not be necessary.  The suppressor requirements for each weapon system are in the attached spreadsheet.  ADDITIONAL requirement – LMG Suppressor although useable for 5.56mm and 7.62mm machineguns, will not allow the installation of a 5.56mm Suppressor onto a 7.62mm muzzle brake/compensator fixture.   The FMBS shall be constructed of corrosion resistant materials that are abrasion, impact and battlefield chemical resistant.  All external and visible surfaces shall be coated with a dull, non-reflective coating.  The FMBSs shall be capable of being submerged in salt and fresh water to a depth of 66 feet for a minimum of 2 hours, surfaced, drained  without disassembly and reliably function in 1-minute (T), 3 seconds (O).  The contract type will be a Firm-Fixed price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  The minimum quantity for each awarded contract is 6/ea FMBSs (First Articles) with a maximum quantity of 10,000/ea for the M4 Carbine and CQBR FMBS variant and a maximum quantity of 4,000/ea for the SPR variant FMBS, all of which may be ordered over the five-year life of the contract.  The following items will be separate line items with 0 minimums: muzzle brakes/compensators (6,000/ea max for M4/CQBR and 4,000/ea SPR); essential installation materials (6,000/ea max for M4/CQBR and 4,000/ea SPR) and a provisioning item ordering clause of $1,000,000.  The contract is F.O.B. Destination.  For the minimum quantity of FMBSs, delivery of the 6/ea is required 90 days after the effective date of the contract (DAC).  A ny subsequent delivery orders will order between 5/ea and 500/ea with a maximum monthly delivery rate of 100/ea.  Delivery of the other line items will be required to commence 60 days after order.  The solicitation will require delivery of 15/ea complete product samples, at no charge to the government, for each suppressor submitted for competition along with a concise technical proposal by the closing date of the proposal.  An additional 15 suppressors will be submitted at no charge to the government, if a suppressor is being submitted for evaluation for more than one weapon platform.  The solicitation will be evaluated on a best value basis and the Government will reserve the right to award to other than the lowest priced offeror and other than the highest technically rated offeror.  The product samples must meet the specifications referred to in the attached spreadsheet in it s entirety to be given further consideration for award.  The technical proposal shall address any differences between the product samples and the production units.  The Government cannot guarantee the condition of the product samples after testing.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS ADVISORY ONLY.  THIS REQUIREMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN PUBLISHED PREVIOUSLY FOR INDUSTRY COMMENT.  DO NOT RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, PLEASE WAIT TO FORMALLY RESPOND TO THE RFP SOLICITATION WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED. The government does not intend to award solely on the basis of this CAA. Nothing in this announcement constitutes an obligation on the part of the government. The government will not pay for submissions resulting from this announcement. The SOPMOD program office will not provide M16/M4 rifle/carbine parts drawings or RIS  parts drawings.  7.  RELATED ANNOUNCEMENTS.  Please do not be confused by related government announcements.  While SOPMOD is seeking Offerors, or teams of Offerors, to provide fully system-balanced offerings for PMOD, certain sub-components and closely related accessories will be competed separately on different solicitations, three of which are:  (A) Enhanced Grenade Launcher Module (EGLM) Parties interested in EGLM should view and respond to solicitation N00164-02-R-0063, which can be found at http://www.crane.navy.mil/supply/synopsis.htm   (B) Extended Life Barrels (ELB).  PMOD Offerors are strongly encouraged to submit Extended Life Barrels, of their own designs and materials, as part of their offerings.  Never the less, government currently intends to also competitively acquire ELB for a wide range of weapons barrels as a separate acquisition.  Parties interested in this  separate ELB project should watch for separate announcements, which will be published.  8.

<DESC>NA Type Of Contract:  Sources Sought Contract Speciatist:  Douglas Stanley, Phone No.:  (916) 557-5190 Project Title:  Sediment and Water Sampling For The Sacramento & Stockton Deep Water Shipping Channel (DWSC)  Location:  Sacramento & Stockton CA Job Description:  Sources Sought:  Seek small business firms capable of collecting sediment and water sampling for the Sacramento and Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel (DWSC) Project.  The work is anticipated to be less than $100,000 over a period of three years.  The DWSC extends from the vicinity of Pittsburgh, California to the Ports of Sacramento and Stockton.  The 44 mile long Sacramento DWSC follows the bed of the Sacramento River to a man made shipway to West Sacramento whereas the Stockton DWSC is in  the San Joaquin River for 37 miles.  Since the channels in general lie offshore, the use of a boat or barge is necessary to obtain the samples. The contractor will obtain sediment samples from the bottom of the DWSC’s.  Doing so requires that the contractor navigate accurately to the boring site and collect core samples up to 15 feet in length.   Sampling can be required at any location in the ful l lengths of the two DWSC’s.  Since the DWSC’s are tidal, the Contractor will have to account for tide stage at the time of sampling to ensure that the sample core extends to the bottom of the prescribed channel profile. Core samples are held between above freezing and below 4ºC until the Contractor delivers them to an analytical laboratory.  Holding times can be as short as 24 hours.  Measures will be taken to ensure that no contamination reaches the core samples.  Water samples from within the DWSC’s will be required at various intervals although usually at fewer locations than sediment cores.  Parties interested in performing the above described work should respond to this notice by submitting a summary of their capabilities, experience, and available equipment to Doug Stanley, Contracting Division; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento Distr ict, 1325 J Street, Sacramento, CA 95814 (916) 557-5190. This Procurement will be conducted under FSC Code: F999, SIC Code: 8999, NAICS Code: 541990.  The size standard for these codes is $5,000,000.00.  All questions should be directed to the Contracting Specialist, Douglas Stanley, at (916) 557-5190, FAX: No.:  (916) 557-5278.   All responses to this synopsis should be in by 20 March 2002.

<SUBJECT>--National Park Service (NPS) Vehicle Design Workshop, March 25-28, 2002
<DESC>NA This special notice is being reissued to reflect the dates of the workshop.  As part of the implementation of new Alternative Transportation Systems (buses, trams, trolleys, etc.) in national parks, the NPS will hold a vehicle design workshop to discuss readily-implementable design concepts for NPS vehicles for the future. It is the hope of the NPS that these concepts can feasibly be accommodated by modifying current production vehicles.  The NPS anticipates that it will ultimately procure these modified vehicles using applicable Federal procurement procedures. The objectives for these new vehicles include: 1) minimizing any impact on natural and cultural resources; 2) enhancing the visitor experience; and 3) promoting the NPS image through vehicle design.  Concepts for transit vehicles wi ll be discussed according to the following categories in breakout sessions: 1) small buses; 2) medium buses; 3) large buses; 4) shuttles and trams; and 5) other vehicles.  The goal of this Workshop is to begin the process to define a realistic and consistent set of design concepts for Park Service vehicles that will be analyzed by the NPS at a later time, and then widely distributed throughout the parks and industry for review and comment.  Vehicle design and manufacturing industry representatives are invited to participate in this conference, through prior registration as defined below.  This is not a marketing opportunity, but rather a limited opportunity to listen to and comment on vehicle needs as presented by the NPS.  There will be no opportunity for manufacturers or concessionaires  to distribute literature or make presentations about a company or its products during plenary, general or breakout sessions.  Guidelines will be provided to workshop participants to assure the NPS meets its meeting objectives and does not violate any federal procurement laws or regulations.  The guidelines will address such issues as: 1) prohibitions on product promotion & advertising;  2) session participation; and 3) adherence to session rules and facilitator directions.  A fee will be charged to cover meals, light refreshments and other costs.  Industry representatives may participate on a first-come-first-serve basis by submitting a written response (and/or email) to Barry Mickela at the Volpe Center (see address information below) identifying the individual(s) who will attend on behal f of your firm, the professional background and expertise (e.g., vehicle design, vehicle manufacture, understanding of Park Service requirements) of each attendee, and the breakout session(s) each of your representatives would like to attend. Only one representative per company per breakout session will be accepted.  Only completed written responses will be accepted. Written responses may be submitted using the various forms of delivery, including e-mail.  The total industry participation will be limited to forty (40) participants. The NPS will restrict attendance at each breakout session to no more than twelve (12) total industry participants.  Participation in breakout sessions will also generally be on a first-come, first-served basis. However, the NPS reserves the right to invite addit ional participants to a particular breakout session and/or to limit participation in order to assure a variety of expertise and backgrounds are represented.  In addition, breakout session topics may be merged or eliminated at the sole discretion of the NPS.  The NPS also reserves the right to  further restrict overall attendance at this conference due to facility constraints and/or government participation.  Please be advised that the design concepts as developed in this workshop will be made available on a public web site for public review and comment.  Send responses and inquiries to: Barry Mickela, Volpe Center, Advanced Vehicle Technologies Division DTS-36, 55 Broadway, Kendall Sq., Cambridge, MA 02142.  Email: Mickela@volpe.dot.gov.  617-494-3589.

<DESC>SECTION C - PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
  
EnRICH: Enhanced and Rapid Improvement of Community Health in Mindanao


I. Introduction:

The purpose of this Cooperative Agreement is to fund viable family planning and health related activities, which will help the ARMM and the local governments directly or indirectly to improve their health status in a sustainable way.

II. Background:

The Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) was created by law in August 1989. Actual turn ?over of governance took place on November 1990. Composing the region are the four provinces of Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi; and the cities of Marawi and Isabela. 

The region has a population of about 2 million. Its four component provinces are among the most depressed in the Philippines with a 51%-54% poverty incidence, according to 1991data from NEDA. About 56% of the population are in the 15-64 years age bracket with an almost equal male to female ratio.

The following health indicators show that the region is one of the lowest 
performers in the nation.



Over the past years, USAID has been providing assistance to the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) through its programs administered under the Office of Population, Health and Nutrition (OPHN).
 
The major USAID/OPHN activities include:
&#61623; Quality Assurance Program/ MGP
&#61623; Sentrong Sigla (Center of Wellness Certification)
&#61623; AIDS Surveillance and Education
&#61623; Control of Infectious Diseases
&#61623; Nutrition (Vitamin A and Food Fortification)
&#61623; Child Survival Programs.
&#61623; Policy and IEC activities
&#61623; Support to Well Family Midwife Clinics

This year, a new project entitled ?EnRICH - Mindanao? will be initiated. USAID believes that it will supplement its other on-going health programs to help achieve Mission Objectives in ARMM.

The health system in the region continues to perform poorly. A number of factors contribute to this. Delivery of health services is affected by armed conflict between Muslim separatists and the military. Displacement of civilian population occurs in some areas. Kidnappings by the Abu Sayyaf ? a known terrorist group, still have not been resolved. During the previous regional government, development funds from the National Government intended for health were not efficiently utilized. The devolution of health services to the local governments has led to poor implementation of health programs and services. And, funding for the health sector in the local municipal budget often receives a low priority among a number of Local Governments.

There is also a general climate of uncertainty and instability in the region, which has slowed down development initiatives in the other sectors, like tourism, further inhibiting improvements in Family Planning, health and other services.

III. Rationale and Objective

Because this region regularly reports the lowest health and family planning statistics, USAID believes targeted, locality specific interventions are needed to improve the situation. 

The objective of this project is to fund viable family planning & health related projects, which will help the region and the local governments directly or indirectly improve their health status in a sustainable way. Under this project, USAID will provide assistance in the form of grants to fund activities aimed to increase contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) and to generally improve maternal and child health. Specifically, the ?ENRICH Grants? aims to:

&#61623; Increase Modern Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) of ARMM, from the lowest figures, to near National levels.
&#61623; Reduce high risk pregnancies
&#61623; Increase Vitamin A supplementation.
&#61623; Improve Tuberculosis Diagnosis and Treatment
&#61623; Improve other maternal & child health indicators

USAID ? accredited Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs) with common health objectives will spearhead the implementation of the projects. 

Activities may include but are not limited to:

&#61623; Community organizing and social mobilization
&#61623; Capability building activities to increase the Local Government Unit?s or the private sector?s capacity to deliver health services.
&#61623; Upgrading, rehabilitation of Primary Health Facilities 
&#61623; Training of health service providers
&#61623; Development and implementation of behavior change campaigns.
&#61623; Installation of information systems.
&#61623; Other innovative FP activities.

The Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao has special difficulties that require a unique approach. With the cooperation and support of the new Regional ARMM government, the local governments, Department of Health and the private sector, knowledge, use and access to Family Planning modern methods and Maternal and Child Health services, will be improved, contributing to the over all development in Mindanao.
