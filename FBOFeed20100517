<DESC>Synopsis:<br />The 309th CMXG/Engineering Group is seeking quotes for the purchase of a Siemens multi-user license part number NX13420 and the associated upgrades under part NX 13420-MT. The proposed item shall include all freight and handling charges delivered to building 265 on Hill AFB, UT 84056.
<p>Siemens is considered the only one responsible source for the purchase of the NX13420 as authorized under 13.106-1 (b). The requested part(s) contain Siemens proprietary information and Siemens owns the data and rights. We could solicit to another company, but this would be extremely costly due to the need to re-establish the existing software. Hence the awarding to any other source would result in duplication of engineering, design, and software costs. The costs would not be recovered through the use of open competition.</p>
<p>RFQ should be submitted by 12:00pm MDT on 24 May 2010. Please refer to the solicitation for more detailed information. The Contract Negotiator information is listed below:<br /><br />Ben White OO-ALC/PKEMC<br />Contract Negotiator<br />6038 Aspen Avenue Bldg. 1289 2nd Floor<br />Phone: (801) 586-8609<br />Fax: (801) 777-4569<br />Email: benjamin.white@hill.af.mil</p>

<RESPDATE>043010
<CONTACT>Jack May, Phone (310) 416-1703, Email jack.may@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW), SBSS F/O Program Office, intends to release a solicitation to acquire a second SBSS satellite that is integrated with the existing SBSS Block 10 ground system infrastructure, in order to ensure continuity of service for the space situational awareness (SSA) space tier. SBSS F/O is an Acquisition Category ID program. The NAICS code for this announcement is 336414 with the applicable size standard of 1,000 personnel.
<p>The objective of SBSS F/O is to deliver space surveillance capabilities to address the SSA needs of the warfighter. The SBSS F/O mission is to collect metric position and Space Object Identification data on manmade Resident Space Objects. SBSS F/O will operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to serve users who require SSA of deep-space and near-earth resident objects. SBSS F/O will be part of a "Family of Systems", interoperable with existing systems, and enhancing the global reach of command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence for Air Force Space Control. The F/O capability will be fielded to mitigate the end of life of the SBSS Block 10 satellite, and the acquisition will be based on existing Block 10 requirements with an expected award in 2nd qtr FY11 and anticipated launch by early 1st qtr FY15. This contract will also include options for interim contractor support, transition support, special studies, and sustainment for up to five years. Proposal instructions and timelines will be communicated via the Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>In order to receive the bidder's library password, a copy of any secret collateral documents, and participate in future Industry Days, potential Prime Contractors must submit a copy of their Facility Clearance Level (FCL) certifying they have a facility authorized for storage and they are authorized to process Secret collateral information as well as the name and number of the respective security and technical POC. The FCL and POCs must be submitted no later than 30 April 2010 to Jim Austin at jim.austin@losangeles.af.mil who will in turn coordinate appropriate method and manner for delivery of the Secret Technical Requirements Document (TRD) to an authorized facility. Response to this notice from small and small disadvantaged businesses qualified to prime this opportunity is encouraged.</p>
<p>Potentially interested prime contractors will be invited to attend our planned Industry Day(s). Our first Industry Day is tentatively planned for 18 May 10. While the TRD is Secret collateral, industry discussions will be held at a higher level. Additionally, the potential bidders must have a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) in place for receipt of additional materials. Each Prime Contractor will be limited to six attendees. Each person attending must have a current TS/SSBI with DCID 6/4 eligibility and be briefed SI/TK that can be validated via the joint personnel adjudication system (JPAS). If JPAS verification cannot be provided, then verification of sensitive compartmented information access from other agencies will be accepted. A Prime Contractor will submit for each person a Personnel Access Request (PAR), Special Access Program (SAP) Format 1, a SF86 that is signed/dated within the last year, a JPAS printout and evidence of a local records check in the last year. If a person is currently accessed to an Air Force SAP sponsored by SYSW, the SF86 is current within the last year and the local records check was accomplished within the last year, then only a PAR with JPAS printout is required. In all cases, the justification for SAP access is "To participate in SBSS Follow-On Industry Day". Anyone not meeting Tier 1 standards will not be allowed to participate in industry discussions.</p>
<p>As stated above, each Prime Contractor must have a SCIF that is either currently accredited by SYSW or must provide documentation showing the Prime Contractor has a currently accredited SCIF sponsored by another agency. Further, Prime Contractors must identify via a one or two page concept of operations, how they will store/process and segregate SBSS Follow-On information, what building/rooms will be used and, if applicable, identify the sponsor of your SCIF who will approve processing and storage of SBSS material in their sponsored facility.</p>
<p>Potential Prime Contractors invited to the industry discussions will receive separate instruction via the invitation to attend identifying the POC for submission of SAP Format 1 PARs and facility documentation.</p>
<p>BIDDERS LIBRARY<br />The RFP and attachments along with any subsequent document releases will be attached and posted under this GPE, https://www.fbo.gov/.</p>
<p>OMBUDSMAN: The SMC Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill. You can reach him at james.gill@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-1789. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns with potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. <br />Pursuant to the SAFETY Act and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 50.205-2(b)(1)(i), SYSW is requesting a pre-qualification designation notice and it is under review by DHS.</p>

<CONTACT>Margaret L Mooney, Purchasing Agent, Email zia3@cdc.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR), hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Sensidyne, Inc. to design, update and manufacture of the Coal Dust Explosibility Meter (CDEM).
<p>Background:</p>
<p>NIOSH developed and produced prototypes of an instrument to measure, in real time, the potential explosion hazard of coal and rock dust mixtures in underground coal mines. This instrument, the Coal Dust Explosibility Meter (CDEM) uses optical reflectance to measure the relative concentration ratio of coal dust (black) to rock dust (white/grey) collected in a coal mine. The CDEM is intended to be used by mine operators and regulators as a screening tool inside the mine to assess the explosion hazard potential in real time and take prudent actions to mitigate the hazard. To use the CDEM in a mine it must be intrinsically safe, that is it must not present a potential to ignite coal dust or flammable gas mixtures that could be present in mines as determined by the Mine safety and Health Administration (MSHA). The prototype units developed by NIOSH achieved this MSHA intrinsic safety requirement. Since the hardware design was finalized in 2006 a number of parts required to manufacture the device have become obsolete, prohibiting the production of additional units without a re-design and a re-assessment of intrinsic safety.</p>
<p>NIOSH is finalizing a recommendation (estimated June 2010 publication) that concentrations of rock dust used to inert coal dust in underground mines be increased to mitigate existing explosion hazards. On April 5, 2010 a large explosion at a mine in West Virginia resulted in 29 deaths. The extent of the explosion implies a potential contribution of coal dust. The recommended standard and the explosion have generated renewed interest in the use of the CDEM and generated internal and external demand which cannot be met at this time.</p>
<p>Proposed Scope of Work:</p>
<p>In order to meet the short term need for additional CDEM units to support continued coal dust explosion prevention research, NIOSH has a need to update the current CDEM design to obtain a new intrinsic safety approval from MSHA and produce a limited number of units. In addition, NIOSH would like the CDEM to be available for purchase by others, such as MSHA, mining companies, engineering firms, academic institutions and safety experts.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Margaret L. Mooney, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Reference 2010-Q-12193. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Sensidyne, Inc, 16333 Bay Vista Drive, Clearwater, FL 33760 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

STEAM TRAPS EVALUATION AND REPLACEMENT 
FOR BUILDINGS 1 AND 2

VETERANS HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OF THE OZARKS
FAYETTEVILLE, ARKANSAS

SCOPE OF WORK

Project Description

 VHSO Fayetteville has experienced a significant increase in temperature of condensate return water to the central steam plant as well as a noticeable increase to the volume of steam relieved to atmosphere (released from vent stacks) from existing condensate return units.  This loss of steam/condensate results in increased operating expenses and the elevated condensate return temperature negatively impacts the service life of system equipment and components. The objective of this project is to correct/mitigate the problem by locating, testing, and servicing (repair/replace as needed) steam traps located in buildings 1 and 2 of the VHSO Fayetteville, Arkansas campus.  The awarded contractor will be required to provide all labor, materials, components, equipment, tools, and supervision to accomplish the scope of work as described herein.  All work must comply with applicable VA standards, NFPA codes, ASME and ASTM standards, and VHSO procedures.  Refer to the accompanying project specifications for detailed requirements, codes, standards, and procedures applicable to this scope of work.

Project Specifications:
01 00 00  General Requirements
01 33 23  Shop Drawings, Product Data, and Samples
23 05 11  Common Work Results for HVAC and Steam Generation
23 22 13  Steam and Condensate Piping and Accessories

Description of Work 

1.	Applicable Buildings (Buildings 1 and 2) and System Description
Buildings 1 and 2 comprise the main hospital facility at the VHSO Fayetteville campus.  Building 1 is four stories and 159,745 gross square feet.   Building 2 is three stories and 35,862 gross square feet.  The buildings are connected by a three story corridor totaling 3,719 gross square feet.  The existing steam condensate return system is gravity return to distributed atmospheric condensate return units which then pump the condensate back to single atmospheric tank in the basement of building 1.  Duplex high temperature pumps (duty/standby, 2 hp, 50 gpm each) then return the condensate to the central steam plant.  High pressure steam (65 psi) is delivered to buildings 1 and 2 from the central steam plant.  Medium (45 psi), and low (5 psi) steam is piped throughout both buildings for a wide variety of uses including sterilization (autoclaves), domestic hot water (semi-instantaneous steam converters), HVAC heating water (shell and tube heat exchangers), HVAC humidification, food services, and radiant heating.  The majority of the known traps are bucket type with the remainder being F&T.

2.	Location of Steam Traps (Survey)
Conduct a comprehensive survey of the existing steam condensate return system to locate all steam traps within the project limits.  VHSO Engineering Service has record of 71  steam traps within the limits of this scope of work (this is based on a similar project from 2007).   VHSO Engineering Service predicts that there are a number of steam traps that have not been previously located or recorded.  Accessing some known traps and some areas for the survey will require infection control measures to be implemented (refer to accompanying specifications for details).  It is anticipated that some work will need to be performed on off hours (see Scheduling under Additional Requirements).  

3.	Testing of Steam Traps
Steam traps will be tested to determine if functioning properly.  Testing must include both temperature (thermal) based and ultrasonic analysis.  

4.	Replacement of Steam Traps   
Steam traps found to not be functioning properly will be replaced as part of this project.  All labor, equipment, and materials necessary to replace the defective traps are to be included in this scope of work.  It is expected that the awarded contractor will not simply replace traps like for like, but that the service will include evaluation of the type of trap for the corresponding application.  

5.	Project Documentation

Submittals:  Provide submittals in accordance with the project specifications.  The awarded contractor will not begin work until the submittals have been approved by the COTR (Contracting Officer's Technical Representative).  Submittals must include (at a minimum) cut sheets on all equipment, components, and materials to be installed under this scope of work and a proposed schedule for the scope of work.
 
Master List:  Provide a master list of all steam traps located.  This list must record the location, type, size, test result (pass/fail), date tested, date replaced (if applicable), and initials of contractor that performed the work.  

Maps of Locations:  Record the location of each steam trap surveyed on VHSO architectural floor plans.  VHSO will provide as-built architectural floor plans in electronic format.  It will be the responsibility of the awarded contractor to record the trap locations as the survey is conducted and provide back to VHSO a CAD drawing noting the locations for each trap surveyed.   

Final Report:  Submit a final report detailing findings from the survey and recommendations for improving the operation of VHSO Buildings 1 and 2 steam condensate return system (including, but not limited to, identification of misapplied types of traps, incorrect trap sizing, and identification of any discovered condensate piping issues).  The final report will include as appendices the Master List of steam traps and the Maps of Locations.


6.	Training of Station Personnel and Special Tools
Provide 16 hours of "hands on" training for VHSO Engineering Service personnel on the testing of steam traps.  The training must cover the testing of each type of trap found in the survey.  The training will be provided in a minimum of 4 separate sessions.  The awarded contractor will provide VHSO Fayetteville an ultrasonic tester equivalent to UE Systems Ultraprobe 3000 (refer to specification 23 05 11 section 2.4.B for further details).  
 

7.	Project Acceptance
Project acceptance will be based on meeting the stated objective of reducing vent stack losses and lowering the condensate return temperature.  The vent stacks from the applicable buildings at project completion should only show intermittent flash releases of steam to atmosphere.  The return condensate temperature should be decreased from the current 205-210F temperature to less than 190F.  If the service performed as part of this scope of work does not accomplish these objectives and the awarded contractor believes that the vent stack losses and/or elevated condensate return temperatures are due to causes outside the scope of this project, the awarded contractor must explain/justify this in the final report to the COTR's satisfaction.  


Additional Requirements/Information

1.	Project Limits (Applicable Buildings)
This project applies to buildings one and two on the VHSO Fayetteville campus.

2.	Project Scheduling and Phasing.  
Station preference is for the scope of work to be accomplished as soon as possible.  The majority of the known steam traps are in areas accessible during normal business hours (primarily mechanical rooms).  It is anticipated that a relatively small percentage of the steam traps will be in areas that will require coordination with hospital operations, which could necessitate off hours work (nights and weekends).

3.	Pre-Bid Conference and Site Visit
A pre-bid conference and site visit will be held for the prospective bidders to attend.  It is highly recommended that all prospective bidders attend.   

4.	VHSO Provided Information,  Coordination, and COTR Contact Information
VHSO will provide current architectural plans and as-built drawings from previous projects in electronic format.  The quantity and detail of existing as-built plans concerning the steam system in buildings 1 and 2 are limited.  VHSO will also be provided results from the most recent survey of known steam traps (April 2010).  The awarded contractor will be responsible for verifying all existing site conditions prior to and during performance of this scope of work and is advised to use as-built drawings only to aid in the survey/investigation.  VHSO COTR will provide coordination for the project and access to applicable areas for the awarded contractor. 

COTR for this project is:

The Statutory Basis for Other Than Full andOpen Competition:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no othersupplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.The continued effort requires further development for computed tomography (CT) forpolymer matrix composite structures and aerospace engine components.  This effort willprovide support in the technical area of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) very specific toNASAs needs and based on extensive prior experience in NASA programs.	NASA Glenn usesNDE to characterize material and structures being developed for aeronautical and spaceapplications.The continued effort includes conducting X-ray and terahertz computed tomography on avariety of materials and structures of importance to NASA programs.  It also includesefforts in visualization, processing, and analysis of data from these methods.	Thevisualizations and volume renderings from the CT data will further be reduced to solidand finite element models in order to perform further NDE simulations and physical testsimulations for mission profiles of interest to NASA.  Digital radiography is alsorequired in this effort, as is facilities development and maintenance related to thesescientific methods.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>NASA/GRC plans to issue a Invitation for Bids (IFB)for the Phase 9 Sewer Repair.This project is intended to complete the rehabilitation of sanitary sewer infrastructureat Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, OH.  This project will involve work on activesanitary, storm and industrial waste sewer systems. These active systems cannot beisolated therefore the project includes a requirement for the contractor to provide formaintenance of flow 100% of the time during construction.There are three distinct work areas that comprise a base bid and two options.  Thisprocurement will be between $2M and $4M.  A summary of work for each area is outlinedbelow.The base bid area, the PSL complex, is a tight site in the middle of the GRC campus. Base bid work includes storm and sanitary sewer installation as well as pavementdemolition and replacement..  To complete the sewer, the following will be required: opencutting of over 300 of PVC pipe between 5 and 25 deep, jacking and boring of 150 ofPVC pipe, installation of 3 oil/water separators, installation of approximately 6 newmanholes and replacement of approximately 150 of carbon steel overhead discharge pipe. The pavement replacement in this area consists of primarily asphalt paving with 2concrete pads for material storage.  The soil within a small area of this site has beenidentified as solid waste soil and will need to be excavated, containerized and hauledoff-site according to applicable codes and standards. Option 1, in GRCs rocket lab area, involves sewer pipe, gas line, and over 30,000 sq.ft. of concrete pavement installation.	When combined, this option includes over 1000 ofgravity flow storm, sanitary and Industrial waste sewers with installation depths rangingfrom 3 to 10. Also included is directional drilling of fusion welded HDPE gas pipe. This option is broken into several segments to allow access to various portions of thesite during construction.  All pavement installed during option 1 will be concretepavement.  The soil within a portion of this site has been identified as solid waste soiland will need to be excavated, containerized and hauled off-site according to applicablecodes and standards.Option 2, the Taylor Road sewer, involves installing approximately 600 ft of gravity flowsanitary sewer and associated structures along with tying into existing buildingconnections at various locations.  Most of the sewer installation is in lawn areas withminimal asphalt pavement and concrete walk replacement required.  This work is alsobroken into segments to minimize the impact to traffic.  The order of magnitude for the procurement is $1 million to $5 million and the effortshall be completed within TBD calendar days after notice to proceed.This procurement is part of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.The NAICS Code and small business size standard for this procurement are 237110 and $33.5million, respectively.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS PROJECT WILL BE FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009.  This pre-solicitation notice is hereby issued in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.704. 

Simplified Acquisition Procedures shall be utilized under the authority of FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.

The Physics Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Boulder, CO, requires a Time Scale System to modernize the current NIST Time Scale. The NIST Time Scale System is one of the most crucial resources for NIST, the nation, and for international coordination of time and frequency. 

NIST is the official U.S. source for time and frequency for civilian applications, and for international coordination of time and frequency. Precise time and frequency, referenced to NIST standards through the NIST Time Scale, underpins critical national technologies such as navigation, telecommunications, electric power distribution, electronic financial transactions, and a wide range of other technologies crucial for the economy, safety, and security. 

The NIST Time Scale is the core of measurements and research that underpin NIST’s most heavily used services (including more than 3 billion synchronization activities over the Internet every day).  NIST participation in international time coordination which underpins many key technologies, and a wide range of NIST research on future atomic clocks and other types of future measurement capabilities. 

The Time Scale System is comprised of two systems: The Frequency Standards Measurement System and the Precision Time Distribution and Time Transfer System.  

Most of the current Time Scale comprises obsolete components and subcomponents that limit the effectiveness of the Time Scale, and threaten the operation of the Time Scale because the old components are no longer manufactured and cannot be replaced if they fail.

The purpose of this acquisition is to procure new components for the NIST Time Scale System, including coordination of and execution of installation, integration, training,   troubleshooting, and warranty management.  

Delivery terms shall be FOB DESTINATION.  The period of performance shall be stated in the request for quotation.  

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  THIS REQUIREMENT IS 100% SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS.

In accordance with the non-manufacturer rule, the manufacturer and distributor of these supplies must be a small business in accordance with the NAICS code identified.  

For size purposes, there can be only one manufacturer of the end item being acquired. The manufacturer is the concern which, with its own facilities, performs the primary activities in transforming inorganic or organic substances, including the assembly of parts and components, into the end item being acquired.  

The end item must possess characteristics which, as a result of mechanical, chemical or human action, it did not possess before the original substances, parts or components were assembled or transformed.  The end item may be finished and ready for utilization or consumption, or it may be semi-finished as a raw material to be used in further manufacturing. Firms which perform only minimal operations upon the item being procured do not qualify as manufacturers of the end item. 

The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number SB1341-10-RQ-0088.

Potential offerors will be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related Amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted.  It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of each potential Offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to the solicitation; the Government will not be maintaining a mailing list.  Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to carol.wood@nist.gov, and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.

<DESC>Background: The Retrieval Group (Information Access Division/Information Technology Laboratory) at the United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) runs large-scale evaluations of information retrieval systems such as document retrieval, question answering, and summarization systems.
<p><br />The work of the NIST Information Technology Laboratory, Information Access Division Retrieval Group includes the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC). One of the main goals of TREC is to promote research in information retrieval (IR) by providing appropriate test collections. IR test collections consist of three parts: a set of documents, a set of information needs called "topics" that can be answered by some of the documents in the document set, and a set of relevance assessments that lists for each topic the set of documents that are relevant to that topic. Contractor personnel play a vital role in the development of a test collection for they are responsible for two of the three components: the topics and the relevance assessments.</p>
<p>The original task in TREC was known as the "ad hoc" task. This task tests a system's ability to retrieve relevant documents on a wide variety of previously unspecified subjects. Typically, an ad hoc test collection includes fifty topics, each with a large number of relevance assessments. The goal of the "Web" track is to examine the kinds of searches that happen on the web. The "Relevance Feedback" track examines how well systems can improve their performance when given examples of known relevant documents along with a query. The "Sessions" track examines the common phenomenon where a searcher issues more than one query for a single search need.</p>
<p>The document collection for the Web, Relevance Feedback, and Session tracks is a collection of one billion web pages collected by Carnegie Mellon University in the early part of 2009, as part of an NSF program to make a large web crawl available to researchers. This collection is meant to represent the top tier of a major web search engine's collection. However, the research community is still learning how to work at that scale - around 25 terabytes of text.</p>
<p>The end result of this project is to use the information gathered from the Contractor personnel to modify, test or improve exiting search engines and also to develop new state of the art search engines. Also, this information is shared with universities around the USA that are developing new ways to search for data on the web. This project is part of the NIST mission of "promoting U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement in science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life". With this project NIST seeks to advance the existing technology and to help create new technologies that help to improve our way of life.</p>
<p>Scope of this Acquisition: This presolicitation notice is for a noncommercial services acquisition for work in the area of search engine research in an effort to improve existing information retrieval systems. The focus of this requirement is the Web/Relevance Feedback/Sessions area. NIST intends to solicit this acquisition under the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (which are for acquisitions valued up to $100,000). NIST also intends to compete this acquisition as a Total Small Business Set Aside under the NAICS code 541990, with a small business size standard of $7.0 million. The period of performance is anticipated to be less than one year. The Government intends to utilize the labor-hour contract type for these services because it is not possible for the Government to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with a reasonable degree of confidence.</p>
<p>Availability of Solicitation: NIST intends to post the solicitation on www.fbo.gov on or about 16 days after this notice is posted. Quotations will be due no later than approximately 17 days after the solicitation is posted on www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Requirement for Active Registration in CCR: Each Offeror must have an active registration at www.ccr.gov to be eligible to receive an award under this acquisition.<br /><br />All questions regarding this acquisition shall be directed by email to the primary point of contact: Keith Bubar at keith.bubar@nist.gov.</p>

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a SOLE SOURCE modification under the existing contract N00019-09-C-0059 with L3 Communications Corporation, Salt Lake City, UT 84116-0850 on an other than full open competitive basis in accordance with FAR 6.302. L3 is the designer, developer and manufacturer of the AN/SRQ-4 incorporated into the ship. The procurement of spares for the AN/SRQ-4 with ECN 187 requires a manufacturing data package which is owned by L-3 Communications. The Government is unable to compete this requirement without the technical data for the AN/SRQ-4 (with ECN 187). Another vendor cannot manufacture shop replaceable assemblies (SRAs) without the technical data .As such, L3 is the only source with the technical data necessary to perform this effort. Questions regarding subcontracting should be addressed to Richard Derrick at 801.594.7092. Therefore numbered note #22 applies to this effort.<br />

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, DC Medical Center intends to solicit proposal from contractors in the metropolitan Washington, DC area to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.  The VA anticipates issuing a solicitation for this requirement on or about May 20, 2010, with a closing date for proposals on or about June 11, 2010.  The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov.  Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies will be made available.  The solicitation will provide full information to contractors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation an any amendments.
The goal of the HCHV program is to remove homeless Veterans from the street or habitation unfit for Veterans and place them in community-based, residential environments with sufficient therapeutic services to meet the needs of those Veterans. Through the HCHV program, VA provides case management services to Veterans and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental health, and rehabilitative services. The purpose of the solicitation will be to obtain proposals from contractors who can provide care, treatment and rehabilitative services to veterans suffering from serious mental illness, including veterans who are homeless, in community-based treatment facilities offering a safe and secure environment that supports their rehabilitation goals.  The Contractor will be required to provide therapeutic and rehabilitative services, but will not be required to provide detoxification or other hospital level treatment - those services will be provided by the VA at VA facilities.  Due to the urgent nature of this requirement, contractors will be required to demonstrate their ability to provide services within a 2-week period after contract award.  Initial contract awards are expected to be on or about July 15, 2010.  Contracts will have a base term of one year, with options for four additional one-year terms exercisable in the discretion of the VA.   
The government will use a best value source selection method under Part 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and anticipates making multiple awards of fixed price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts for this requirement.

NAICS Code is 624229 and the solicitation will be issued for full and open competition. All responsible sources may submit proposals which shall be considered by the Agency.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration data base at www.ccr.gov.  Registration is free and potential offerors are encouraged to visit that CCR website and register as soon as possible to avoid delays should they be selected for a contract award. Questions concerning this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist using the e-mail link provided.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The Project Manager for Maneuver Ammunition Systems, Picatinny,NJ, 07806 is conducting a Market Survey to locate potential manufacturers toproduce improved bandoleers.  Potential manufacturers would be responsiblefor: attaining raw materials, fabricating the final bandoleer product to a Government Tech Data Package (TDP), including acceptance tests and certifications, and final delivery of bandoleers to CONUS locations in supportof ammunition pack-out operations.  The projected production rate is 325,000 Bandoleer units per month.  The improved bandoleer is a textile bag with carry strap utilized to pack and carry 5.56mm ammunition.  The bandoleer body is formed with 5.0oz (approx.) needlepunch polyester material (dimensions of approx. 19.25 x 12.625) that is folded to form the body. The body is folded such that a pocket flap is formed, resulting in an overall 19.25 length and 6.125 height.  Five parallel plunge-style ultrasonic weld seams total, 6.125 in length each, are used to seal the ends of the body as well as define four equal size pockets across the bag length. Each welded seam has a pattern consisting of a single row of welds, each approximately 0.0625 in diameter with 0.250 center-to -center spacing.  Additionally, the end welds are double width (two rows, 0.250 spacing between) and secure between the polyester body layers, a 50 long and 1.375 wide MIL-T-13452 synthetic yarn strap. Ultrasonic welds/seams are inspected using test procedures of ASTM 1682 and ASTM 5170.  The final design has been qualified by the US Army; no redesigns will be considered.  As an alternate to ultrasonic welding, sewing may be utilized only if proven cost effective by potential suppliers. 



SPECIFICATIONS:  This item shall be manufactured to a US owned Technical Data Package (TDP).  

PLANNED ACQUISITION:  Manufacturers shall have the capability of producing 325,000 bandoleers a month.

SUBMISSION INFORMATION:  All interested firms and manufacturers, regardless of size are encouraged to respond to this request for information including current product literature, illustrations, drawings and relevant company background/experience.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement and does not constitute a solicitation or request for proposal. This market survey will be used to provide information on flashlights evaluation effort under the Family of Flashlights (FoF) Program and to introduce 2011-2012 Family of Flashlights (FoF) Approved Products List (APL). The U.S. Army Product Manager, Solider Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-SCIE) is currently seeking qualified sources to provide commercially available flashlights that satisfy the Buy American Act, Sec. 25.101, (a) (1), and (2), and to Sec. 25.103, and Berry Amendment. Interested parties should provide the following information to Mrs. Stella Lee, stella.y.lee@us.army. Mil (e-mail preferred) by 18 June 2010: product literature, product specification, and cost information (both GSA and MSRP prices).  Any information collected shall not be disclosed outside the Government.  All factors, to include cost, will be considered for inclusion on the 2011-2012 FoF APL using a systematic approach. The FoF APL will consist of three categories of flashlights: 1) Hands Free Helmet Light (HFHL), 2) Tactical Handheld Light (THL), and 3) Basic White Light (BWL). An integrated light that offers a basic white light and secondary color(s) and IR, falls into THL category and does not constitute an addition to multiple categories.  If a light does not possess all three integrated:  white light, secondary color(s)  and IR then it will be tested under the BWL category.<BR>Limit 2 flashlights for each category per company, meaning up to 6 flashlights maximum per company. <BR><BR>Selection Process<BR><BR>The selection process for the FoF APL will use a down-select process. This process will consist of 3 Phases: Phase I Physical Characteristics/Lumen Testing, Phase II Technical Testing, and Phase III User Evaluation. A scoring system will be used for Phase II and III. No external lab testing conducted outside of the Army for any phases of testing will be acceptable. All flashlights will be tested to the same procedures through Aberdeen Test Center (ATC). A scoring conference will be held to determine which lights will be selected for 2011-2012 FoF APL Lights will be categorized according to capabilities. <BR><BR><BR>Physical Characteristics/Lumen Testing --Phase I<BR><BR>All candidates must meet all of the threshold performance criteria (Phase I) listed per category in its entirety in order to proceed to Phase II.<BR><BR>The threshold performance criteria for the HFHL are: 1) Must be compatible with the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) and side mountable with no helmet modification, 2a) Must provide 17 lumens for 5 hours, 2b) Must provide a minimum of 3 lumens for 25 hours, 3) Dimensions of entire system with all attachments must not exceed 3in.x3in.x2in., 4) Power source must be AA or Lithium 123 batteries, 5a) Must provide white light and integrated secondary color of red or blue, 5b) and IR capability, 6) Must weigh no more than 4 oz. with power source and mounting accessories, 7) Must be subdued in color (Foliage Green, Desert Sand, Black, and[or?] Urban Gray). <BR><BR>The threshold performance criteria for the THL are: 1) Must provide a clip for secure fastening, 2) Must provide a minimum of 40 lumens continuous for 60 minutes, 3) Dimensions of entire system with all attachments must not exceed 5.8in. in length, 4) Power source must be AA or Lithium 123 batteries, 5a) Must provide white light color and integrated secondary color of red or blue, 5b) and IR capability, 6) Weigh no more than 6 oz. (with power source and standard clip), 7) Be subdued in color (Foliage Green, Desert Sand, Black, and [or?] Urban Gray).  <BR><BR>The threshold performance criteria for the BWL are: 1) Must provide a clip for secure fastening, 2) Must provide a minimum of 40 lumens continuous for 60 minutes, 3) Dimensions of entire system with all attachments must not exceed 5.8in. in length, 4) Power source must be AA or Lithium 123 batteries, 5) Weigh no more than 6 oz. (with power source and standard clip), 6) Be subdued in color (Foliage Green, Desert Sand, Black, and[or?] Urban Gray). <BR><BR>Lumen Testing Procedure<BR><BR>Flashlights will be tested in a Labsphere FS2 Flashliht Spectral Flux Measurement System.  Flashlights will be tested in a field operational configuration by holding the flashlight in the 7. 5 inch input port of the 20 inch sphere. The area between the flashlight and the edge of the input port will be filled with a reducer to prevent ambient light from leaking in and flashlight light from leaking out. A calibration will be performed for each flashlight type by turning the integrating sphere calibration light on while the flashlight is held in position and off. This calibration will be used for all flashlights of this type that are measured in the FS2 Flashlight Spectral Measurement System.<BR><BR>A total of three flashlights per candidate model will be tested for lumens; all three flashlights must pass to advance to Phase II of the selection process. If any of the three flashlights fail the lumen test, the failing light(s) shall be allowed one retest with new batteries. Failing a second time will be deemed a failure for that flashlight candidate model.<BR><BR>Phase II<BR><BR>The candidates which have successfully satisfied Phase I requirements, will then advance to Phase II, Technical Testing. Phase II will consist of 4 environmental tests listed below. 5 new flashlights shall be subjected to each of the tests (20 flashlights total). A minimum of 4 of the 5 flashlights must achieve the testing requirements for each environmental test for the flashlight system to receive a qualifying score.  A failure is defined as not 100% operational.<BR><BR>1.

<DESC>A.	General Information  

The Southwest Region will be standardizing Conventional Needles & Syringes.  This is a re-evaluation of this product group since the Regional Incentive Agreement has expired.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirements of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  In order to meet the total requirements of the Region a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items within a product category) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTFs’ needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. The product category includes Conventional Needles & Syringes that do not have a safety feature.  The entire category of Conventional Needles & Syringes has an annual demand of over $188,000 (Syringes = $139,297; Needles = $49,002).

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program, Cardinal, currently serving the Southwest Region. 

The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Unit’s (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.

The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB.

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP’s Prime vendor program and obtaining a DAPA please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is September 2010.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.   The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.

B.	Products & Performance Required
 
The Southwest Region is seeking product line items in the category of Conventional Needles & Syringes.  The product category includes Conventional Needles & Syringes for adult and pediatric patients.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $188,000 (Syringes = $139,297; Needles = $49,002). This is a re-evaluation of this product group.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirements of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  

At the request of the Southwest Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

C. Instructions to Vendors

If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address, your answers to the technical questions/criteria below and product literature to cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil no later than June 9, 2010.  Submissions must be received by COB, 5:00 PM PST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.  If your product literature is more than 4MB in size, please mail your product literature to:

Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN 
Tri-Service Regional Business Office - Southwest Region 
34800 Bob Wilson Drive, Suite 110 
San Diego, CA  92134 
Phone:  (619) 532-8517

This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

D.	Evaluation Criteria

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process.
Vendors will be required to provide detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and product literature. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.

The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The TRBO will request samples and product literature for the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 PM PST, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   

The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree and 5 = Strongly Agree.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally and individually. The evaluations are conducted in a clinical setting.

Phase III – Pricing Analysis Process.  All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.

<p>SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />RFI-CMS-#CMS-2010-A100779</p>
<p>A. General Information:</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is seeking to identify small, and small-disadvantaged businesses, [Small Disadvantaged, Woman-owned, Service Disabled Veteran-owned, HubZone, 8(a)], with capabilities and/or prior experience, that can provide services as described within the draft statement of work (SOW), entitled, "FMSG Support Contractor ". Additionally, we seek comments from all industry, relative to our DRAFT SOW.</p>
<p>The Office of Financial Management-Financial Management Systems Group (OFM-FMSG), within CMS, in conjunction with its network of contractors, is responsible for ensuring that initiatives related to enhanced and improved financial controls at CMS are developed, implemented, and operated correctly, efficiently, and on a timely basis. Programs and initiatives for which FMSG is currently responsible include; the Health Insurance General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS), Provider-Enrollment Control System (PECOS), FACS, Unified Financial Reporting-UFYMS, One-PI, and Health Insurance Technology (HITECH) incentive payments.</p>
<p>CMS is seeking:<br />1. A Contractor which can supply and manage, well-qualified technical personnel, as required by SOW requirements, to assist FMSG program office staff to manage, command, control, and audit, the design, development, implementation, test, operation and training of various CMS programs, initiatives, and solutions. <br />2. Support and assist FMSG in responding to questions of fact or policy received from Congressional and other outside sources.<br />3. Provide technical personnel to assist in review of requirements documents , design specifications, implementation planning, test plans/results, and review continuing operations as well as deliverables, thereby helping FMSG maintain and enhance the quality of solutions, efficiency of operations, and lower costs/raise ROI.<br />4. Possess business systems which are mature enough to identify, track and charge costs IAW generally accepted accounting practices (GAAP), and can estimate costs in the same manner in which costs are tracked and charged.</p>
<p>The intent of this RFI is to:</p>
<p>1. Identify SMALL and DISADVANTAGED SMALL BUSINESSES (e.g., SBA Certified 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned, HUBZone, Small Disadvantaged, Veteran-Owned, and Women-Owned) who can demonstrate having the necessary technical capabilities and expertise to perform the requirements of the attached Draft Statement of Work (SOW); and</p>
<p>2. Solicit and receive comments and questions from all industry on the attached Draft SOW. Comments and questions are encouraged from all business concerns (e.g. Small and Other than Small/Large).</p>
<p>In addition to submitting a response to the RFI, the CMS encourages vendors to utilize the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fedbizopps.gov) and register on the "Interested Vendors List" in order to promote teaming and/or prime and subcontractor relationships.</p>
<p>B. Project Background:</p>
<p>See attached DRAFT SOW<br />See attached Excel file detailing some types, quality of labor, and work to be performed. (This list is not comprehensive and is provided for illustration only. Please base your response upon review of SOW and your individual judgment.)</p>
<p>C. Procurement/Contract Strategy:</p>
<p>This RFI notice is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). CMS is considering a Time &amp; Materials (T&amp;M) type blanket-purchase-agreement (BPA) contractual arrangement under a forthcoming solicitation to be issued sometime in late FY 2010 with an award in either late FY2010 or early Fiscal Year 2011. It is anticipated that the period of performance to be issued under a solicitation, will be for a 12-month base year period, and four one-year option periods, to be exercised at the discretion of the Government. (FAR 16.601 (d) (1)(ii) allows a T&amp;M contract to exceed three years in duration if the D&amp;F is signed by the HCA).</p>
<p>The BPA contract which will eventually result from this marketing effort is a replacement contract for an incumbent firm which has held the existing contract for four annual periods of performance and which contains one more 12-month option. The incumbent contractor is not a small or disadvantaged small business, and is therefore ineligible to respond to this notice as a prime-contractor. The existing CMS BPA contract, HHSM500-2006-00002B, was awarded with a total dollar order ceiling of $20million. By means of this notice, CMS is making official notification that new unplanned FMSG work requirements require the raising of the total dollar order ceiling From: $20mil, By: $5mil, To: $25mil over the total five years.</p>
<p>Responding firms must be aware that the purpose of the eventual contract which will result from this marketing effort, is to assist and support the CMS-FMSG staff in performing their program office fiscal responsibilities. Therefore, the firm eventually selected must be aware of the significant possibility of organizational conflict of interest (COI), based upon evaluation of all other on-going work. In considering the eventual award of any resulting contract, the CMS will have to mitigate and reduce to insignificance any probabilty/impact of COI.</p>

<DESC>NASA/LaRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources to supplyprimary components for use in aircraft-based and space-based atmospheric science lidarinstruments.NASA is currently conducting market research to identify firms with specialized expertisein the design, analysis, and fabrication of interferometric receivers (field-widenedMichelson or other suitable interferometers) operating at 355, 532, and 1064 nm (devicesneed operate at only one wavelength each).  The following specifications are in draft form and therefore subject to change. Thespecifications are based on NASAs prior use and familiarity with Michelsoninterferometers, and are intended to depict the general performance envelopes desired.	Methodologies for achieving these specifications may be implied or suggested, but shouldnot be considered as limiting or prohibiting alternate approaches (e.g., Mach Zehnderstyle interferometer).	Parties with experience in alternate technologies or approachesare encouraged to respond.  Outputs = 2: standard Michelson output and reflected beam. (Devices shall be fieldwidened to the degree that it can be operated with input light injected at 1-2 degreesoff axis, allowing spatial separation and measurement of the reflected beam.)  Nominal Wavelength(s) of Operation = 532 nm, 1064 nm, 355 nm.  Tuning: interferometers must be manufactured or tunable such that transmitted beampeaks at a specified wavelength near the nominal wavelength with an accuracy of 10 MHz. Method of tuning control must be practical for aircraft and satellite operation of theinterferometer.  Free Spectral Range = 2.0 GHz at 355 nm, 1.33 GHz at 532 nm, and TBD GHz at 1064 nm.  Interferometer overall transmission &gt; 90 % (goal&gt;95%), i.e., sum of power in thetwo output beams must be greater than 90% of the input power.  Input beam divergence = 16 mrad, full angle  Input beam diameter &#8805; 25 mm  Input Polarization = linear S-polarized.  Contrast &gt; 100:1 (goal &gt; 200:1) for s-polarization input.  Interferometer performance at P-pol:  Interferometer(s) shall have a contrast of &gt;TBD:1 for P-pol in both output channels.  Packaging  Monolithic design desired for compactness and robustness and temperaturestability.  Interferometer(s) must be physically capable of operations in aircraft flightenvironments.  Dimensions  Target volume to be less than 280 cubic inches. (LxWxH of approx 8 in x 7in x 5 in)Respondents should have demonstrated capability and experience in the design, analysis,fabrication, and testing of optical interferometers. When responding to this notice,respondents shall address their capabilities and experience in the areas listed below.Respondents shall emphasize how their stated capabilities and experience relate to thespecific performance requirements and challenges associated with developing opticalinterferometers for aircraft applications.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD) is issuing a Sources Sought synopsis from all potential sources who may have technologies or systems relating to the supply of non-magnetic (or low magnetic permeability) air conditioning and refrigeration equipment for mine countermeasures ships. The Navy is considering modernizing all or portions of its existing machinery used to produce chilled water for shipboard air conditioning. The Navy is also considering modernizing all or portions of its machinery used for refrigeration of ships stores. Presently, these systems utilize open drive non-magnetic reciprocating compressors with sea water cooled condensers, although the Navy is considering all potential technologies.  Equipment must be capable of conforming to MIL-S-901D grade A shock requirements, MIL-STD-167-1A vibration requirements, and MIL-STD-461F EMI requirements. Materials must have a relative magnetic permeability of 2.0 or less (by measurement in accordance with MIL-I-17214) after fabrication except for materials that must be magnetic due to function.  Potential vendors must be able to meet latest Department of Defense acquisition restrictions on foreign sources of supply for specialty metals (10 USC 2533, DFARS Part 252).
The Navy is interested in two potential options for air conditioning machinery:
1.  Replacement of air conditioning plant - The chilled water air conditioning plant would need to provide at least 35-tons of cooling capacity with 28-85 degree F seawater inlet temperatures and 44 degree F chilled water outlet temperature.  Ability to maintain capacity in higher seawater temperatures is preferred. Chilled water flow would be approximately 130 gallons per minute.  Power consumption would be no greater than 44.7 kW at 440 VAC, 3-phase, 60 Hz shipboard electrical power in accordance with MIL-STD-1399. Size of plant: No greater than 70 in. (height) x  79 in. (width) x 92 in. (length), not including controller cabinet if required. Weight: No greater than 5294 lb. (wet), or 5000 lb. (dry), not including controller cabinet.  
2.  Replacement of Air Conditioning Plant Compressor - The compressor would need to be capable of being retrofitted onto an existing 35-ton chilled water plant. The compressor would be driven by a 60 HP motor at 1750 RPM and would need to have capacity control system for varying load conditions.  Nominal operating conditions with refrigerant HFC-134a include a discharge pressure of 126 psig, suction pressure of 30 psig, and specific volume as saturated vapor 1.55 ft^3/lb.  Size of compressor: No greater than 31 in. (height) x 34 in. (width) x 31 in. (length). 
The Navy is interested in two potential options for refrigeration machinery:
1.  Replacement of Refrigeration Plant - The refrigeration plant condensing unit would need to provide 0.5-tons of cooling to maintain existing chill storeroom at temperatures of 33-36 degrees F and existing freeze storeroom at temperatures of -3 to 2 F.  Seawater inlet temperature range to the condenser would be 28-85 degrees F, although ability to maintain capacity in higher seawater temperatures is preferred. Power consumption of the condensing unit would be no greater than 3.7 kW at 440 VAC, 3-phase, 60 Hz shipboard electrical power in accordance with MIL-STD-1399.  Size of condensing unit: No greater than 68 in. (height) x 24 in. (width) x 48 in. (length), not including separate control cabinet if required. Weight of condensing unit: No greater than 1278 lb. (wet) or 1200 lb. (dry), not including separate control cabinet.  
2. Replacement of Refrigeration Plant compressors - The compressor would need to be capable of being retrofitted onto an existing 0.5-ton refrigeration condensing unit, belt-driven from a 5 HP motor at 1165 RPM, operating with refrigerant HFC-134a.  Nominal compressor suction and discharge pressures would be 4" Hg vacuum and 135 psig respectively, with condensing water temperature of 105 degrees F. Size: No greater than 20 in. (height) x 20 in. (width) x 18 in. (length).

<DESC>Battelle, Pacific Northwest Division, Management &amp; Operating Contractor for the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is requesting information from prospective offers to provide:
<p>&bull; A Pulse-Amplitude Modulated (PAM) Fluorometer for measuring the photosynthetic properties in cyanobacteria and algae.</p>
<p>The fluorometer unit should be able to determine the photochemical efficiencies (Phi) at both photosystems in cyanobacteria and algae within the same instrument. An additional requirement for the instrument includes a capability to record 77K fluorescence spectra.</p>
<p>An instrument with these capabilities should also be able to facilitate investigations of electron flux, ratio of cyclic-to-linear electron flow, non-photochemical quenching, reaction stoichiometry, state transitions, antenna size, photoinhibition, and multi-algal contamination.</p>
<p>The fluorometer should be able to handle low-cell-density suspensions of cells, e.g., approximately 1 &micro;g/ml chlorophyll.</p>
<p>Modularity of the components is necessary for the use of such an instrument for both cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae. Additional capabilities are in-situ fluorometric determination of NADPH concentration and proton-gradient determination.</p>
<p>Modern fluorometers often come with software, and thus an inexpensive computer may be necessary for operation.</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort that will best address PNNL's needs. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. Battelle does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI.</p>

<a href="mailto:norman.a.krause@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New England</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement to determine interest, availability, and capability of Small Business concerns to provide professional soil science expertise, materials, and services associated with the conduct of two one-week sessions with 30 students each of the U.S. Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Training (REG-IV).  The work will begin in August 2010 and the training sessions will occur during the periods 13-17 September, 2010, and 27 September  1 October, 2010.  The training will be conducted within a 30-mile radius of Boston and is scheduled for Sharon, Massachusetts. The total work effort shall not exceed $25,000.<BR><BR>BACKGROUND: REG-IV is an interagency, multidisciplinary course in wetland delineation based on the current Federal Wetland Delineation Manual and Regional Supplement(s). It provides the student with a basic understanding of the interaction of vegetation, soils, and hydrology in wetlands in sufficient detail to apply delineation methods on routine cases. Upon completion, successful graduates will possess the background necessary to identify wetlands and determine their boundaries for purposes of administering programs such as the Section 404 Regulatory Program. Successful completion is determined by attendance and participation in all lecture, field, and laboratory sessions.  Topics include (a) wetland characteristics (including soils, hydrology, and vegetation); (b) wetland delineation methods; and (c) field exercises in recognition of wetland boundaries.  In New England, the course is conducted by an interdisciplinary team of applied scientists who represent the federal agencies that utilize the Federal Wetland Delineation Manual; participating agencies generally include: US Fish and Wildlife Service; US Environmental Protection Agency; Natural Resource Conservation Service and the US Army Corps of Engineers.<BR><BR>Under this contract, this work will require an individual person to serve as the New England Soils Instructor/SME, to provide local and regional subject matter expertise for the hydric soils portion of a training course on Federal Wetlands Delineation (described in Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual, Technical Report Y-87-1, and the Interim Regional Supplement to the Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual: Northcentral-Northeast Region). This course is a highly regionalized version of the national REG IV course offered by the Corps.  It highlights unique characteristics of New England and draws heavily on real life examples and experiences of the instructors and students.

DESCRIPTION OF TASK UNDER ORDER: The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) has a requirement for a fixed wing aircraft that can accommodate airborne volcanic gas measurement equipment (ports through aft door and passenger window) to conduct surveys.  
Prior to, during, and following periods of volcanic unrest, the AVO typically conducts airborne gas measurements to help determine the level of unrest, likelihood of eruptive activity, and/or progression of an eruption. All are vital elements in determining and assessing the hazards posed by unrest/eruption, particularly with regards to aircraft. In order to conduct these gas measurements, a low-wing, twin-engine, non-pressurized aircraft with modified co-pilot side window and rear cargo door must be utilized. The current state-of-art gas-measuring equipment requires through-the-wall periscope ports, outside air intake and discharge ports, and a thermocouple port. AVO scientists evaluate wind and emission parameters to determine the location of the gas plume, then direct traverses and/or revolutions to be flown under and sequentially through the plume to measure the gases, primarily H2S, SO2 and CO2.
The altitude range for airborne gas measurements is from 500 ft AGL to about 16,000 ft ASL.  Hot-mic ICS is essential as well as seat configuration that permits installation of the gas measuring equipment and easy visual communication between crew members. On occasion, altitudes above 10,000 ASL must be attained, and therefore an onboard oxygen-delivery system is required for pilot and crew. The COSPEC instrument requires a sturdy, secured stand (fabricated to fit with the rear cargo door periscope port) to which it can be affixed during flight; likewise, the Flyspec instrument requires a reinforced shelf (affixed to the inside of modified cargo door). Cargo D-rings are required to secure the gas instrument panel and power source during flight.
Gas-measuring flights can entail tight maneuvering, turbulence, and precision flying (e.g. ability to re-acquire identical flight traverse), and thus pilots who are knowledgeable and experienced with the techniques of airborne gas measurements. 
AVO will provide all photographic and gas measurement equipment to be used on board the aircraft. Equipment will be installed by AVO.
Availability for this work is requested as soon as possible to complete flights lasting approximately four hours each from May 17, 2010 through September 10, 2010.

<DESC>This procurement action is being conducted under FAR 6.302-1 with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c), as only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirement; therefore proposals cannot be submitted directly on this notice.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to award a sole-source Lease Contract to the Massachusetts Port Authority, whose address is One Harborside Drive, Suite 200S, East Boston, MA 02128-2909.  TSA has occupied 1,137 square feet of office space known as the Fish Pier since March 17, 2006. The space is utilized as administrative space by the Transportation Security Administration’s Rail Inspectors Group.  Because the function of this group is not directly related to the screening of passengers at the airport, this space is most conveniently located off airport property. 

The Transportation Security Administration intends award this lease under the authority of FAR 6.302. This sole source procurement is based on 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) which states that supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and substantial duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through competition. 

This is a notice of intent to award a sole source procurement action and is not a request for competitive proposals. All interested firms must respond by Monday, June 29, 2009 at 2:00 p.m. local Washington D.C. time to Antoinette Glover, REF: HSTS01-09-L-RIN026, Antoinette.Glover@dhs.gov. 

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Transportation Security Administration will not reimburse for any costs connected with providing the capability information.

<DESC>RECOVERY  PER FAR 5.7, THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY; THERFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY.  THIS OPPORTUNIY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER:  The Mobile District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is placing a task order against Contract No. W91278-07-D-0088, 3001, Inc. Fairfax, Va. dated  27 July 2007, which has already been competed and awarded as an Indefinite Delivery Contract for Supplies and Services to support  the Joint Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise (JALBTCX), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District.<BR><BR>TASK ORDER #18. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Joint Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise (JALBTCX) requires equipment spares to support operation of its airborne sensor suite, to buy-down risk associated with equipment failure. The JALBTCX operates an airborne coastal mapping and charting system consisting of a bathymetric & topographic lidar, hyperspectral & photogrammetric imager 365 days per year world-wide to accomplish its coastal mapping and tactical nautical charting missions for the USACE and the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office.  Support equipment to field office operations are subjected to constant wear and tear from packing and unpacking, shipping, and transport in field vehicles. Successful airborne sensor suite field operations and product delivery relies on a combination of good weather and water clarity, occasional operational constraints on solar angle and stage of the tide, and aircraft, sensor, and support equipment health.  These last three are the only ones that can be influenced by human intervention.  The aircraft travels with an engineer and a set of spares with which to make repairs so that aircraft health is rarely a constraint on operations.  Spares for the major sub-components of the airborne sensor suite were purchased through a previous task order on this contract. This task order addresses a requirement for spares of the major field support equipment items, so that field operations can continue uninterrupted in the event of failure of the existing field suite equipment.<BR>

The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:<BR>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<BR>adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the<BR>actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of wash and wear materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government<BR>contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.<BR>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<BR>Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006,<BR>unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the<BR>Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<BR>http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL)<BR>Web site at http://wdol.gov/.<BR>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard<BR>Form 1444 (SF 1444)}<BR>Conformance Process:<BR>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.<BR>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<BR>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<BR>occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).<BR>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in<BR>order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for<BR>each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.<BR>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a<BR>report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinentinformation including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division,<BR>Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<BR>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to<BR>process the request.<BR>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the<BR>contractor.<BR>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<BR>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond<BR>paper.<BR>When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of<BR>Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

<p>Subject: Differential Scanning Calorimeter Machine</p>
<p>Solicitation Number: FDA1072754</p>
<p>Response Date: 27 May 2010</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 13.5.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-33.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 for full and open competition.</p>
<p>The FDA intends to issue a firm fixed-price purchase order for a Differential Scanning Calorimeter Machine that meets or exceeds the following specifications:</p>
<p>Temperature Range: -75&deg;C to 500&deg;C. This temperature range must be accomplished through the use of mechanical cooling without the need of using liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p>Calorimeter Sensitivity: The Indium peak height/width ratio (i.e., response ration) of the calorimeter must be &gt; 50. The indium peak height/width ratio is a measure of the sensitivity and resolution of the DSC instrument, with higher value indicating higher sensitivity and better resolution.</p>
<p>Robotic Auto-sampler: Because this instrument will be used extensively, and often on a 24 hour basis, it must come equipped with a robotic auto-sampler containing at least 40 sample positions which shall be controllable through a touch-screen display, or by some other means independent of the controlling computer. In addition, as the sample pans employed may vary from run to run, the auto-sampler must also be capable of exchanging the reference pan (at least three positions) and accommodate a variety of DSC pan types, including but not limited to: standard, hermetic, open, and high-volume pans. The calibration of this auto-sampler should be automated such that a typical user can fully calibrate the system in less than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Purge Gas Control: The DSC should include digital mass flow controllers for at least two separate purge gases, such that the purge gas can be automatically switched via software during the experiment. The flow rate must also be adjustable via software during an experiment. The flow rates must be data logged into the resulting data file.</p>
<p>Cell Replacement: Due to the anticipated heavy use of this instrument, it may be necessary to periodically replace the DSC transducer cell. This replacement must be accomplished by the user, without the need for a service visit. The instrument should also accommodate specialty cells, such as a high-pressure cell, as it may also be used to study super-critical reactions. These specialty cells should be user-replaceable, and require little or no special installation.</p>
<p>Temperature Modulated DSC: The instrument must be capable of performing temperature modulated DSC experiments over the entire temperature operating range and must be capable of performing these experiments in heating, cooling, or pseudo-isothermal modes (pseudo-isothermal is defined as an average isothermal temperature with superimposed modulation). The pseudo-isothermal mode is critical for our research, as we intend to study time-dependent effects on heat capacity at isothermal temperature.</p>
<p>The modulated temperature profile must be a regular, periodic function of known amplitude and frequency to ensure steady state control during the experiment, as well as experimental reproducibility. Random temperature perturbations are less reproducible and as such are not acceptable for our research.</p>
<p>Software: As this DSC will be used by numerous researchers, it is critical that the analysis software be un-keyed, and should include a site license such that it may be installed (if-needed) on an unlimited number of computers within the FDA. The data file format should easily allow sharing/transfer of data files as individual electronic documents. The data analysis program should also include a .pdf generator, for the efficient export of analyzed plots. These capabilities must be demonstrated for product acceptance.</p>
<p>The user must be able to monitor record and access both the raw signals, as well as the deconvoluted signal [including heat capacity, total heat flow, heat flow phase, modulation-dependent (heat capacity) heat flow, and modulation-independent (kinetic) heat flow] in real time, while the experiment is being performed.</p>
<p>In addition, the instrument software must be capable of performing a series of auto-diagnostic tests, either manually or through the scheduling component allowing for the instrument to be fully calibrated and verified automatically, without the need for operator presence. Calibrations must include baseline, cell constant, and temperature. Scheduling capabilities must be present, such that these calibrations and/or verifications can be programmed to perform during normal quiescent periods, such as overnight or on weekends. Options for additional tests verifying the performance of various instrument components such as auto-sampler, motors, electronic boards, mass flow controllers, etc. must also be present.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS DEADLINE: all questions must be received by email (george.gonzalez@fda.hhs.gov) before 1:00 pm (1300) EST on 21 May 2010.</p>
<p>Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means the contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. <br /><br />Award will be made to the party whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared inaccordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additionalinformation included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the onlysolicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.THIS PROCUREMENT IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is currently developing basic scientific data on theflow and noise of rectangular nozzles for advanced aircraft. A series of interchangeablemodel-scale test nozzles have been conceived and an initial set of nozzles designed,ready for fabrication. The designs are expressed as solid models with annotated views anddescriptive text, contained in the attached Statement of Work (SOW) and CAD files.This notice is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) so that NASA GRC can obtainproposals from knowledgeable and capable vendors to fabricate and inspect the hardwaredescribed in the provided SOW.	Addition requirements and clarifications not included in the SOW:1.) Although this is presented as one task, the proposals should be split into twoseparate sections including cost and schedule quotes for each. Section 1 includes allparts with a 2:1 ratio; Section 2 includes all parts with a 4:1 ratio. Splitting the taskmay be necessary to meet the delivery date of 9-1-10. To clarify which parts are in whichsection:Section 1: NA2Z, NA2B1, NA2B2, NA2K1, NA2C1, NA2C2, NA2C3, and NA2BC1.Section 2: NA4Z, NA4B1, NA4B2, and NA4K1.2.) It is highly recommended that this task is not divided into any more sections thanspecified above as far as using different sources or set-ups to insure the best possiblefit ups and transitions between mating parts.3.) All parts must be made from one piece. Splitting in half and then welding backtogether before finishing is not permitted.4.) The 2:1 and 4:1 round to rectangular adapters (DR2A2 and DR2A4) will be provided forassembly checkout and inspection tentatively by July 15, 2010.5.) All the nozzles have 10-24 threaded holes at 45 degrees to the x-axis used to attachto the appropriate upstream round to rectangular transitions. The model shows threads onthe part of this hole that is not a complete diameter (due to the angled surface itintersects). This was not intended and will accept a counter bore or possibly a countersink to the point where a full thread begins but the exact geometry has not as yet beendetermined. A minimal amount of stock shall be removed to facilitate this and the exactdimensions will be provided.6.) The requirement for written biweekly technical progress reports shall also includeRisk Management. This would include a list of significant open risks for cost, schedule,or technical performance, and associated mitigation plans.

Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 210 & 211 - CGMP regulations for supplying medical grade oxygen.

29 CFR 1910.104    Applies to the installation of bulk oxygen systems on industrial and institutional consumer premises 

49 CFR - Transportation

Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act

NFPA 50: Standard for Bulk Oxygen Systems at Consumer Sites, 2001 Edition

NFPA 99: Standard for Health Care Facilities, 2002 Edition

U.S.P. 23    

Density data and volume measurement equivalents published in Compressed Gas Association Pamphlet No. P-6, titled "Standard Density Data, Atmospheric Gases and Hydrogen," shall be used when necessary to convert measurement of gases from one form to another.  For example, the following conversion factor shall apply for conversion from gallons to cubic feet. 

Calculation based on data in CGA P-6

1 ftÂ³ liquid O2 = 860.6 ftÂ³ gas (Table 1)
1 ftÂ³ liquid O2 = 7.48052 gal ((Table 2)

Therefore:

7.48052 gal (1 ftÂ³) liquid O2 = 860.6 ftÂ³ gas

1 gal liquid O2 = 860.6 ftÂ³ gas
                             7.48052

1 gal liquid O2 = 115.05 ftÂ³ gas 
or more commonly quoted as 1 gal liquid O2 = 115.1 ftÂ³ gas

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), Management and Operating Contractor of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Idaho National Laboratory (INL), is requesting expressions of interest from prospective vendors to provide a test-bed vehicle capable of testing a wide range of energy storage systems (ESSs) intended for use in electric drive vehicles that must be connected to the electric utility grid for recharging. These grid-connected electric-drive vehicle (GCEVs) technologies will likely include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), pure battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and extended range electric vehicles (EREVs). The test-bed vehicle will be used to test ESSs in an on-road testing program, including closed test track testing. Dynamometer testing will be conducted within the DOE laboratory system. While the testing focus will be on ESSs, GCEV power electronics, motors and other components may also be tested.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">This expression of interest shall serve as a method of screening potential vendors. Only qualified vendor candidates will receive a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) from BEA.</span></p>

GOVPAY
GOVPAY ELECTRONIC INVOICINGAll payment requests must be submitted electronically through GovPay.  "Payment request" means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment by a contractor. To constitute a proper invoice, the GovPay payment request must conform to the requirements identified in FAR 32.905(b), "Payment Documentation and Process" and FAR 52.232-25, "Prompt Payment (OCT 2008)". To ensure the timely processing of invoices GovPay uses an automated "workflow" process to route invoices for review, approvals and payment; as required by the "Prompt Payment Act". Detailed GovPay information for use of GovPay may be obtained on the Internet at www.govpay.gov.  This web site includes user manuals, training resources, instructions for registration and contact information for the GovPay help desk for additional support.  All users can access reports on the status of their invoices. Supporting documentation shall be attached to the GovPay invoice in the form of "flat files" in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) and an Adobe PDF file.  There is a 15MB limitation on file size for these attachments, per header or line item.  Facsimile, e-mail, and scanned documents are NOT acceptable electronic forms for payment requests.   GovPay uses the contractor information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as one of the components for validating contractor registration.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to submit accurate and current CCR information.  Failure to register and maintain CCR information, or if it has expired, been suspended, been deleted, or could not be found, will result in rejection of your invoice.  An invoice submitted during the period for which information in the CCR could not be verified must be resubmitted for payment after successfully registering or updating registration in CCR.  Contractors are encouraged to review their CCR information to ensure the most current information is available for GovPay. The CCR Assistance Center is available to provide assistance and answer questions.  They can be reached at 1-888-227-2423 or on the web at http://www.ccr.gov. [End of clause]

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-40.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However, this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Precision Engineering Division (PED) is principally engaged in the development and dissemination of dimensional metrology and measurements in support of US industry. The rapid rise of nanotechnology and the formulation of promising new products with unique materials properties have raised concerns about the behavior of ultra-small components from the environmental health and safety as well as from the manufacturing quality-assurance points of view. For the past three years, PED has been the lead laboratory on a NIST Innovations in Measurement Science project called the Fate of Nanoparticles in which measurement aspects of bio-distribution and cellular uptake of nanoparticles are being investigated.</p>
<p>A significant area of interest to this project lies in the field of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems (NDS). NDS consist of complex assemblies of biomaterial components including targeting proteins and payloads of imaging agents, diagnostics, gene therapy, and/or drug molecules designed with the ability to traverse the bloodstream and be selectively adsorbed only by cells or tissue selected for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>In order to fully account for the size and stability of NDS formulations received from our collaborators, it is necessary for us to qualify that the starting materials used to develop and test these formulations remain constant over the course of our investigations. This implies that we must be able to determine the chemical composition of NDS components and complexes on a regular basis. Since the formulations often contain biomaterials which are extremely expensive or available only in very small quantities for characterization studies, it is imperative that the chemical analysis be selective enough to resolve one specific component in a mixed sample solution and be sensitive enough to make multiple analytical measurements on a few nanoliters of solution.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a complete LC-MS System. All equipment must be new. Refurbished and or remanufactured shall not be considered for award.</p>

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) High-Power, High-Performance Vanadate Laser at 532 nm. ***

Background:  

The Atomic Physics Division of NIST’s Physics Laboratory undertakes basic research in support of NIST’s missions and priorities.  A high-power, high-performance vanadate laser at 532 nm is required for the following projects:

1.	The required laser will be a basic component for planned experiments to advance the art of making precise measurements of atomic transitions in engineered atoms, with the goal of studying cold hydrogen-like atoms in ion traps;

2.	The required laser is needed for exploring techniques to generate Ryberg states with large angular momentum, thus engineering an ideal system for precision measurements of fundamental constants of particular interest in metrology;

3.	The required laser will be a key component in developing a Titanium:Sapphire laser system that will be both high-resolution and tunable over a wide range of wavelengths.  Such a single-frequency laser system can be used in conjunction with an optical frequency comb, to enable high-precision absolute frequency measurements in the IR and visible regions. 

***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:

Line Item 0001: One (1) High-Power, High-Performance Vanadate Laser at 532 nm, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications: 

This must be a solid-state laser employing a vanadate crystal as gain medium that is pumped by diode lasers to provide high-power, single-mode output at 532 nm with low noise and narrow spectral linewidth. Its intrinsic linewidth (due to spontaneous emission only, excluding pump and environmental noise sources) must be 1 Hz or better. The quality of the laser beam and servo control shall be suitable for precision spectroscopy and laser cooling.   

  I.  Laser specifications and requirements:

1.	Laser shall produce at least 18 Watts of continuous-wave (CW) power at 532nm (green) wavelength of the laser light.

2.	The laser shall be single frequency and mode-hop-free to ensure the lowest possible noise and the longest possible coherence length. Without any wavelength stabilization, the spectral linewidth shall be less than 5 MHz over 50 msec; using PZT wavelength stabilization (see section III), the laser shall be capable of sub-MHz time-averaged linewidth.

3.	The optical noise of the laser output shall be less than 0.03% rms measured from 10Hz to 1GHz.

4.	Near diffraction-limited output beam quality M2 < 1.1 ; beam diameter shall be between 2.0 to 2.6 mm, measured at a distance of about 0.5 m from the output port, with beam divergence of less than 0.5 mrad.

5.	Laser head shall be sealed to prevent dust from entering the cavity, and shall operate properly without alignment or cleaning of optics.

6.	To ensure the longevity of the diode bars which pump the vanadate crystal, the pump-diode bar material shall not contain any aluminum in the active area—thus eliminating the main failure mechanism of diode lasers, namely: catastrophic optical damage due to oxidation of aluminum at the diode facet.

7.	Replacement pump-diode packs, housed in the power supply, shall be connected to the optical fibers via an SMA type connector, for convenience.  It shall not be necessary to feed the fiber in and out of the umbilical cord when changing the diode bars.

  II. Laser-head Tunability, Control and Monitor Requirements:

1.	The power supply shall have at least one type of computer interface (such as RS232 or USB, or both). There shall be adjustment on the power supply to vary the output power of the rated output.
  
2.	The pump diodes and the laser head shall be monitored with separate hour meters.

6.	Problems Encountered – include information regarding information regarding any problems encountered on the contracts described above and corrective actions taken to resolve those problems.
Acceptance of Terms and Conditions: This is an open-market solicitation for equipment as defined herein.  The Government intends to award a Purchase Order as a result of this solicitation that will include the clauses set forth herein.  The quotation should include one of the following statements:

“The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition.”

OR

“The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:

Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)

Note: This procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC).  If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price.  However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offeror’s FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.

QUOTATION EVALUATION: 

Evaluation Factors

Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Experience, 3) Past Performance, and 4) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price. 

Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.  If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST’s requirements. 

Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offeror’s experience providing similar equipment. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same equipment they are proposing for the current requirement. 
Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years.  In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror’s past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.  

Past Performance, Experience, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.

WORK TO BE PERFORMED:

Statement of WorkMaintenance of Telephone and Associated SystemsNational Park Service - Ellis Island and Liberty Island
1.	INTRODUCTIONThe specifications in this Statement of Work (SOW) cover the maintenance services that must be provided for the National Park Service's telephone and associated systems on Ellis Island and Liberty Island. Each island has its own NEC NEAX2000 IVS PBX, and the two are networked together by CCIS via a T1 link. The telephone systems were originally installed in the summer of 1999. There are no direct outside trunks on the Liberty Island switch; instead the trunks on the Ellis Island switch carry all outside calls. Centralized voice mail and call accounting systems serving both telephone systems also reside on Ellis Island. The voicemail system was upgraded to a NEAX AD-64 in late 2005, and the call accounting system is TAPIT for Windows. All inbound calls to both islands are answered by the Auto-attendant on the AD-64. Component details of each system are given elsewhere in this SOW. Since personnel are on Ellis and Liberty Islands twenty-four hours per day, it is imperative that the telephone and associated systems be kept in good working order, and that malfunctions be dealt with promptly. 2.	SCOPEThe components of the systems listed in this SOW, plus their software and interconnections must be covered by the maintenance services.  This SOW and the contract line items provide for two types of service.  One type of service required is remedial maintenance, why is broken down into two categories of major and minor malfunction.  The primary difference between these two categories is response time.  Major malfunctions require a response time of two to four hours 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Minor malfunctions require a 24 hour response time Monday through Friday during normal business hours which for the purpose of this SOW is determined to be between the hours of 8:00 AM and 5:00.  The second type of service is to cover routine actions such as equipment moves, additions or changes.  To support these two types of services the contractor will provide pricing under an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract.  Remedial maintenance will be provided under a per call pricing with separate pricing for major malfunction calls broken out by; normal duty hours, outside normal duty hours Monday - Friday; and weekends and holidays.  Minor malfunction will have just one pricing structure since it is planned that these will only be required during duty hours.  The government will place an order for 8 hour at the time of award; which will provide the contractor a guaranteed minimum for the contract. 
2.1.	Remedial MaintenanceThe vendor must provide remedial maintenance services, which are defined as maintenance services performed on an unscheduled basis when there is an equipment or software malfunction. Repair or replacement of a malfunctioning component is the responsibility of the vendor.2.1.1.	Service AvailabilityThe vendor's service organization must be reachable and available 24 hours per day, every day of the year, to deal with system malfunctions. The vendor must provide a specific contact telephone number for customer reporting of system problems.2.1.2.	Major MalfunctionA major malfunction is defined as a malfunction that materially affects a system's call processing capability, and includes, but is not limited to:"	the failure of any system feature required for call processing"	a malfunction affecting 10% or more of the stations on Ellis Island or 15% or more of the stations on Liberty Island."	a malfunction affecting 15% or more of the lines in any of the trunk groups on either switch, except that a failure affecting a lesser percentage of lines that materially affects call processing (e.g. the lead number in a hunt group) is also a major malfunction2.1.3.	Minor MalfunctionA minor malfunction is any malfunction not defined as a major malfunction.2.1.4.	Response Times2.1.4.1.	To Major MalfunctionThe vendor must make a best effort to respond within two hours, and in no case greater than four hours to a trouble call placed concerning a major malfunction. It is recognized that there may be some delay in getting onto Ellis Island or Liberty Island. Therefore, depending upon the circumstances and arrangements made, the four hour maximum will be from the time the trouble call was placed to the time the vendor's technician(s) arrive at:"	the guard house (Post 4) to the entrance of the bridge connecting Ellis Island to Liberty State Park, or"	the commercial ferry service at Battery Park, or"	the guard house (MIO) near Battery Park where the National Park Service boats depart2.1.4.2.	To Minor MalfunctionMaximum vendor response time after a trouble call has been placed concerning a minor malfunction must be less than 24 business hours.2.2.	Moves, Additions, and ChangesAt the request of the National Park Service, the vendor must provide labor and materials to effect moves, additions, and changes to the systems. The vendor must provide a rate schedule of labor charges and the days and times at which they apply. This rate schedule must include the charges for on-site labor during and outside normal business hours, as well as for weekends and holidays. In addition, the rate schedule must include the charges for work done through remote access and the days and times at which they apply.2.3.	Technical SupportThe National Park Service currently performs some tasks on the systems relating to administration, moves, additions, and changes. From time to time questions arise while performing these activities. The vendor is expected to cooperate in responding in a timely manner to occasional reasonable requests for information without charge. 
2.4.	Remote AccessThe vendor must have the capability for remotely accessing the PBX's and the voice mail system for diagnostic, maintenance, and administrative purposes. Remote access must be part of the vendor's normal operating procedures with its customers. The Ellis Island and Liberty Island systems are currently configured to allow for remote access.
3.	OTHER REQUIREMENTS3.1.	Authorized DealerThe vendor must maintain status as an authorized NEC dealer and the vendor's technicians must be certified to work on all of the Ellis Island and Liberty Island system components, including the voicemail system.3.2.	Component Provision, Replacement, and UpgradeAll component hardware or software supplied as replacements during remedial maintenance or as part of an upgrade, expansion, or other change must be new standard parts. Components that are no longer manufactured, and for which there are no approved substitutes, may be replaced by refurbished parts so long as they are clean, in good physical condition and function to specification.

Additional FAR and DFARS clauses required by the regulations will be included.

Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, has determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an “Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)” be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an “Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)” be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the “Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)” or the “Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only)” option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the “Invoice” option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.  


ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS (NAVY)

WAWF PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR NAVY CONTRACTS
 
The Navy approach to receipt, acceptance, and payment presents unique requirements in orders written on behalf of the Naval Media Center (NMC) that now must be processed for payment through WAWF.  The distinction between receipt and acceptance, much as it was for the Enterprise Resources Program (ERP), remains critical.   The NMC Supply Officer, Jim Kuhrt, is the current accepting party.  This fact would have to be added as text within the order since his DoDAAC will differ from the actual delivery address, which would be shown in Block 15 of the SF Form 1449. Directions for processing payments through WAWF for the NMC should be inserted as follows:
 
WAWF INVOICE PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS.
 
WAWF contractor input information.
 
The contractor shall use the following information in creating electronic payment requests in WAWF:
 
To create electronic payment requests and receiving reports, go to the WAWF-RA production website at https://wawf.eb.mil
 
Select invoice type:
 
            If billing for materials only, select “Combo”
            If billing for materials and services, select “Combo”
            If billing for services only, select “2-n-1”

NOTE WHEN INPUTTING DODAAC ON WAWF FOR PAYMENT:
 
The payment office will always be DoDAAC HQ0251
The Local Processing Office will always be N00024
The Ship To will always be N49872
 
You will have a Ship To on your PRs that is not N49872 therefore, you will need to let the vendor know that in order to process an invoice in Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) they must not use the DoDAAC that they actually shipped to.  For example, you may have a PR ship to DoDAAC code of N42315 and the vendor should ship to that DoDAAC, but he/she must input ship to DoDAAC N49872.  Yes, this is confusing… Yes, this does make additional work for you… See the attached WAWF payment instructions for further information.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples. 

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

6.1  Bulk oxygen is ordered by and delivered to VAMC Togus.  The list of locations and information regarding their unique delivery requirements is included in the solicitation schedule.  

6.2  The contractor shall deliver medical-grade liquid oxygen within the time-frame specified in the schedule for each location.  The time-frame identified may be either the number of calendar days after receipt of the Government's order, the specific days of the week for delivery, the specific time intervals between deliveries, a specified reorder point, or other specified ordering and delivery methods.  If the time frame for contractor delivery is not identified in the facility requirements, the contractor must provide 24-hour notice prior to delivery or upon mutual agreement between the facility and contractor, alternate ordering/delivery methods such as pre-scheduled deliveries, calling for tank level readings, installing a telemetry unit, etc. may be arranged.  If for any reason the contractor is unable to deliver at the agreed upon day or time, the contractor will provide 24-hour notice to the COTR, so that the facility can initiate an alternate backup action.  In accordance with VHA Patient Safety Alert dated April 5, 2004, all deliveries must be monitored by a qualified and trained technical representative that will be designated by each facility.  Contractor will be provided with names and contact information of primary and back-up facility representatives.  This applies to all deliveries regardless of time or day of execution.  

6.3  Tanks(s) will be filled to maximum functional capacity at each refilling procedure unless otherwise specified in the facility requirements or as agreed upon in a written document signed and dated by the COTR.        

6.4  At the time of each delivery, contractor must provide a legible signed and dated written document that identifies the tank level prior to fill, the level after fill, and the quantity delivered.  This document must be counter-signed by the facility representative supervising the delivery.  

6.5  Emergency delivery will be provided within 24 hours after receipt of Government notification.  Contractor must respond to the facility by either telephone or email within one hour to confirm receipt of emergency notification to ascertain the nature of the emergency.  Emergency status is determined by the Government when conditions warrant, such as an actuated main bulk tank low level alarm, imminent alarm condition, or system leak.  Failure of the contractor to remain current with agreed delivery schedule and requirements does not constitute an "emergency" for purposes of charging an emergency delivery fee.  


7.  Quality Assurance Specifications and Requirements      
 
7.1  All medical gas manufacturers and fillers of medical gases must be registered with FDA as drug manufacturers.  All oxygen shall be manufactured, processed, packed, transported, and stored according to FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) regulations, and all labeling shall comply with FDA's labeling regulations (21 CFR Part 201).   
       
7.2  All liquid bulk oxygen delivered under the contract shall be medical-grade and shall meet or exceed the standards cited in the current edition of the United States Pharmacopoeia/National Formulary (U.S.P.). 

7.3  A valid certificate of analysis shall be provided with each delivery of liquid oxygen.  The certificate shall include, at a minimum:
	a) Supplier's name and complete address
	b) Name of the Product (i.e. Oxygen U.S.P.)
	c) An Air Liquefaction Statement where appropriate
	d) Lot number or other unique identification number
	e) Actual analytical results for full U.S.P. monograph testing.  (A statement 
that only states that the product meets the minimum purity of 99.5%, etc. is not acceptable.)
	f) Test method used to perform the analysis. (A statement such as "Meets
    U.S.P. specifications" is not acceptable; nor would "Tested via    
    Servomex" be acceptable since the specific model number is not  
    provided.) 
g) Signature of authorized supplier representative and date.

7.5  Material Safety Data Sheets shall be provided to the facility COTR upon request.

7.6  A copy of all inspection reports shall be provided to the facility COTR upon the completion of any contractor owned or government owned bulk oxygen system inspections that are required by regulation. 

7.7  All contractor owned equipment shall be maintained or repaired in accordance with NFPA 55 Standard for Bulk Oxygen Systems at Consumer Sites, 2010 and FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) Regulations. 

8.  Applicable Regulations & Standards

NOTE;  Regulations, standards, codes, and certain specifications have not been updated.  Vendor is advised that compliance with all currently applicable regulations, standards, codes, and specifications in effect for the manufacture, delivery, distribution, and supply of medical-grade liquid bulk oxygen is mandatory.  The vendor's quote and proposal shall cite and insure compliance with the most current regulations, standards, codes, and specifications

The following is a list of some of the regulations and standards that are applicable to this contract.  The list is not comprehensive, and the contractor is responsible for ensuring that all products, equipment, and services provided under the contract are in compliance with applicable Federal, state, and local regulations.  If applicable, the editions in effect as of the date of this solicitation are listed.  Contractor is responsible for remaining compliant with any future revisions that are effective at the time of contract performance.

Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 210 & 211 - CGMP regulations for supplying medical grade oxygen.

29 CFR 1910.104    Applies to the installation of bulk oxygen systems on industrial and institutional consumer premises 

49 CFR - Transportation

Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act

NFPA 55: Standard for Bulk Oxygen Systems at Consumer Sites, 2010 Edition

NFPA 99: Standard for Health Care Facilities, 2005 Edition

U.S.P. 23    

Density data and volume measurement equivalents published in Compressed Gas Association Pamphlet No. P-6, titled "Standard Density Data, Atmospheric Gases and Hydrogen," shall be used when necessary to convert measurement of gases from one form to another.  For example, the following conversion factor shall apply for conversion from gallons to cubic feet. 

Calculation based on data in CGA P-6

1 ftÂ³ liquid O2 = 860.6 ftÂ³ gas (Table 1)
1 ftÂ³ liquid O2 = 7.48052 gal ((Table 2)

Therefore:

7.48052 gal (1 ftÂ³) liquid O2 = 860.6 ftÂ³ gas

1 gal liquid O2 = 860.6 ftÂ³ gas
                             7.48052

1 gal liquid O2 = 115.05 ftÂ³ gas 
or more commonly quoted as 1 gal liquid O2 = 115.1 ftÂ³ gas

9.  Contractor Owned Cylinders 

9.1  This section applies to all contractor owned cylinders that are provided under this contract as a back-up system to a primary bulk oxygen system.

9.2  Laws and Regulations:  Cylinders and other containers for gaseous and liquid forms of gases shall comply with the Department of Transportation specifications and shall be maintained, filled, marked, labeled, and shipped to comply with current and subsequent updates to DOT regulations (Title 49-Transportation, Code of Federal Regulations).  Packaging, labeling, etc., for medical gases shall also comply with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. 

9.3  Marking:  In addition to marking required by the aforementioned laws and regulations, marking shall comply with American National Standards Z48.1-1954 (R 1971),  "Method of Marking Portable Compressed Gas Containers to Identify the Material Contained."

9.4  All unauthorized or inapplicable markings, tags, and labels shall be removed. When shipment is by commercial carrier, shipping tags complying with Federal Standard 123F dated 5/15/91 shall be attached to each cylinder so as to be protected by the valve protection cap.  The contract data markings required by the applicable standard shall be applied to one side of the tag and the identification markings on the reverse side.  Consignee markings may be omitted when shipment is by contractor's truck.

9.5  Valves:   Valves shall comply with Compressed Gas Associates Standard CGA-V-1 (11th Edition, 2003), "Standard for Compressed Gas Cylinder Valve Outlet and Inlet Connections."  Valve protection caps for cylinders designed to receive such caps shall be securely attached to the cylinders in a manner to protect the valves from injury during transit and delivery to the purchaser's receiving area.  Refer to 49 CFR 173.301(g)).

9.6  Color Coding:  All cylinders shall be color coded in accordance with the Compressed Gas Association Pamphlet CGA C-9-1988, "Standard Color Marking Of Compressed Gas Containers Intended For Medical Use."

9.7  The contractor shall be responsible for all testing required by regulation of contractor owned cylinders at no additional cost to the Government. 

9.  Contractor Owned Cylinders (continued)

9.9   The contractor's price for the oxygen shall include the furnishing of, at no additional cost, all services which are required at each and every filling of a cylinder to comply with applicable regulations, specifications, and normal good practices.

Solicitation number is HSCG85-10-Q-P30HW8 is issued as a Request for Quotations.

This Request for Quotation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-40. The NAICS Code is 336611. The small business size standard is 1000.

However, other potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities to manufacture these parts to OEM specifications are invited and encouraged to submit proposals. The following information must be provided to evaluate past performance: evidence of past successful manufacture to OEM specifications of all required parts, for the government, OEM, or secondary market, to include evidence of durability and that the parts met normal life cycle expectations without failures.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of F5 Big IP Premium Level Maintenance.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/II owns and has in use F5 Networks Big IP is hardware that provides high-availability load balancing, fast and extremely intelligent layer 7 switching, granular interactive control, DoS protection, resource pooling and a number of other features to help protect our Internet presence with  the following features:	Reliability - Delivers the industry's most proven and advanced system to ensure that applications are always available. 	Accelerated Applications - Provides control to accelerate application performance by up to 3-times, ensures that priority applications are served first, and offloads expensive server cycles.  	Reduced Server and Bandwidth Costs - Triples server capacity through a set of infrastructure optimization capabilities; reduces bandwidth costs by up to 80% through intelligent HTTP compression, bandwidth management and more.<BR><BR>	Greater Network and Application Security - From DoS protection to cloaking to filtering out application attacks, BIG-IP adds critical security features that cannot be addressed elsewhere in the network. 	Application Intelligence and Control - The industry's only solution which delivers complete application fluency - enabling network-speed full payload inspection and programmable event-based traffic management to understand and act upon application flows. 	Total Integration for All IP Applications -- Provides a comprehensive solution that can integrate with all applications, not just Web based protocols.  Provides organizations with a centralized solution for all IP applications, including legacy and emerging applications like VOIP -- all in a single unified system. 	Industry Leading Performance - Delivers the fastest traffic management solution to secure, deliver and optimize application performance. Offers best-in-market SSL TPS, bulk encryption, and the highest concurrent SSL connections available today. CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue to maintain F5 Big IP hardware. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.
Due to CAs investment and overall satisfaction with this hardware, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install other hardware at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use.
CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the F5 Big IP hardware.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular maintenance.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.  According to F5, the only provider of F5 Big IP service is F5.<BR><BR>Line Item Pricing Must Be Broken Out In Order For Seller's Bid To Be Considered For Award. Lapse Service Fees Must Be Included For Each Line Item.<BR><BR>

Background: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office on Women's Health (OWH) is in the process of reviewing the performance and design of its two websites, www.womenshealth.gov and www.girlshealth.gov. The women's health website (then called 4woman.gov) was launched in November 1998. The girl's health website (then called 4girls.gov) was launched in July 2002. In 2009, OWH contracted the performance of a literature review and environmental scan to help OWH gain an understanding of what reliable, science-based, health information is available for its target populations, what the key competition for the www.womenshealth.gov and www.girlshealth.gov website is, and what the pattern of use is for those competitor sites. OWH now seeks to build upon the understanding gained through the literature review and evaluation and gain insight as to what health issues its target audiences are facing, and where they are going to find answers. This will be accomplished through focus groups, and informational interviews. OWH also seeks to gain an understanding of what aspects of womenshealth.gov are functioning well for its target audiences. This will be accomplished through a series of usability testing on the womenshealth.gov website.

Q:   What floor is this tank on (Basement, 1st, 2nd, etc.)?Â  
A:    UD Bldg 1, Basement Floor

Q:   How close can I get our sandblast pot/compressor and vacuum truck to the tank?Â  

A:   Contractor needs to look at job access- VA canâ€™t commit to space needed to maneuver mobile equipment.  Probably not  closer than 100 feet.  

Q:   Is there an outside wall with a door, window, etc. that we could fit  hoses (2â€ for blaster, 8â€ for vac truck) through?  

A:   There is access to the West tankroom through a 8â€™x8â€™ â€œroot cellar doorâ€ at ground level- hoses may be run through this.  No dust can be tolerated during construction- depending on procedures contractor uses, alternate work schedule may be needed.  

Q:   Will there be a forklift available to unload/load our equipment?  
A:   No. Contractor to arrange unloading.

<a href="mailto:lois.greene@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>This amendment provides the responses to questions submitted regarding Solicitation Number VA-48-10-RP-0339 Warehouse Management System (WMS).  Due the clarification of many of the items in Section 2, the Government has decided to extend the closing date to May 21, 2010 @ 2:00PM.   Another amendment shall follow with clarifications to the RFP that will help in the bidding of the solicitation. 

Question 	1.	Will the contractor be required to provide the wooden /plastic pallets during the period of performance?
	Answer: 	No

Question	2.  On the Schedule of services, Specially Line Item 0002 (Warehouse Management System, Receiving, and Picking Services) it lists the unit of issue as 750 pallets. Does the Government require us to price this item as performing these services Monday through Friday throughout the entire period of performance?
Answer: Yes

Question	3.  How often will supplies under Line Item 0002 be delivered, if not daily?
Answer:  Product will only be delivered when it is ordered from the prime vendor.

Question	4.  How often will supplies under Line Item 0002 be received to the contractor's facility?
Answer:  Product will only be delivered when it is ordered from the prime vendor.

Question	5.  Does the Government only anticipate 2 emergency order deliveries throughout the POP?
Answer:  There isn't any way to estimate how many emergencies may be required during the POP.  Therefore, the Government only used two because these supplies were already a cache concerned for emergency purposes.



Question	6.  If the emergency delivery time is 24-48 hours, what is the average lead time for delivery to VA sites?
Answer:  The emergency delivery time is being modified to 24-28, with a lead time for delivery to VA sites of 2 hours.

Question	7.	Where is the warehousing work being performed? The solicitation's SOW addresses an off-site storage facility while your FBO announcement states the following: "Place of Performance: 
ONE OF THE VISN HEALTHCARE FACILITIES;JAMES A HALEY HEALTHCARE FACILITY;VA MEDICAL CENTER;13000 BRUCE B DOWNS BLVD;TAMPA FL 33612 33410 USA 
Answer:    It will be at the contractor's location within the Tampa area.. 

Question 	8.  In Section 1.0 of the SOW, the VA indicates that the contractor is "responsible for the pick-up, storage and distribution of -Medical/Surgical supplies in support of Veteran Integrated Service Network (VISN) 8 Healthcare facilities . "Is the contractor responsible for pick-up at American Medical Supply as well as the VA facilities on an as-need basis?  If so, how many pickups and deliveries per day are anticipated?
Answer: 	No

Question	9.  Does the VA own the inventory being stored?
Answer 	Yes 

Question 	10.  In Schedule B, the VA indicates that: "The Contactor will perform quarterly order stock rotation by pulling orders from the oldest available stock for any order received and replacing it with fresh product from VA inventory. A minimum six months shelf-life is required. "Are orders being placed on a quarterly basis if the stock rotation takes place quarterly? Can you provide the VA ordering procedures (i.e. through IFCAP, through the GIP)? What happens if the VA does not pull orders and the six month shelf life is exceeded? Along those lines, at what time segment does the contractor notify the VA of potentially expiring products? Finally, do the items being stored represent a 30 day supply? 
Answer:	The contractor rotates and pulls orders out of stock.  The contractor monitors stock and pulls items with shelf life that is getting close to six month of expiring.  No, the items stored are not a 30 day-supply, it is a cache supply.

Question	11.	You mentioned that the vendor will have a database to store and maintain the inventory. It is further stated that: "Contractor shall maintain an electronic database of all merchandise stored and cross reference this data with VA IFCAP numbers." Now the IFCAP systems maintains various flavors of control point numbers, whether it be requisition numbers, purchase order number, purchase card order numbers, stock (item) numbers (which should be consistent with the GIP). What IFCAP numbers does the VA expect the contractor to maintain in this database? Also if there's rotating of stock, there may be multiple IFCAP numbers associated with one line number. Wouldn't it be easier for the VA to grant access to the Contractor to its GIP system and identify the contractor's site as a separate "store" (similar to the GIP setup in the VA wards)? The COTR will then have real time access to inventory information at the contractor's facility. 
	Answer:	Due to recent security breaches, the contractor will not be granted access to the medical center's GIP system.  The contractor must have the capability to accept orders from VISN 8 awarded Medical Surgical Prime Vendor via EDI, phone and fax for the VA product maintained within the Warehouse Management System. (WMS).  Due to storage of supplies for several VA healthcare facilities, it is absolutely necessary for the contractor to maintain a separate database of all merchandise stored and cross referenced with VA IFCAP numbers by Facility and the VISN 8 Medical Surgical Prime Vendor item numbers.  Information shall contain stock number, quantities on hand, packaging multiples, vendor information, and cost.

Question	12.	Regarding the SOW: "distribution of -Medical/Surgical supplies in support of Veteran Integrated Service Network (VISN) 8 Healthcare facilities . . ."Will the contractor be responsible for the distribution of supplies to the various wards and stations within a VAMC?  Or will delivery be made to a centralized loading dock at a VAMC and distribution will be the responsibility of the VA Supply Clerks?
Answer  	No

Question	13.	Can you clarify normal business hours: "The Contractor shall provide full access for VA personnel for warehouse inspection during normal business hours (7:00AM - 4:30PM, Monday - Friday)." A normal business day encompasses an eight hour period. Is the VA requiring that the contractor be available over a 9 hour period?
Answer  	No,  8:00AM - 4:30PM, Monday - Friday 

Question	14.	Finally, can you clarify the exact turnaround for an emergency delivery? Schedule B dictates the following: The Contractor shall have the capability of delivering supplies within 24-hour notice 7-days a week on an emergency basis. The Contractor shall deliver specified supplies within 24 -48 hours to any of the requesting VA locations . . ." In the supplemental Word document, the VA dictates the following: " Item 0003 - Delivery of Supplies: The Contractor shall have the capability of delivering supplies 24-hours a day, 7-days a week on an emergency basis. Within a 24-hour notice, the Contractor shall deliver specified supplies within 24 - 48 hours to any of the requesting VA locations . . ."  Is the VA requiring that after the 24 hour notice, the contractor will be responsible for delivery 24-48 hours after the notice (which makes it ultimately up to a 72 hour turnaround)?  Also, there is a significant price difference between a 24 and 48 hour (or a 72 hour) delivery time. Can the VA be more specific as to the required emergency delivery time? Also, since the contractor is on a 24/7 notice, it may behoove the VA to require a 1 hour telephone response and a next business day delivery for emergency orders.
Answer	The emergency delivery time is being modified to 24-28 hours, with a lead time for delivery to VA sites of 2 hours.

Question 	15.  Reference to the RFP in that the temperature can be no higher than 72 degrees.  This really limits or eliminates a lot of good providers.  Can you provide clarification?
Answer	Merchandise will be stored in a temperature controlled environment at industry standards for medical surgical products to ensure product efficacy for shelf-lift is not compromised.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW), SBSS F/O Program Office, intends to release a solicitation to acquire a second SBSS satellite that is integrated with the existing SBSS Block 10 ground system infrastructure, in order to ensure continuity of service for the space situational awareness (SSA) space tier. SBSS F/O is an Acquisition Category ID program. The NAICS code for this announcement is 336414 with the applicable size standard of 1,000 personnel.
<p>The objective of SBSS F/O is to deliver space surveillance capabilities to address the SSA needs of the warfighter. The SBSS F/O mission is to collect metric position and Space Object Identification data on manmade Resident Space Objects. SBSS F/O will operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to serve users who require SSA of deep-space and near-earth resident objects. SBSS F/O will be part of a "Family of Systems", interoperable with existing systems, and enhancing the global reach of command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence for Air Force Space Control. The F/O capability will be fielded to mitigate the end of life of the SBSS Block 10 satellite, and the acquisition will be based on existing Block 10 requirements with an expected award in 2nd qtr FY11 and anticipated launch by early 1st qtr FY15. This contract will also include options for interim contractor support, transition support, special studies, and sustainment for up to five years. Proposal instructions and timelines will be communicated via the Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>

Each Prime Contractor will be limited to six attendees. Each person attending must have a current TS/SSBI with DCID 6/4 eligibility and be briefed SI/TK that can be validated via the joint personnel adjudication system (JPAS). If JPAS verification cannot be provided, then verification of sensitive compartmented information access from other agencies will be accepted. A Prime Contractor will submit for each person a Personnel Access Request (PAR), Special Access Program (SAP) Format 1, a SF86 that is signed/dated within the last year, a JPAS printout and evidence of a local records check in the last year. If a person is currently accessed to an Air Force SAP sponsored by SYSW, the SF86 is current within the last year and the local records check was accomplished within the last year, then only a PAR with JPAS printout is required. In all cases, the justification for SAP access is "To participate in SBSS Follow-On Industry Day". Anyone not meeting Tier 1 standards will not be allowed to participate in industry discussions.</p>
<p>As stated above, each Prime Contractor must have a SCIF that is either currently accredited by SYSW or must provide documentation showing the Prime Contractor has a currently accredited SCIF sponsored by another agency. Further, Prime Contractors must identify via a one or two page concept of operations, how they will store/process and segregate SBSS Follow-On information, what building/rooms will be used and, if applicable, identify the sponsor of your SCIF who will approve processing and storage of SBSS material in their sponsored facility.</p>
<p>Potential Prime Contractors invited to the industry discussions will receive separate instruction via the invitation to attend identifying the POC for submission of SAP Format 1 PARs and facility documentation.</p>
<p>BIDDERS LIBRARY<br />The RFP and attachments along with any subsequent document releases will be attached and posted under this GPE, https://www.fbo.gov/.</p>

The government anticipates to negotiate and award multiple Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts as a result from this solicitation. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does it restrict the government in any way to an ultimate acquisition approach. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.</p>
<p>Detailed information on this acquisition was previously posted at www.fedbizopps.gov as solicitation FA7046-10-R-0001 and FA7046-09-R-0003.

This office will not issue hard copies of the solicitation, attachments, or technical documents. Award will be made on a best-value basis; price and other factors are being considered.</p>

<p>Potential offerors must have current security clearances at the classification level as specified in the DD Form 254 and must show the ability to provide security levels up to Special Access Program (SAP).</p>
<p>Due to the potential for decreased task order competition after award, cross-teaming is prohibited. The intent of this prohibition is to create pure, distinct, separable teams that remain as such during the life of this contract.</p>
<p>All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, Required Central Contract Registration, that lack of registration in the CCR database with a CAGE code BY 15 July 2010 will make an offeror ineligible for award.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice/solicitation is to competitively issue an undetermined number of Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) for various types of Multi Trade Construction projects to include design to build construction at Aviano and Ghedi Air Bases, Italy.
<p>The proposed Basic Ordering Agreement is included in this notice.<br />A basic ordering agreement is not a contract.<br />Each order issued shall be subject to the contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, conditions and pricing of the BOA.</p>
<p>Firms issued a BOA may receive requests for technical and/or price proposals leading to award of orders. Issuance of Basic Ordering Agreements will be based on evaluation of qualifications in accordance with the criteria as set forth below. Award of specific orders as requirements arise will be based on price and other factors as deemed desirable and set forth for each specific requirement. Specific Firm Fixed Price orders will be competed among those firms issued a BOA. The Government, in its sole discretion, will determine which, and how many, of the firms holding BOA's will be requested to submit price and technical proposals for requirements leading to Firm Fixed Price orders. The approximate range in value of orders is expected to be $650.00 to $1,500,000.00 (Euro 500.00 to Euro 1,160,550.00). The foreseen average number of orders per year is 19 for an approximate aggregate value range between $8 million and $15 million (Euro 7,737,000.00 and Euro 11,605,000.00). The majority of projects have been for vertical multi trade construction efforts.</p>
<p>Under this Multi Trade Construction program, firms selected for a BOA will compete on task orders for requirements. If adequate competition cannot be obtained, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition to include non BOA holders. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement.<br />Government funds are obligated only to the extent that a duly issued order creates such obligation.</p>
<p>Pricing: In order to provide maximum flexibility for market conditions, economies of scale and quantity considerations and other price driving factors, firms will be required to submit Not to Exceed coefficients for each year of the anticipated 5 year duration of the BOA. Each order under the BOA shall be on a Firm Fixed Price basis. The order proposal cannot be based on prices that exceed the ceiling coefficient for the applicable period.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program through the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov) for new entrants once a year or at intervals that will guarantee adequate competition for this specific Multi Trade Construction program. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued under the BOA. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification. A BOA may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation. Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the 31st Contracting squadron may continue to place orders under the BOA.</p>
<p>Firms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will be considered for issuance of a BOA. Approximately five (5) BOA's will be issued to the most qualified firms for each of the classifications listed below. Firms selected for each classification may participate in order solicitations at or below their classification level, but not for higher classifications. Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and each firm will be determined to be either eligible or ineligible.</p>
<p>To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm must submit the coefficient pricing schedule, list of references and documents that meet all the following minimum criteria for each SOA classification:(NOTE: For Items 1, 2, 3, and 4, European Common Market firms established outside of the Republic of Italy shall present their Government's corresponding documents with an English translation of each document1.

<DESC>The Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, intends to award a sole source procurement with the Energy Center of Wisconsin, Inc. for USGBC Certified Green Building LEED training services. The contractor will serve as a subject matter expert on various Green Building training topics. This training will allow for LEED professionals to maintain credentials as required.
<p>Pursuant to the accreditation approval toward Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Professional Credential Maintenance, the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) requires that vendors off programs that have been peer-reviewed and approved by the USGBC. As an organization recognized by the Green Building Certification Institute as being an Education Review Body, USGBC is able to ensure that approved third-party education provider courses meet the highest standards, thus guaranteeing LEED professionals a green building education that will help in maintaining credentials.</p>
<p>The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. The applicable NAICS code is 541712.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Any parties interested in this award should submit their response, with proof of ability to provide the service no later that May 21, 2010. Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC><br />This is a Notice of Award posted in accordance with FAR subpart 5.7, Publicizing Requirements under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The award is made in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b), for a purchase of services not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. The contracting officer has determined that exigencies of the situation warrant such an award; the contractor was already in place servicing the customer under the same contract at the same post location; and the time frame for the additional guard did not allow for a full and open competition nor that it was in the best interest of the Government to have two separate contracts for the same post location at the same time. Award was made on May 14, 2010.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>The overarching objective is to advance new knowledge that will support comprehensive strategies for managing releases of chlorinated solvents and other persistent contaminations in ground water in unconsolidated sediments.  The vision is that comprehensive strategies that consider all compartments containing chlorinated solvents, including those in low permeability zones, will lead to improved decisions, better use of DoD resources, a healthier environment, and the opportunity for the DoD to focus more fully on its primary missions.

MODIFICATION TO
FOREST SERVICE CONTRACT AG-7604-C-07-0025
E-GOVERNMENT/ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE
MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT
Washington Office AQM IT Branch 


1.  Nature/Description of Action. 

The FS Electronic Government program was chartered by the FS Executive Leadership Team (ELT) in 2001 in response to a Presidential mandate (commonly referred to as The President’s Management Agenda).  The Electronic Government Act of 2002 elevated the mandate to law, re-emphasizing the federal government’s commitment to delivering services to citizens electronically.  

The Forest Service’s investment in electronic government has correspondingly grown over the years and is now in the range of $30-$40 million a year.  In addition to the electronic government mandates, federal agencies have been required to develop and maintain Enterprise Architecture (EA) programs since the enactment of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. Emphasis on this program, particularly from OMB, has increased steadily to the point where demonstrating EA compliance and proficiency is becoming an IT budget determinant for federal agencies.

The FS led efforts for the Electronic Government and Enterprise Architecture programs are dependent on specialized expertise in a great many technical and business analysis domains.  Personnel having these skills are not yet found to any significant degree in the federal work force.  As a consequence, agencies are critically dependent on acquiring this expertise through contracting.  The Electronic Government - Enterprise Architecture Technical and Management Services Contract (e-Gov Contract) is the vehicle by which the Forest Service implements projects that are transforming the way the FS does business in the Electronic Age.  

This justification seeks approval for the following modifications to Forest Service contract AG-7604-C-07-0025 issued to Innovative Solutions Group, Inc. (ISG).

a.	Increasing the contract ceiling from $60M to $90M for work within scope

The incumbent contractor, Innovative Solutions Group (ISG), is a certified Vietnam Era Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB).  The company recently applied for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) certification.  Their current contract performance is excellent.

2.	Description of Supplies/Services. 

This contract provides the Forest Service with a vehicle for fast and effective access to State-of-the-Art business analysis, technical analysis, software development, and enterprise architecture services to support the Forest Service electronic Government (e-Government) and Enterprise Architecture (EA) initiatives.  

The contract requires the contractor to supply all personnel and resources necessary to provide the Forest Service with management and technical support services for both the e-Government and EA programs. The contractor has performed the following work through task orders issued under aforementioned contract. 

a.	Recreation One Stop (R1S), Recreation Information Data Base (RIDB).
b.	Field Data Automation/Mobile Computing
c.	Weather Information Management System (WIMS) Support Fire and
      Aviation Management (F&AM)
d.	Enterprise Content Management & Office of Regulatory and Management Services (ORMS) Modernization
e.	Electronic Research
f.	Web Information Delivery (FS web internet and intranet web portals)
g.	National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Portal Support
h.	e-Commerce/e-Collections Support for Symbols.gov
i.	Enterprise Architecture Office Support
j.	USDA/FS Enterprise Architecture Repository Support
k.	Electronic Forms (including Government Paperwork Elimination Act
     [GPEA] compliance)
l.	Information Resource (IR) Governance (Capital Planning & Investment Control (CPIC), Earned Value Management (EVM), & EA)
m.	Streamlining Permitting
n.	Business Requirements Management and Information Management
o.	Electronic Management of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Projects (eMNEPA)
p.	FS Compliance with USDA eAuthentication 
q.	Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) Support
r.	FS Applications Architecture
s.	FS Data Center Operations
t.	Operate Program Management Office.

This contract has also served as a vehicle for the FS to rapidly engage the services of specific Subject Matter Experts (SME) as well as to quickly start and complete small highly visible projects such as Customer Feedback, People & Places, Information Security and the FS Strategic IR Framework that would have required significantly longer timeframes for implementation if they were contracted out individually.     

This contract was solicited on September 07, 2005, as a competitively-awarded 8(a) set-aside Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with provisions for firm, fixed-price or time and material task order pricing.  The contract was for a base period of two (2) years and three (3) one-year options with a ceiling of $12 million per year over the period of performance of the contract.  

The contract was awarded on May 1, 2006 with an initial ceiling of $24 million.  In February 2008 USDA issued a Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA-08-004) for this contract that allowed the FS to raise the ceiling to the amount contemplated in the solicitation of $60 million. The current contract period of performance is through May 1, 2010.  One 1-year option period remains under the current contract; however, no contract ceiling remains for either additional task orders or additional work within scope under existing task orders.  The contractor has up to one year after contract expiration to deliver on any work not completed prior to this expiration.  To date the FS has obligated approximately $60 million to the contract over a 4-year period.  It is estimated that an additional $30 million (beyond the current $60 million ceiling) is required to meet the proposed 1-year remaining for the period of performance. This would yield a total ceiling price of $90 Million.  The estimates for upcoming tasks in the following table reflect the program’s best estimate of what will be required to perform work during the increased period of performance:


Fiscal Year	Actual Funds
Obligated
 2006	$13.2M
2007	11.3M
2008	14.2M
2009	16.5M
2010	$4.8M
Total	$60.0M

Fiscal Year	Estimated Funds
2010	     $12.0M
2011	       18.0M
Total Estimated	     $30.0M   
Total Obligated	     $60.0M

Projected Total
Ceiling	   
  $90.0M




3.  Statutory Authority for Raising the Contract Ceiling and extending the period of performance.

The statutory authority for the action proposed in this justification includes the following:

41 USC 253(c)(1) and FAR Subpart 6.302-1 Only one responsible source, including FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) Follow-on contracts and FAR Subpart 6.302-1(b)(1) Unique capabilities:  The services required by the FS are available, for the extension period discussed (i.e., prior to when a recompeted contract could be awarded), from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy FS requirements.

4.  Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications and nature of the acquisition that requires use of the cited authority.  ISG’s unique qualifications applicable to statutory authority 41 USC 253(c)(1) and FAR Subpart 6.302-1 “Only one responsible source” are as follows:

a.	FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) Follow-on Contract.  The funding for the subject contract represents a sizeable investment in the present contractor team for the FS e-Government and EA programs.  Significant work remains to be completed.  Awarding one or more short term new contracts to continue ongoing work while efforts unfold to award a new competitive contract represents a substantial risk to the FS in terms of: a) duplicate effort to get a new contractor up to speed on applications currently under development, b) getting current work completed in the time required, and c) loss of subject matter expertise for existing tasks and agency-specific knowledge. There is not a reasonable expectation that these kinds of losses could be recovered by the FS through competition of the work that would be accomplished by contract modification to the subject contract.

Existing task orders under current contract have resulted in reaching the contract ceiling.  Funding for the current task orders is expected to be expended by the end of March 2010.  If the ceiling is not raised the contractor support for a significant number of mission critical projects will have to stop until such time as a replacement contract is put in place or contractor services for individual projects are obtained through alternative contract vehicles such as negotiating sole source contracts with certified 8(a) minority owned small businesses.  

It is quite possible that the replacement contract effort for the entire requirement could take up to one year to complete and would thus leave a significant gap in FS EA e-Gov contractor support.   Negotiating alternative sole source contract vehicles for individual projects could take three months or more to complete, especially if six or more contracts are to be issued to meet the full range of services required.  Competitive, individual, short term, replacement contracts would take even longer because of the time necessary to conduct a competition for each portion of the e-Gov contract currently in place.  Any of these alternatives add significant workload to an already understaffed agency staff.  In addition, a gap in the contracting support for many critical projects would occur and result in the FS losing a sizeable amount of intellectual capital, workforce momentum, and key contractor personnel.  Additional detail concerning these losses is provided in part c. below.

b.	FAR Subpart 6.302-1(b)(1) Unique Capabilities.  ISG created a consortium of small companies with unique experience and expertise relative to the FS’s e-Government and EA programs.  ISG has also brought additional small businesses on board as the need has arisen.  ISG has subcontracted to a total of thirty-four (34) other small businesses. The list of the thirty-four (34) small businesses and consulting firms that ISG has subcontracted to over the last three years is contained in attachment A.  Since contract inception, almost four years ago, ISG developed unique FS e-Gov knowledge and expertise as the incumbent contractor.  It is estimated that it would take 12 months or more for another contractor to gain the overall knowledge and expertise that ISG currently has on this FS e-Gov contract.  Because of this unique partnership it could take up to six separate contracts with various companies to meet the single contract under ISG currently. 

c.	Rationale for Contract Ceiling Increase 

1.	The Enterprise Architecture and Electronic Government work has matured, in the last 3-3/4 years, from experimental innovation to a proven methodology to dramatically improve the effectiveness and efficiency of agency business processes.  The success stories from these efforts are starting to get wide spread exposure and discussion, in part because Communication of proven Business Solution development successes is a step in the methodology.  The result of this spread of the success stories is a steady increase in requests for Business Analysis and Enterprise Architecture contractor support from efforts all around the agency; efforts that are striving to drive out costs, increase outputs, and improve outcomes achieved by, unit and staff business processes. This amount of very legitimate business need for using the EA eGov contract was not foreseen when the contract was initially put together.

2.	The initial contract anticipated a small amount of use by other USDA agencies partnering with the FS.  This past fiscal year (2009) that anticipation underwent an almost $3 million dollar expansion, in part, as USDA OCIO adopted key aspects of the FS EA approach and thus found the FS EA contractors as the obvious source for their support needs.  The major factor in USDA use of the contract resulted from the FS success with the USDA mandated Web Portal implementation which caught the attention of the NRCS Office of Communications.  NRCS leadership subsequently approved a $6 million, 3-year effort to "clone" the FS Web Portal framework and "reuse" a great many of the Portal components developed and perfected in the FS efforts.  The obvious contractor support option for the NRCS effort was the FS Portal contractor team.  Word of the FS success and the NRCS collaboration with FS on the Web Portal implementation is fast getting around to other agencies in the Department and can be expected to generate additional demand for use of the FS contract.  These kinds of developments were not at all foreseen in the establishment of the initial contract ceiling and are now expected to account for up to $4 to $5 million a year.  The amount of annual increase is being limited to the $8 million/yr because that is the most the current FS EA eGov staff (permanent federal employees) can adequately manage.  Both sources of change described above have potential to grow fast enough that the $8 million/yr will leave unmet demand.  The hard constraint for meeting that demand will be lack of federal staff.  These supply vs. demand factors will be addressed as the FS CIO plans the follow-on contracting strategy and vehicle.

5.  Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.  Not applicable.  
6. The contracting officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  This is based on the competitive and historical pricing data obtained.
7.  The market research conducted and results.  Adequate competition was received initially.  Despite the recent economic down-turn there is no indication that resolicitation would result in lower prices to the Government for these services.  Market research was based on initial offers received and then informally validated based on experience of the current acquisition team with pricing for similar professional services.
8.  Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.  The estimated cost to the Government might sustain if the contract must be recompeted in lieu of increasing the existing contract ceiling is $50 million of loss to applications under development but not yet completed.  This estimate was developed by the e-Gov Program managers and based on experience with the tasks that are underway for the program. The estimate of the loss due to degraded fire support should the Weather Information Management System (WIMS) alone lose contractor support could resulting in potential loss of life and near certain loss of property is at least $100 million.  This estimate is quite conservative as: a) loss of life is not something to be measured in dollars, and b) in the wildland urban interface, credible estimation techniques value a single acre lost to wildfire in the neighborhood of $1 million dollars.
9. Listing of the sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.  Not applicable.
10. Actions the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. Efforts to recompete the contract were initiated in late spring 2009 but existing workload for the CIO has caused these efforts to proceed slower than expected.  This requirement will be competed in the future as it was in the past.  A recompetition will be conducted with a competitive award in time to allow for sufficient transition of ongoing work to a new contractor.
