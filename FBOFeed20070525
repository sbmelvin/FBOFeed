<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is soliciting proposals is for a project that is part of AHRQ?s new Joining Forces initiative which aims to capitalize on the joint power of administrative data and health IT to support quality improvement, health care transparency and research.  Through two complementary contract solicitations issued simultaneously, AHRQ will support projects to add more detailed clinical data to statewide administrative databases.  These projects build on recent work sponsored by AHRQ that assessed the incremental value of adding particular clinical data elements.  In the first project an in-depth pilot will be conducted in one or more states to add or link hospital clinical information to administrative (discharge abstract or claims) data.  In the second project, a limited number of smaller planning awards will be provided to statewide data organizations that are not yet ready to engage in a pilot but that seek to enhance their administrative datasets with more clinical data.  This solicitation is for the first type of project? to provide support to pilot efforts to enhance statewide all-payer hospital administrative data by adding more clinical information. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code that best describes the requirement is 541611.  The small business size standard is $6.5 million (provided for information only, as this procurement is advertised on a limited competition among qualified offerors basis). These two types of projects (pilot projects and planning projects) will focus on expanding the data capacities of statewide data organizations participating in HCUP and is therefore open to any HCUP Partner that meets the qualifications stated herein.  To be eligible the HCUP partner must meet or exceed the following criteria: The organization must provide statewide inpatient data to AHRQ, and in many cases provide ambulatory surgery and emergency department data as well. If any HCUP partners that individually are unable to meet this requirement are encouraged to partner with subcontractors, as appropriate, to accomplish their proposed project.  These data are used to build a family of HCUP databases for national, state, regional and local analyses.  Improving the clinical robustness of HCUP Partner data will enable the statewide data organizations to produce more accurate and expanded quality assessments of hospitals in their state.  It will also improve the HCUP databases to which these Partners contribute, thus enhancing the accuracy and comprehensiveness of quality assessment at the state and national levels (e.g. as reported in the National Healthcare Quality Report).  Enhanced clinical data in HCUP databases will also support more robust analyses that provide the evidence base for quality improvement efforts. 
AHRQ may award more than one contract from this solicitation.  If multiple awards are made, each Contractor will work independently on their projects.  Each awardee will also participate in peer-to-peer learning forums with other pilot project and planning project contractors to exchange knowledge and lessons learned.  Under separate AHRQ sponsorship, the HCUP contractor and its subcontractors with expertise in administrative data, health IT, and data exchange, will serve a convening and technical assistance role for the peer-to-peer learning process.  The HCUP contractor will also synthesize findings from the final reports of all pilot project and planning project contractors to create a report that AHRQ will disseminate to other statewide data organizations on the lessons learned from these projects.
In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQ?s site at http://ahrq.gov . Once in AHRQ?s homepage go to ?Funding Opportunities?, then to ?Contracts?, and then to ?Request for Proposal (RFP)?. It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and to monitor this site for any subsequent amendments. It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on/about June 1, 2007 with proposals due July 2, 2007.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 07-37 C-Sniper CLOSING DATE: One year from the date of publication in www.fbo.gov; PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS DUE: 4:00 p.m., Arlington, VA local time, 9 July 2007.  POC: Dr. Deepak Varshneya, Program Manager, DARPA/STO; Email: BAA07-37@darpa.mil; 
Website: http://www.darpa.mil/sto/solicitations/c-sniper/index.html

This BAA plus the associated Proposer's Information Pamphlet (PIP) and its classified addendum together constitute the full BAA for this project.  The Proposers are advised to obtain the associated PIP and its classified addendum with BAA 07-37 and follow the details of submission set forth in the PIP.

C-SNIPER PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) is soliciting proposals under the BAA07-37 entitled C-Sniper for the detection and neutralization of enemy snipers before they can engage with US Forces. The program will be executed in two Phases leading to delivery of a field testable prototype suitable for operational experimentation as an integrated part of the DARPA Crosshairs system.  The Crosshairs system is already under development at Mustang Technologies, Allen, TX.  The purpose of the Crosshairs is to detect enemy bullets, RPGs, and mortars fired at our vehicles and to prevent them from striking the vehicle.  C-Sniper will augment this capability by identifying threats before they can fire. The C-Sniper will be integrated with DARPA's Crosshairs system in Phase 2 of the program.

The enemy snipers may be operating both with, and without telescopic sights, and other optical systems in high cluttered urban environments. The C-Sniper system will operate day and night from a moving military vehicle and provide the operator with sufficient information to make a timely engagement decision. Once the decision is made, the C-Sniper will provide data and control to point and track the on-board weapon (provided in DARPA's Crosshairs system) on the selected target. The final decision to fire the weapon will be left to the operator as required per the rules of engagement.  During operation, the C-Sniper must be eye safe for personnel on the vehicle and near the vehicle.  

There are many significant technical challenges to overcome to make this into an operational combat system.  These may include as a minimum but not limited to the following: 

1)	Detect enemy snipers carrying weapons before they fire a shot.  Key objective is to determine where the shot may come from rather than where it came from;
2)	Develop techniques to reject clutter and maximize probability of correctly detecting and locating the target; 
3)	Reduce system design complexity minimizing moving parts while maximizing robustness; 
4)	Integrate C-Sniper with DARPA's Crosshairs on military vehicles.

With these challenges as a guide, DARPA is seeking proposal for the entire system to be executed in two phases.  The objectives of these phases are summarized below:

Phase 1 (Base) Objective: Phase 1 will develop the key technologies and interfaces, culminating in a fully functional proof-of-concept system. The proof-of-concept system will be tested to demonstrate C-Sniper functionality in an urban and rural environment, on a stationary vehicle, progressing toward the program technical challenges as measured by phase 1 program metrics of the C-Sniper provided in the Classified PIP Addendum.  A development path must be shown that leads C-Sniper integration into the Crosshairs.

Phase 2 (Option 1) Objective: In Phase 2 Option 1, the performer will develop, deliver and demonstrate the operation of C-Sniper on moving military vehicles using a field testable prototype suitable for operational experimentation. In this phase, the prototype will demonstrate continued progress towards the program technical challenges as measured by phase 2 program metrics of the C-Sniper provided in the Classified PIP Addendum.  Testing will also be conducted when C-Sniper is integrated with Crosshairs. The prototype system will be tested on moving vehicles in a high-clutter field environment with numerous targets and false targets while showing operation in conjunction with Crosshairs. 

SECURITY:  The Government will execute the C-Sniper program as classified.  Proposals submitted under this BAA may be classified.  Guidance regarding the marking, packaging, and delivery of classified proposals is provided in the Proposers Information Pamphlet (PIP) associated with this BAA.  A TOP SECRET facility clearance and a TOP SECRET safeguarding clearance will be required to perform awards issued under this BAA.  Organizations that do not have both of these clearances may still perform under this BAA by teaming with an organization that does if the organization does not receive or generate classified material.

NOTE:  Do not contact the contracting officer or the Program Manager identified below with respect to this announcement.  All questions should be sent to BAA07-37@darpa.mil.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office intend to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the acquisition of technical support services.  The Contractor shall provide all necessary personnel, material, and services to provide technical support and new technology development studies for the for the Cross Track Infrared Sounder (CrIS)/Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) Pre-Launch Instrument Assessment and Attainment Activities conducted by the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Services (NESDIS) for its National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS).   This acquisition will be conducted on an unrestricted basis utilizing the procedures outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15.   The North America Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 541710 with a Size Standard of 500 employees. 

NPOESS is a satellite system used to monitor global environmental conditions, and collect and disseminate data related to: weather, atmosphere, oceans, land and the near-space environment. The NPOESS Integrated Program Office (IPO) organizationally resides within the Department of Commerce, NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS). The Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), created the IPO to develop, acquire, manage, and operate the NPOESS satellites. Details on NPOESS can be found at http://npoess.noaa.gov. The NPOESS requirements were developed by the user community and are captured in the NPOESS Integrated Operational Requirements Document (IORD). To achieve its mission, the IPO has undertaken a far-reaching program of sensor development, and satellite transition and evolution to provide complete coverage of environmental conditions for civil, military, and scientific purposes. NPOESS data will be processed into Environmental Data Records (EDRs) for use by a number of operational communities. The IPO?s operational effectiveness depends on its ability to keep pace with rapidly developing technologies. To accomplish this, the IPO researches and develops initiatives through its Internal Government Studies (IGS) program. The IGS program consists of teams of scientists and engineers from Government laboratories and centers, Federally-Funded Research and Development Centers, universities, and industry. These teams are tasked to identify and test technologies and techniques that are able to meet NPOESS requirements and objectives. 

This acquisition will support the following areas of study: (1) Independent evaluation of algorithms producing Sensor Data Records (SDRs) and EDRs for the CrIS and ATMS instruments (2) Pre-Launch instrument characterization of the CrIS sensor, including rapid independent analysis of sensor test data and performance impact studies (3) Preparation for and execution of post-launch calibration and validation of CrIS and ATMS data products, leveraging experience with calibration and validation of heritage instruments with available proxy data from similar instruments, such as the currently European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), and (4) Development of independent truth data sets for post-launch calibration and validation of the NPOESS SDRs and EDRs.

The Government anticipates the award of a cost reimbursement contract. The resultant contract shall be for a period of one year commencing on or about September 1, 2007 and will include four 12-month option periods.  The solicitation for this acquisition will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunity website, www.fedbizopps.gov, on or about 15 days from the date of this notice.  All future information regarding this acquisition, including amendments, will be distributed solely through this website.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be available.  Interested firms are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any) and monitoring the website to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition.  All evaluation factors will be outlined in the solicitation.  Technical evaluation factors (i.e., technical approach. past performance, and staffing plan/personnel) are significantly more important than price.    

All responsible sources registered with the Central Contractor?s Registration (CCR) at http://www/ccr.gov may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Proposal/offers shall be submitted in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the solicitation document.    All questions resulting from this notice or the subsequent solicitation document must be submitted in writing via email to Rubie.B.King@noaa.gov.

<DESC>The Administration for Children and Families through the Program Support Center, Strategic Acquisition Service, Division of Acquisition Management has a requirement for a contractor to manage and administer a large-scale, early childhood data collection and analysis efforts for the Descriptive Study of Early Head Start.  The Descriptive Study of Early Head Start will provide data from a nationally representative sample of programs that will address the following goals:

?	Gaining information on what Early Head Start is: As a new initiative that rapidly expanded in its first 10 years, little is know nationally about key features of the programs beyond what is learned from the PIR and the recently completed Survey of Early Head Start Programs.  More in-depth information on implementation of the HSPPS as well as specific services delivered to families is needed.  
?	Gaining information on who is being served by Early Head Start: What are the needs of families who enter Early Head Start?  What needs develop over time while they are in the program? What challenges do families encounter over the first three years of their children?s lives? 
?	Gaining more information on children served by Early Head Start: How are children faring over time?  
?	Gaining more information on how programs individualize services and referrals to meet the needs of families, and exploring how child and family outcomes are associated with specific services received over time. 

In addition to providing information to support program planning, technical assistance and research at the national level, this study will also provide guidance and context for individual programs in the selection of outcomes and measures for their own performance measurement. 

 Core tasks for the contract will include:  (1) Establishment of a Technical Work Group (TWG) whose members will advise the Contractor on various technical aspects of the study; (2) Development of a sampling plan that draws on the universe of regular Early Head Start programs; (3) Negotiation with approximately between 60 and 80 local programs to facilitate engagement in the study; (4) Selection and/or development of a battery of research-based, valid and reliable data collection instruments including: survey instruments for program assessment as well as in-person interviews with Early Head Start parents, teachers, and staff; tools for the direct assessment of infants and toddlers; and observational measures of classroom environments and home visits.  Negotiation of agreements with publishers of any copyrighted assessments selected for use in the Descriptive Study of Early Head Start and compensation of publishers for such rights may be required; (5) Development of materials necessary to obtain OMB approval for data collection activities; (6) Development of a detailed data collection and analysis plan; (7) On-site data collection including direct annual assessments of children; parent and teacher interviews for each child; and observations in the programs.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with the University of Toledo, 3000 Arlington Avenue, Toledo, OH 43614 for a project entitled ?Marinobufagenin as a target for DIGIBIND in preeclampsia?.   The vendor will aim to demonstrate that in hypertensive patients with ESRD, DIGIBIND, due to blockade of MBG, lowers blood pressure and reduces systemic oxidant stress.  This trial will provide basis for the development of a ?clinically-usable? anti-MBG antibody.  Specific aims of the study are: 1) to quantify changes in the levels of blood pressure following 2 weeks of one-a-week administration of three does of DIGIBIND (0.1mg/kg; 0.4 mg/kg, and 1.6 mg/kg); 2) to quantify changes in the leels of blood pressure following 2 weeks of once-a-week administration of three doses of DIGIBIND (0.1mg/kg; 0.4 mg/kg; and 1.6mg/kg).  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C.  253 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1).  The cited authority is applicable because the University of Toledo is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract after a market search was performed.  The period of performance is 12 months.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 541990 and the size standard is $6.5 million.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt for the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.

<DESC>RURAL HOSPITAL PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT 
The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is soliciting to obtain the services to support methods of improving access to quality health care services in the area defined as the Mississippi Delta, by the Delta Regional Authority, through efforts to improve the financial, operational and clinical performance of their rural hospitals with comprehensive and ongoing technical assistance. The target area includes 240 counties/parishes in the following eight states: Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee. The proposed acquisition listed herein is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside The NAICS code is 5416181 with a size standard of 6.0 million dollars.  The Office of Rural Health Policy (ORHP) was established by the Administration in August 1987, subsequently authorized by Congress in December 1987 and located within the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).  ORHP is charged in Section 711 of the Social Security Act with advising the Secretary of DHHS on the effects of current policies and proposed statutory, regulatory, administrative and budgetary changes in the programs established under Titles XVIII and XIX, the financial viability of small rural hospitals and other health care providers, the ability of rural areas (rural hospitals in particular) to attract and retain physicians, including other health professionals and access to (and the quality of) health care in rural areas.  ORHP
is mandated to oversee compliance with the requirements of section 1102(b) of the Act and section 4083 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987.  It is mandated to establish and maintain a clearinghouse for collecting and disseminating information on rural health care issues, research findings relating to rural health care and innovative approaches to the delivery of health care in rural areas.  ORHP is charged with coordinating rural health activities within the Department, with particular attention to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and its programs.  This will also include related activities of other Federal agencies such as the Veterans Administration, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  ORHP is to also work with States, State hospital associations, private associations, foundations and other organizations to find solutions to rural health care delivery problems.  These problems include but are not limited to shortages of health care providers and an aging and financially fragile health services delivery infrastructure.  The goal of the Rural Hospital Performance Improvement Project (RHPI) is to make accessible a portfolio of expert support services, business tools, and technical advice that is similar to those available to larger, urban hospitals for the sake of improving the viability of eligible hospitals. This project will provide on-site technical assistance to hospitals identified as being eligible to participate in effort to help them improve their financial, clinical and operational performance. Additionally, the project will (1) collect and disseminate business tools, information and data bases that hospitals can use to help themselves and (2) help build state and regional capacity that can continue to provide ongoing technical assistance to rural hospitals throughout the Delta.  This project will also include the introduction and implementation of performance management tools and methodologies for safety net providers.  Safety net providers have a mandate to provide health care to uninsured, Medicaid, and other vulnerable patients regardless of their ability to pay.  That mandate necessitates efficient operations of rural hospitals charged with being safety net providers.  The application of performance management tools and methodologies can assist in insuring the hospitals viability and in the maintenance of the safety net provider role for the community.  Many of the tools offer relatively simple management solutions that will enable the facilities and their boards of directors to take a comprehensive approach to their key strategies and ensure attention to the most critical areas of hospitals operations.  Additionally, performance management activities include educating hospitals staff on how to collect, analyze and use data to make decisions.  Effort should be made to educate local constituents, consultants and state health organization staff on how the adoption of the performance management activities affects the facility and their service area.  The Delta RHPI Project will work collaboratively with the Delta States Rural Development Network (DSRDN) Program, both of which comprise the Delta States Initiative that is supported by the Office of Rural Health Policy, HRSA, DHHS.  Additionally, the project will strive to forge relationships between the State Offices of Rural Health, State Hospital Associations, Quality Improvement Organizations and the eligible/participating hospitals.  The anticipated period of performance is for a twelve (12) month base year with four 12 month option years.   This is a pre-solicitation notice and not a request for proposals. The solicitation document (RFP) will be posted at this site www.fedbizopps.gov approximately fifteen (15) days of this notice and can be downloaded by looking under the main menu for HHS/Office-Health Resources and Services Administration/locations-Division of Procurement Management. The closing date for receipt of proposals will be approximately thirty (30) days after issuance/posting of the RFP. It shall be the offeror?s responsibility to monitor this website for the RFP and any amendments to the RFP. The agency will consider proposals from all responsible sources.

It is a requirement of the contract that an HIV Vaccine Team advances the vaccine concept(s) along a well-defined development path in a timely manner to a vaccine product and into clinical testing by the beginning of the fifth year of the award period. Offerors are strongly encouraged, but not required, to conduct phase I/II trials in collaboration with an NIAID/DAIDS-supported clinical trials network, the HIV/AIDS Vaccine Trials Network (the HVTN; http://www.hvtn.org/ ).

It is anticipated that one to two (2) cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a period of up to seven (7) years for the base period beginning approximately June 27, 2008.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Prospective contractors must be registered in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract.  Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements may be obtained by calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the Internet at http:/ /www.bpn.gov.

With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representations and certification information, via the Internet  at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>The source selection just heard back from the Pentagon and while we have nothing formal; we understand the meeting with OUSD/AT&L happened yesterday and Mr. Krieg has informally approved our approach.  This was the last major hurdle we had to clear to be able to release the RFP.  What we have to do now is get all the documents up to SAF/AQ for their signature.  We can't imagine any further major changes will occur after this point.  Our strategy should be pretty much good to go.

We hope to get everything up to the PEO office sometime the first week of June.  Exactly how long it will take to get the documents signed off, we can't say.  We'll stay on top of the processing of the package.  Interested parties shold not expect to see the RFP before June 25, but we'll work hard to get it out sooner if possible.

<DESC>Update:  The Government anticipates posting the solicitation by June 4, 2007. Proposals will be due 30 days from the solicitation date. 

Original Synopsis:  The Department of State (DOS) has a current requirement for telecommunications cable system design, installation and testing services. We anticipate awarding four  IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity) contracts .  Each contract will have a 12-month base year plus four 12-month Options. The contract ceiling is $2M per contract over 5 years.  Estimated  performance start date is June 2007.

The delivery orders will usually be for testing installed telecommunications cables systems at US Embassies and other diplomatic posts around the world but may require design and installation of systems at overseas posts on an infrequent basis.  The offer must be able to provide a Registered Communications Distribution Designer (RCDD) Archetect, A RCDD engineer and experienced Senior and Junior technicians.

This is a 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 541380 and the small business size standard is $11M.

In order to be considered for award of this contract, interested offerors, including all entities which comprise a joint venture, and the joint venture itself, must possess a Defense Security Service (DSS) Final Secret, Interim Top Secret or Final Top Secret facility clearance (FCL) with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M. At least two contracts will be awarded to firms currently possessing Interim or Final Top Secret FCLs, while firms with Final Secret FCLs may be selected for one or more additional awards.  Offerors must submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with the required qualification documentation.
Selected firms possessing a Final Secret FCL will be sponsored by Department of State for an FCL upgrade to the Top Secret level. Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the upgraded clearance. A period of 90 days from the date of selection for award will be allowed for the Secret cleared firm to obtain an Interim Top Secret FCL.  After this period, the Government may, at its discretion, consider not awarding the contract to the selected offeror.
Due to time constraints, the Government will not delay award of contracts to selected firms already in possession of Interim and Final Top Secret FCLs.  Contractor personnel requiring access to classified information or Controlled Access Areas (CAA) must possess Secret or Top Secret personnel security clearances issued by DSS prior to performance on the contract.

<DESC>Arthropods transmit the etiologic agents of several human diseases causing an important impact on public health within the United States. Plants have long been shown to have natural chemical defenses against arthropods. Development of new, environmentally safe vector-control methods is a very high priority for DVBID and CDC.  We hope that natural products prove more acceptable to the public than traditional pesticides and are effective against pesticide-resistant vectors. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to do the following two projects: Project 1--The vendor shall furnish all labor, materials and equipment necessary to evaluate the efficacy of two (2) all-natural biocides from forest resources (nootkatone and carvacrol) as acaricides against larval, nymphal, and adult deer ticks and lone star ticks in a field setting on Naval Weapons Station Earle, Colts Neck, New Jersey. The vendor will identify sixteen (16) suitable 144 sq. mile test plots in this Lyme endemic area that contain each life stage of the ticks, spray individual test plots with the natural product formulations, and control plots with water using backpack sprayers and personnel protective measures, conduct three (3) weekly pre-treatment flagging collections and weekly post-treatment flagging collections of ticks for four (4) months to determine the ability of these all-natural compounds to kill ticks and reduct the risk of tick-borne disease. The vendor will provide weekly reports and perform statistical analysis. Project 2: The vendor shall also furnish all labor, materials, traps, and equipment necessary to evaluate the efficacy of doxycycline-impregnated rodent bait to reduce infected rodent reservoirs and infected questing ticks in two (2) residential areas.  The vendor will identify suitable test plots for both studies, conduct weekly pre- and post-treatment flagging and trapping of animals in plots to determine the ability of doxy bait in rodent bait boxes to reduce the risk of tick-borned diseases. The vendor will provide weekly reports and perform statistical analysis. The period of performance shall commence upon receipt of a purchase order and shall continue for a period of 180 days. The vendor must be fully familiar with the process of evaluating tick control technologies including host-targeted devices and acaricides in a field setting.  This includes but is not limited to: applying of chemicals, safety measures, locating and identifying suitable tick habitat, marking plots, flagging for questing ticks, proper times and conditions to flag for ticks, knowledge of deer ticks, lone star ticks, and Lyme disease, knowledge of trapping rodents, processing rodents for infection, assaying ticks by PCR, evaluating baits and tick control using host-targeted devices such as bait boxes. The vendor must be able to conduct the study at weekly intervals and evaluate data using statistical analysis including the Henderson method for comparing efficacy of treated vs. control plots. It is believed there is a single source with the background and expertise necessary to complete the tasks outlined in this requirement.  No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.

<SUBJECT>S -- PV GENERATED POWER AT NAWS CHINA LAKE
<SOLNBR>N62473-07-R-5215
<RESPDATE>060807
<CONTACT>Rea Carlos, Contracting Officer, Phone 619-532-1103, Fax 619-532-3979, Email rea.carlos@navy.mil
<DESC>The Navy is conducting a market research to identify responsible sources and obtain information in regard to purchasing renewable power for Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) China Lake, located adjacent to Ridgecrest, CA.  Specifically, the Navy desires to purchase power generated from a photovoltaic (PV) system located on base, developed and constructed by a private entity or entities.  The intent of the Navy is to enter into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for the acquisition of approximately 22 megawatts (MW) of power, without any interest in the ownership of the PV system. The objective would be to incorporate all available Federal and State incentives or rebates for this type of renewable system into the project in order to maximize cost competitiveness with current electricity commodity. The desired location for the system is a site located on the southern portion of the base.  This potential agreement would also allow entities to sell power off-base to parties other than the Navy. Finally, it is the Navy?s desire to purchase power at a rate which is lower than what is currently being purchased for the base. The Navy purchases power for NAWS China Lake from Southern California Edison under Rate Schedule TOU-8. The Service Voltage is 33,000 volts.

NAWS China Lake is an aviation facility, and a potential PV development may be located within approach and departure flight paths. The Navy is interested in the potential impacts, if any, related to the existence of photovoltaic systems within critical flight zones. The Navy is seeking responses to this RFI that will include comments on the potential impact to aviation from these types of systems.

Specifically, the Navy is interested in identifying risks associated with awarding a PPA for NAWS China Lake, including; awarding a PPA within a timeframe where current Federal Tax Credits can be applied.  The current deadline for receiving the Solar Tax Credit is December 2008.  Perceived risks are Federal Tax Credits, project developer relationship with local utility company, impact of tariffs and associated costs for developing a large PV system, supply of PV materials, construction timelines, and capital financing availability. Comments on Renewable Energy Credits are of particular interest to the Navy. In the event that a REC market were to be created in California, how would industry incorporate the value into the project? In that scenario, would the Navy be able to retain any RECs?  

The Navy requests that interested parties submit a Statement of Interest with responses to the attached questionaire and as a minimum supply the following information:  (1) Name and location of company, type of business, (2) capability and pertinent experience, (3) financial capacity to develop and construct a PV system of desired magnitude and (4) points of contact.  Elaborate responses are neither required nor desired.  Any innovative and/or new conceptual ideas and recommendations for PPA alternatives are highly encouraged.  All information submitted will be considered proprietary and confidential.  The Statement of Interest is due 15 days after this posting date.  The maximum length of the Statement is 7 pages.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND A CONTRACT AWARD WILL NOT BE MADE FROM THE ATTACHED STATEMENT OF INTEREST. NAVFAC SW IS REQUESTING ASSISTANCE FROM THE INDUSTRY IN THE PREPARATION OF A PPA FOR PV GENERATED POWER CONTRACT. YOUR ANSWERS TO THE ATTACHED QUESTIONAIRE MAY BE USED TO TAILOR THE PROPOSED SOLICITATION DESCRIBED HEREIN. POC: MS. REA CARLOS (REA.CARLOS@NAVY.MIL) OR MR. EDWARD THIBODO (EDWARD.THIBODO@NAVY.MIL). MS. CARLOS CAN BE REACHED AT 619-532-1103 OR MR. THIBODO CAN BE REACHED  AT 619-532-4243.  RESPONSES TO THIS RFI SHOULD BE E-MAILED AND SENT TO THEIR ATTENTION AT:  NAVFAC SOUTHWEST, 1220 PACIFIC HIGHWAY, BUILDING 110, SAN DIEGO, CA,  92132.
 

STATEMENT OF INTEREST QUESTIONAIRE:

The primary purpose of this RFI is to seek discussion and feedback on these issues/ questions:

1.	Incorporation of all available Federal and State incentives and rebates, impacts to the type of project discussed, and any concerns or risks.
2.	Renewable energy credit (REC) impacts to this type project. Provide comments on the current state of RECs in California and economic impacts of retaining RECs if a market is created in California that allows sale and trading. Would the economics of this type project in a REC market allow for the Navy to retain any of the RECs?
3.	Impacts to aviation from large photovoltaic systems installed in and around critical aviation corridors adjacent to runways.
4.	Sale of electricity from the type of project discussed above to parties other than the Navy. 
5.	Assuming the 22MW peak load requirement for the Navy, and considering Issue #3, potentially what size system might industry envision.
6.	Alternate arrangements for Power Purchase Agreements for NAWS China Lake that do not include development of the renewable energy resource on Navy land. 

The Navy would also like to ascertain whether the sale of power to parties other than the Navy is either desirable and/or feasible.  In that regard, responses should address specifically what capacity or size of PV system would be envisioned. Potentially available land areas on NAWS China Lake are being identified, which may allow for development of a system capacity larger than the Navy?s requirement of 22MW.  Furthermore, the Navy requests information in regards to an alternate arrangement for a PPA where a site would be unspecified.   Responses should include considerations of site and location, total land area requirements, limitations of site and location, market demand for power, transmission and distribution costs, and any other pertinent information the responder deems should be brought to the attention of the Navy.

<DESC>Background

This is a market survey to locate potential sources for the development of an Overt Small Laser Marker (OSLM).  The United States Special Operations (USSOCOM) is researching the use of a light and compact laser marker system to mark targets for Laser Spot Track (LST) capable aircraft.  

Combat operations require Fire Support elements to be able to mark targets for LST capable aircraft from MOUNT and rural environments.  This laser marker must be light and compact enough for soldiers to carry on helicopter assaults and foot movements.  Reducing the size and weight of Fire Support equipment (e.g. Laser Target Designators (LTDs), Radios, Infrared (IR) pointers, etc.) is critical to ensure soldiers are able to carry vital equipment during all possible infiltration/exfiltration options.  These factors will reduce soldier fatigue, provide accurate target mark/identification (ID) in order to accurately engage enemy targets and ensure mission success. The tasks proposed by the customer in this Request for Information (RFI) shall provide for specifications of the (OSLM) for use in developmental and operational testing.  

This RFI is to assist the Government in determining the extent and capabilities of existing technology to meet the requirements of the OSLM.  The Government places emphasis on the proposed system?s size, light weight, and its ability to achieve the stated requirements.   The Government anticipates a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) to be published in 1QFY08 based on the outcome of this RFI. 

The Government requests respondees provide a plan to achieve the Threshold/Objective (T/O) requirements in a concise manner which shall consist of no greater than 10 pages and be composed in Times New Roman 12 pt font.  The Government requests that the offeror?s intended plan include a Schedule and Compliance Matrix detailing the plan?s compliance to stated specifications.  Moreover, it is requested the respondees provide information specifically addressing those items/specifications that can not be achieved during this effort.  The intended plan shall also include an estimated cost which shall consist of all design, development, non-recurring engineering and production costs for 2 prototype units which shall be used for testing and operational evaluation by the user.  Additionally, respondees shall submit a proposed production plan to meet fabrication requirements of the current customer?s Basis of Issue Plan (BOIP) of approximately 10 systems.

SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE

1	WHO SHOULD RESPOND? 
Any service provider who has the depth, capability and experience in doing the projects of this size and complexity.

2	DUE DATE:
June 15th, 2007

3	INTRODUCTION
The US Small Business Administration (SBA) relies on mainframe based legacy systems to support its mission of providing and servicing small business and disaster loans. These mainframe based legacy systems support the full life cycle (including financial management) of the following loan, loan guaranty and investment programs:
?	7(a)
?	504
?	Disaster (except loan origination)
?	Microloan
?	SBIC
The details about SBA and its loan programs can be found at http://www.sba.gov/.
These mainframe-based loan processing and accounting systems are inflexible and use obsolete technology. These stove piped systems are very expensive to maintain. These legacy systems don?t meet SBA?s current business needs and are very expensive to change to comply with current and future business needs. These systems are not compliant with accepted Federal security requirements, Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 and Financial System Integration Office?s (FSIO, also known as JFMIP) Core Financial Systems Requirements, Direct Loan Systems Requirements and Guaranteed Loan System Requirements. These systems are inefficient, outdated and don?t take advantage of the technological advances. They have been in place for approximately 50 years and significantly contribute to the amount of data reconciliation and manual processes required to do business. 
SBA has initiated a Loan Modernization effort to modernize its Loan Management and Loan Accounting Systems that will support loan origination, servicing, liquidation and financial management for its loan and loan guarantee programs. 
SBA?s vision is to adhere to the following guiding principles to implement modernized system(s):
?	Establish standardized set of data elements across all loan programs.
?	Implement single logical database with the clear separation of loan management data from the financial management data.
?	Implement electronic, real-time or near real-time, streamlined and simplified business processes.
?	Implement single Integrated Financial Management System using COTS that complies with FSIO?s (JFMIP) Core Financial Systems Requirements. 
?	Implement Integrated Loan Management System using COTS that complies with FSIO?s (JFMIP) Direct Loan System Requirements and Guaranteed Loan System Requirements and Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990.
?	Implement seamless integration between Loan Management and Financial Management processes.
?	Take advantage of technological advances in Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).
?	Take advantage of processes and systems developed and implemented by other Federal Agencies. For example, Treasury?s Pay.Gov.
?	Implement scalable, reliable, flexible, and highly available system using widely used technologies.
?	Implement appropriate internal controls to ensure the accuracy of data, completeness and consistency of transaction processing, and reporting in accordance with OMB Circular A-123, Management?s Responsibility for Internal Controls.
?	Comply with E-Gov initiatives and use a Shared Service Provider (SSP) for implementation, hosting and application management to achieve economies of scale.

4	OBJECTIVE

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to solicit and negotiate with only South Carolina Educational Television (SCETV), 1101 George Rogers Blvd., Columbia, SC  29201, on a sole source basis for the maintenance of National Weather Service (NWS) VHF equipment located on South Carolina Educational Television owned towers and buildings in the state of South Carolina.  Period of performance will be 01 October 2007 through 30 September 2008 with four one-year option periods.  The FSC for this is J058, the NAICS is 517910 and the small business size standard is $6.5 million.  The resulting contract will be a firm-fixed price contract.  
The contractor shall provide all maintenance and maintenance support services for 14 NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) transmitter systems at various locations throughout the state of South Carolina.  The contractor shall perform routine maintenance four times a year.  Upon completion of routine maintenance, the transmitter system will be fully operational and functional at the authorized output power as measured at the input to the transmission line, within the required frequency and modulation tolerance, and in compliance will all technical descriptions and specifications in NWR operational specifications and requirements, and the OEM equipment manuals.  The contractor shall monitor, via dial-in government furnished software, all transmitters on a monthly basis to verify that parameters are within specifications.  The contractor will accomplish all corrective maintenance identified by the contractor or requested via a service call by the National Weather Service (NWS).  All service calls shall be answered and responded to 24 hours a day, 365 days per year.  All site outages shall be corrected so that the Mean Time to Restore (MTTR) per site will not exceed 12 consecutive hours.  Maintenance will be provided so that no Contractor maintained transmitter system will experience site outage in excess of 88 hours per year.  A transmitter site configured with a dual transmitter is considered in a degraded operational mode if either transmitter is not capable of operating at its full authorized power.  The contractor will perform corrective maintenance on a degraded site within 48 hours of notice and restore it to full operation within 72 hours.  The NWS and the Contractor shall perform annual signal strength measurements to ensure that overall system performance has not deteriorated.  The signal strength measurements shall be made at a minimum of four different land locations approximately 90 degrees apart and a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 20 statute miles from the transmitter site.  The time interval between the annual measurements shall be from 9 to 13 months.  The Contractor shall provide the NWR focal point within 24 hours of completion of any maintenance on a contractor maintained system.  
In an effort to ensure that the NWS carries out its mission of providing warnings and forecasts directly to the public to protect life and property, the NWS operates the NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) network to provide continuous transmission of recorded weather and appropriate all-hazards warning information to the public.  The NWR is linked to the National Emergency Alert System and the Homeland Security's All Hazard Warning System, which enables the NWS to reach more people with timely, site-specific severe weather warning.  South Carolina Educational Television is a key participant in South Carolina's Emergency Alert System, and the Homeland Security?s All Hazard Warning System.  To ensure preparedness and the capability to respond at all levels, it is critical that SCETV interface regularly with local and federal counterparts.  Communication systems located at SCETV include the NOAA Weather Radio Systems, digital and direct land lines to South Carolina Emergency Management Division (SCEMD), FM transmitters, and microwave broadcasting equipment, linking SCETV to commercial radio and television stations throughout the state.  Fourteen NWRs are mounted on SCETV-owned towers because a proportion of South Carolina residents are not within listening range of an NWR station and SCETV has existing transmitting towers in these remote locations and is a participant of the EAS and the All Hazard Warning System.  Due to the sensitive and secure broadcast equipment each transmitter tower contains, SCETV only grants access to State-commissioned employees.    
The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by June 1, 2007.  Written requests for additional information may be faxed to (757) 664-3653.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all proposals received within ten days after publication of this notice.  Evidence must be provided of the ability to provide required services.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  To be eligible for award, offerors must have a valid DUNS Number and be registered n the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

     3.  Price

  I.  Delivery Date
     
A.	Evidence of ability to meet the required Delivery Date of June 28, 2007 will be considered.
B.	If vendor is unable to meet the aforementioned required Delivery Date, an alternative date may be offered and will be considered.

 II.  Technical Acceptability

III.   Price

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.  

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.

OTI's strategic objectives are based on the premise that fast, direct, and overt political development assistance is needed as a catalyst to move countries beyond crisis to stability.  When a crisis occurs in a priority country, OTI has the ability to engage in that country and initiate a country program.  A country program is designed to address the fundamental constraints prohibiting the country from emerging from crisis. 

USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  The typical OTI country strategy follows US Government policy and directly involves: reshaping hard-line attitudes and perceptions; promoting democracy, human rights, and basic freedoms; disseminating objective information; and effecting positive political change -- wherever and whenever possible.

OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society, development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation, identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs, and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate, OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organizations programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/.

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this contract is to hire a Human Resources Specialist within OTIs Operations and Management Division.  The Human Resources Specialist reports directly to the Chief of OTIs Operations and Management Division.  The Human Resources Specialist supervises OTIs PSC human resources team, which supports OTI program-funded PSCs in the area of human resources and employee relations, training, personnel, and travel services.  The Human Resources Specialist manages the operations and administration of all human resource related activities in support of OTI program implementation.

This is a supervisory position.  The position may require occasional international travel and the successful individual must be available to fulfill this duty as required.

The position is being solicited as a tandem/ladder position.  Applicants may submit for more than one position/grade level, but must submit a separate application for each.  Applicants will be accepted/denied based on the position to which they applied (e.g., an applicant for the GS-13 position may not be accepted for a GS-12 position/grade level).  If hired at the GS-12 equivalent level, the selected employee may be eligible for promotion to the GS-13 equivalent level.  Promotion to the GS-13 level is not guaranteed, and may only occur after working a minimum of 24 months at the GS-12 level, and after receiving a recommendation for promotion by the supervisor as part of an excellent performance evaluation.  

OBJECTIVE

The objective for this position is to build dedicated capacity for executing human resources tasks in support of OTI's cadre of PSCs worldwide.  A secondary objective is to provide additional backstop supervision capabilities within the OTI Operations and Management Division.  

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Human Resource Specialist shall manage human resources support and guidance for approximately 70 Washington and field-based USPSC staff, in addition to a number of field-based Foreign National PSC (FNPSC) staff in the Bureau of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance/Office of Transition Initiatives (DCHA/OTI).  While 95% of support is for program funded PSCs who implement OTIs programs, up to 5% may also include DCHA/OTI Direct Hire staff.

This position will be based in Washington and report to the Chief of DCHA/OTIs Operations and Management Division.  The incumbent must provide a high level of customer service, and is expected to exercise considerable independent judgment in planning, overseeing and reviewing PSC human resources functional areas of DCHA/OTI.   The Human Resources Specialist will serve as OTIs functional expert on USPSC and FNPSC human resources management, providing advice, interpretation and timely service to all levels of DCHA/OTI, helping to ensure that staff morale is maintained and that staff and implementing partners are trained in OTI program implementation/operations.

The successful applicant must demonstrate an aptitude for a broad range of human resources activities including training support, a strong interest in international development, excellent interpersonal skills, and the potential to assume progressively greater responsibility.  He or she must have a strong customer service ethic, and should be a good communicator responsive, approachable, open-minded, a good listener, and a team player who fosters a team environment and encourages staff to share ideas, information and feedback.  He or she must be willing to take on a variety of tasks, large and small, to ensure overall program success.  Since work may require frequent changes in program direction and implementation, including regular coordination, the individual must be someone who is flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change.  

Specific duties include the following:

GS-12 duties and responsibilities:

* Manage all professional development activities for DCHA/OTI Washington and Field personnel (approximately 95% program funded, and 5% direct hire staff); 

* Ensure appropriate procedures are followed in regards to OTI PSC employee relations matters such as the proper and timely completion of employee evaluations, the development of annual employee work objectives by supervisors and employees, the development of individual job requirements, and employee professional development;

* Provide PSC human resource advice and professional recommendations to the supervisor, and OTI Sr. Management as appropriate;

* Manage OTIs PSC recognition awards program, and provide advice and initiate or support activities related to employee morale-building and other incentive-building activities; 

* Supervise several full-time PSC employees in various PSC support functions (e.g. personnel services, training, etc), and if required, act as back-stop CTO for institutional contractors in the area of training and orientation.  For full-time PSC employees supervised, the incumbent will prepare annual work plans and annual performance evaluations, and provide mentoring and training in the areas related to general human resources, general administrative support, and personnel management; 

* Provide oversight of OTIs operations and program implementation orientation and training activities; ensure that staff are aware of office, bureau, and agency training requirements as well as options, and maintain a DCHA/OTI staff training database;

* Develop and maintain a human resources system for program-funded staff that meets senior management information needs;

* Establish and maintain good working relationships with other USAID offices and bureaus in relation to human resources and PSC issues;

* When required, participate on inter-office, inter-bureau, or inter-agency committees where issues relate to OTIs program goals;

* Draft and/or review personal service contract scopes of work;

* Coordinate preparation, review, and submission of personnel approval memos for program funded staff;

* Ensure completion of budgeting and contracting action needs within the human resources team;

* When required by the Chief of the Operations and Management Division, provide administrative program implementation support to field offices by assisting OTIs USPSC Senior Management Advisors in training for FNPSC staff, inputting FNPSC scopes of work into the Agency required format (CAJE), working with OTI staff on field training programs which involve OTI and implementing partner staff, and performing other field support tasks.  The incumbent will perform other duties and activities as required to help ensure the successful implementation of OTI programs, such as administrative, travel, information and technology, records management, other personnel and contractual support;

* Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful completion of OTI country programs.

GS-13 duties and responsibilities:

Include all of the above duties, as well as:  

* Identify legal requirements and government reporting regulations affecting USPSC and FNPSC human resources functions and ensure that OTI policies, procedures and reporting are in compliance;

* Perform complex HR-related projects as assigned by the supervisor;

* When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, such as serving in the capacity of acting Division Chief, for example.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Human Resources Specialist will take direction from and will report to the Chief - OTI Operations and Management Division or his/her designee.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Assessment teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

It will be deployed near or in the harbor.  Sea conditions vary from large, rolling waves to 2-3 ft. high waves in the harbor.

2.   Support equipment - Will you be deploying from shore or from vessels? Do you have cranes available on the shore or the vessels?

We will be deploying from shore.  We do have cranes and large harbor forklifts available on shore.

3.    Draft - What is the depth of water where you would be working if there was a spill?

Draft is from several feet to very deep.

4.   Oil - what type of oils do you handle and may need to recover?

Bunker C, frying grease, motor oils, diesel/JP8, and gasoline.

5.   Power – Is there a requirement for a hydraulic power unit?

There is no need for a hydraulic power unit as the hydraulic power system from a heavy equipment will power it such as from a tractor or bobcat.  All we need is the hydraulic fittings to fit them, i.e. intake and outlet spring pressure-loaded relief valves.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.

nsurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 smart card IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new smart card IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAIDs information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAIDs information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAIDs information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individuals employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.
The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAIDs information systems.
