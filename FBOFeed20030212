<CONTACT>Amy Dahlke Procurement Clerk 7022938779     adahlke@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement for the development of a tourism and security plan that accommodates and takes advantage of the Hoover Dam Bypass Bridge scheduled for completion in 2007.  The plan is to include a site design and implementation program in sufficient detail and data for Reclamation to implement the plan, initiate the development of construction documents and specifications, and initiate required environmental clearances.  Security is a component of this study but it is not the primary focus.  The primary focus is managing a million plus tourists a year in a friendly and positive way that takes advantage of the lack of traffic across the dam. The plan shall consist of the development and evaluation of several alternatives with a final recommendation for a preferred site design and plan based on a set of ranked decision criteria: (a) elimination or reduction of unofficial vehicular traffic on and near the Dam; (b) improved parking, visitor circulation, and access to the Visitor Center and the top of the dam; (c) reduced cost of handling tickets (improved user fee collection system); (d) improved quality of the visitor's experience, learning, and enjoyment; (e) improved top of dam security; and (f) opportunities to stimulate visitation.  The study area for the plan is on land adjacent to Highway 93 in the area of Hoover Dam.  The study area is between the two mile marker on the Arizona side of the dam and the Hacienda Hotel on the Nevada side.  Site security, computer security and emergency plans within the Hoover Dam and Visitor Center structures, and transmission lines and substations adjacent to Hoover Dam are not part of this study.  Displays and tourist movement inside the Visitor Center are not part of this study. This solicitation is unrestricted.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541990 All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.  The estimated price range of this project is between $100,000 - $250,000.  The solicitation in the form of a Request for Proposal (RFP), will be issued on or about March 3, 2003 with offers due thirty (30) days after.  No documents will be available until the solicitation is issued.  The solicitation will only be issued electronically via www.FedBizOpps.gov.  The Government reserves the right to issue the solicitation on paper or CD-ROM if the FedBizOpps (FBO) web site becomes inoperable or if the Contracting Officer determines it is in the Government's best interest to do so.  Offerors should register at FBO to be included on the offeror list to download the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  Questions may be submitted to Amy Dahlke at Adahlke@lc.usbr.gov or by fax at 702-293-8499.  Please reference the solicitation number 03-SP-30-0114 on all correspondence.

<DESC>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) requires the charter of a trawl vessel to conduct studies of 1) rockfish habitat in the Aleutian Islands and 2) gear performance and fish behavior in pelagic trawls. The charter will consist of a period of 7 days for sea trials in the Puget Sound area in late May 2003, transport of supplies and equipment for the charters from Seattle, WA to Dutch Harbor, AK prior to the start of the projects, 16 consecutive days during June 2003 (rockfish study), and 10 days in mid August 2003 (pelagic trawl study).  The rockfish and pelagic trawl study periods will begin and end in Dutch Harbor, Alaska. Since it may be difficult for a vessel to meet all of the specifications for both the rockfish and pelagic trawl portions of the charter, offerors may submit alternative proposals for consideration of a vessel that may meet most but not all of the vessel requirements. In general, the vessel requirements include a minimum overall length of 36.5m (120 ft); minimum main engine continuous horsepower of 1000; able to tow a 27.2/37.4 m (89/123 ft) or comparable bottom trawl and a side scan sonar unit at a continuous speed of no more or less than 5.6 km/hr (3 kts); able to tow a contractor provided pelagic trawl at 3.5 knots or faster; maintain a speed of at least 16.8 km/hr (9 kts) cruising speed in reasonable seas; and have sufficient fuel holing capacity to conduct operations for at least 30 days without refueling. There must be berthing accommodations for up to 8 project scientists during the rockfish study and up to 6 project scientists during the pelagic trawl study, as well as a crew consisting of at least 4 fishermen and a captain. Scientific personnel may include women. A Request for Proposals providing detailed technical and performance specifications and proposal instructions will be issued on or about February 28, 2003.  To receive a copy of the solicitation, make your request in writing to Crystina Elkins at the fax number or email address provided in this announcement.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announces FY 2004 Nuclear Energy Protocol for Reseach Isotopes (NEPRI).  This is an annual process by which DOE determines the isotopes needed by the research community to explore and develop new and innovative uses for isotopes.  The goal of NEPRI is to generate a list of research isotopes that DOE will consider producing in FY04 (starting Oct 1 2003). The Department asks that members of the research community complete a NEPRI Pre-Order Form.  The Pre-Order Form requests information with regard to what isotopes are needed, quantity required, approximate date of delivery, and how these isotopes support the goals of the research program.  This is a peer-review process designed to assure DOE produces those isotopes that will return the most benefit to the research community and general public. The Pre-Order Form is to be mailed during March 2003 to past subscribers, customers and interested researchers.  The completed form must be returned no later than close of business June 20, 2003.  The Pre-Order Form will also be posted at http://www.ornl.gov/isotopes/catalog.html, below for those who wish to submit the form electronically.  All researchers interested in having DOE produce their isotopes in FY04 are strongly encouraged to submit a complete Pre-Order Form.  Failure to do so may mean your isotope will not be produced in FY04. We intend to publish the NEPRI list of research isotopes during the third week of July 2003.  Orders for these isotopes may be placed after that date but no later than close of business September 19, 2003. For more information with regard to NEPRI, or obtain a Pre-Order Form, contact: Isotope Business Office Oak Ridge National Laboratory P.O.Box 2008, Bldg. 7606A Oak Ridge, TN 37831-6426 Telephone No:  (865)574-6984 Fax No: (865) 574-6986 Email: isotopes@ornl.gov http://www.ornl.gov/isotopes/catealog.html

<DESC>It is the intent of this solicitation to contract for all labor, material and equipment to Repair Bullard Hall (Bldg. 233) Project RC 12-02 at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, CA.  Work includes but is not limited to: repair and partial replacement of the electrical system with relocation of the inner transformers to an outside pad mount, total repair of the mechanical system, bringing the building to code in fire and life safety, re-roofing the building, minor construction of new office space, and renovation of existing office and classrooms. Background information:  Bullard Hall was constructed around 1952, and contains approximately 24,000 SF on two levels.  The building has large open spaces toward the core with offices, labs, and smaller classrooms on the perimeter.  The current electrical system is a mix of many different power ratings and was designed to mimic shipboard conditions on older ships.  The mission of the school has changed negating the need for the dated system.  The ventilation of the building is currently met by natural ventilation from the windows and minor forced air in the core labs.  Currently 5,000 SF of the building is air conditioned with a plan to add a chilled water type system to provide for flexibility in air conditioning.  Steam unit heaters currently provide for heating.  Many larger spaces have been subdivided to add needed office space.  This in turn has left areas without proper ventilation and heating.  The plan is to meet the heating need with a central station pre-heat and perimeter zone baseboard type system.  The building will require minor demolition of existing walls and the addition of new walls on both levels and six new office spaces on the second floor.  The building will be occupied for the duration of the contract. Proposer will be provided one occupied floor at a time.  Utility outages (electrical, HVAC etc.) will be kept to a minimum limiting the disruption to the customer, i.e., during weekends or school breaks.  This is a firm-fixed-price contract.  The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. This procurement is an 8(a) certified contractor competition.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 233320, and the related small business size standard is $28.5 million.  The government will evaluate proposals using two-phase source selection procedures.  The contract will be awarded to the firm providing the proposal with the best value to the Government using factors outlined in the solicitation:  (1) Past Performance; (2) Corporate and Key Personnel Experience; and (3) Scheduling/Plan.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL ISSUE THIS SOLICITATION THROUGH THE INTERNET.  Plans and specifications will NOT be directly provided in a paper hard copy format or compact disk (CDs).  Notification of any changes to this solicitation will be made ONLY on the Internet site.  It is, therefore, the contractor's responsibility to check the below listed Internet site for any posted changes in this solicitation's plans and specifications which will be available on or about 24 June 2002.  Contractor response to factors (1) and (2) above will be due approximately 22 July 2002 with the complete proposal including factor (3) and price due approximately 6 August 2002.  Download from the Internet is free of charge; however, the plans and specifications may take time to download.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division intends to enter into negotiations for a Firm Fixed Price contract, on an Other Than Full and Open Competition basis, to Software Engineering Professionals (SEP) Inc., 655 W. Carmel Drive, Suite 100, Carmel, IN 46032, for the development of AV-8B Maintenance Station (AMS) software in support of the Engine Monitoring Unit (EMU) upgrade for the Rolls Royce F402-RR-408A/B engine on the AV-8B Night Attack and Harrier II Plus platforms.  The AMS software shall be modified to process and display the corresponding parametric data of the new parameter validation, parameter limits, and algorithms that are embedded in the EMU software.  The AMS software shall be modified to generate the fault guided libraries for the new EMU incidents contained in the F402-RR-408A/B Engine Monitoring Systems and AV-8B Maintenance Station Functional Requirements (E/REL/DC/25627).  It is anticipated that the AMS will require a new database when the new parameter list is incorporated with continuous data.  The contractor will be required to perform trade studies and determine the database that will best support the functionality while maintaining supportability of the AMS.  The new database will be prototyped and functionally tested at the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA.  The US133 program has been divided into two (2) phases.  In Phase I, SEP provided the upgraded software suite for converting the DOS-based Data Processing Ground Station (DPGS) to the Windows-based AV-8B Maintenance Station (AMS).  In Phase II SEP provided maintenance modifications to resolve fleet generated software trouble reports and improvements to the EMU and AMS.  SEP is the principal Engine Monitoring System (EMS) software developer.  SEP developed and provides the maintenance stations software to view and analyze EMS data and provide maintenance diagnostics for military and commercial aircraft.  The AMS software development for the EMU upgrade will entail completing the US133 phase II software and implementing a new database.  Software that was begun by SEP and put on the shelf will need to be completed and functionally tested.  The contract will be for an estimated period of performance of fourteen months (date of award through 30 June 2004).  Responses to this intent to solicit, other than from the source listed, will be required to submit information to verify their prior experience in the development of Engine Monitoring Systems.  Responses shall be submitted to Debbie Winfield at the address noted above by 28 February 2003.  Notes 22 and 26 Apply

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health, announces the availability of a Broad Agency Announcement/Request for Proposals (BAA/RFP) to establish training and research facilities that would support the study of rodent models of spinal cord injury (SCI).  The NINDS is the lead governmental agency for the funding of research on SCI, and proposes to establish national Facilities of Research Excellence in SCI (FOR-SCI) that will train new researchers on best practices in the field of SCI, including the standards of current research methodology, analytical protocols and functional outcome evaluations.  Under this BAA, these facilities will provide, in the same location, resources, capabilities and expertise in SCI research.  These will include the ability to work with multiple standard models of injury in rats and/or mice, and the facilities and personnel for expert handling, care and the medical management of animals with SCI.  They will have dedicated facilities and expertise for conducting surgery, including microsurgery such as transplants and grafts, and for cellular analyses ranging from neuroanatomy and histology to electrophysiology and other cutting-edge technologies.  These facilities will also provide training for individuals from graduate students to faculty, both within and outside of the organization, to promote consistency of procedures and practices across laboratories.  A facility/center should also be able to provide training on the assessment of standard outcome measures and to participate in the development of new and relevant means of evaluating recovery from spinal cord dysfunction.  Another role of the support shall be to review and replicate novel treatments for SCI, and to compare the efficacy of different treatments in a standardized environment with a minimum of variability in surgery, animal care, outcome evaluation and cellular analyses.  Finally, these sites could be the nuclei/nexus for collaborative studies on SCI.  It is anticipated that one or two cost-reimbursement type contracts will be made for a period of five years in September 2002.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.  BAA/Request for Proposal (BAA/RFP) No. NIH-NINDS-02-09 will be available electronically and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov) or through the NINDS website at the following URL address:  (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/currentrfps.htm) 15 or more calendar days after the issuance of this synopsis.  OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINELY CHECKING THIS WEBSITE FOR ANY POSSIBLE SOLICITATION AMENDMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED.  NO INDIVIDUAL NOTIFICATION OF ANY AMENDMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Refer to numbered note 26.  ****

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Diretor de Recursos Hidricos, Superintendencia de Desenvolvimento de Recursos Hidricos e Saneamento Ambiental (SUDERHSA)-Secretaria de Estado do Meio Ambiente e Recursos Hidricos, Governo do Estado do Parana, Rua Santo Antonio 239, CEP 80230 120 Curitiba, Parana, Brasil, Tel: 011-55-41-333-4774, Fax: 011-55-41-333-3621  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Technical Assistance for the support of the implementation of the Tibagi River Basin Program in Brazil.

The project sponsor is the Superintendency of Water Resources Development and Environmental Sanitation (SUDERHSA) of the State of Parana Secretariat of the Environment and Water Resources.  SUDERHSA is in the process of establishing the Tibagi River Basin Committee, which will be responsible for a system of permits and fees for water use that is expected to result in new investments in process improvements and wastewater treatment.  This Technical Assistance will characterize water withdrawals and pollutant loads in the Basin.  This information will be used in the development of a system of charges affecting public water and sewer utilities and industries.  The revenues generated will become a revolving fund that water users can apply towards water management and pollution control investments. 

The terms of reference for the Technical Assistance would include the following tasks: 1) identification/description of water withdrawals and uses, 2) field characterization of process wastewater and effluent, 3) development of a computerized database of water users, and 4) needs assessment and Technical Assistance.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $370,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.

Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

<SUBJECT>B -- B. Feasibility Study On The SANEPAR Industrial Water Reuse Project
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-0250016A
<RESPDATE>032403
<ARCHDATE>04082003

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Companhia de Saneamento do Parana-SANEPAR Grupo Especifico de Consultoria Intercambio e Pesquisa-GECIP Rua Engenheiros Reboucas 1376 CEP 80215 900 Curitiba, Parana Brasil, Tel: (55) (41) 330-3048, Fax: (55) (41) 330-3109  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the industrial reuse of treated sewage in Curitiba and Londrina, Brazil.

The project sponsor, Companhia de Saneamento do Parana (SANEPAR), is a water and wastewater services company owned 60% by the state of Parana and 40% by Andrade Gutierrez, SA, Copel Opportunity Daleth, SA and Vivendi. The company operates 630 systems in 40 municipalities in Parana, which supply nearly 14.5 million cubic meters of water per month to residential, commercial and industrial users.

SANEPAR is interested in establishing an industrial water reuse business.  The near-term market will include industries in Curitiba and Londrina, which represents a potential demand for 500 liters per second of treated water.  The long-term market throughout the state of Paran? is estimated to be 2,300 liters per second.  Currently, SANEPAR?s industrial client base is small relative to its total customer base, which is composed of primarily residential customers.  Its ability to develop a market for the reuse of water will depend on developing a new market outside of its current customer base.  SANEPAR has an initial target market of 13 large industrial facilities in Curitiba, which currently receive about 105,000 cubic meters per month of potable water from SANEPAR. The consumption of reuse water by these companies would encourage other local industries currently relying on their own wells.  The Curitiba market could be served by water reuse systems operating at four to eight locations in the Curitiba area and an additional three to five systems in the Londrina area. The investment required to develop the industrial water reuse market in Curitiba and Londrina in the near term is estimated at $21 million, while at the long term rate of 2,300 liters per second, would be $95 million.

The terms of reference for the feasibility study would include the following tasks: 1) identify large and medium industries and select representative sample to be surveyed, 2) case study development, and 3) financial and implementation plan.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $115,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is seeking proposals from business entities interested in participating in an acquisition as a Prime Vendor (PV) to provide items under the general groupings of lumber and related products and woodworking machinery and tools for the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.  A PV, or integrated suppliers, can be defined as the designation of a single source of supply for a wide range of products.  The requirements covered under this solicitation include, but are not limited to, Federal Supply Class (FSC) 55: softwood lumber, hardwood lumber, plywood/veneer, poles, pilings, ties, crossarms, dowels, plugs, stakes, doors and moldings and FSC 32: sawmill and planing mill machinery, woodworking machines/tools and attachments for woodworking machinery.  This is a representative list and should not be considered exhaustive of all products that will be required of the acquisition.  The intended solicitation will cover the Mid-Atlantic region of the US which is defined as the states of Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia, West Virginia and Washington DC.  The intended solicitation will contain a listing of the military customers located within this region.

The intended solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis with the resultant contract being an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) for two (2) base years and three (3) one-year options.  Estimated value of this acquisition is $8,808,000 for the base period; $22,022,000 for total contract period.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this Modification (No. Two) of synopsis/solicitation number OAM-2003-N-0002 is to revise  documents of the RFP.  All offerors that are presently on the emailing list and have already requested a copy of the emailed addendums to the requirement.  All offerors that have not requested a copy of the addendum clauses and SOW must request a copy by emailing a request to the email address below.  GAO responses to the prospective offerors' questions are as follows:  Question #1.  RFP page 1, Synopsis, states that the optional desktop reservations booking system must have a self-service web based online travel booking engine with the flexibility to be interfaced with Gelco?s Travel Manager 8.1 or higher.  Is GAO currently using Travel Manager 8.1?  Are there plans to upgrade to Travel Manager 8.2?  If so, is there a defined timetable for doing so?  We ask because there are some enhanced features that are available with Travel Manager 8.2, that we can offer that may be attractive to GAO.  Is the LOC also using Travel Manager?  If so, which version, and if not, are there any plans to do so? Response to Question # 1:  GAO is currently piloting Travel Manager 8.1 and plans to have it in full use by September 30, 2003.  Although we plan to upgrade to Travel Manager 8.2, no specific date has been set for the upgrade.  LOC is in the process of procuring a new financial system and plans to include an automated travel system as part of the financial package.  At present, what the financial and travel systems will be is uncertain.  LOC is not currently using Travel Manager or any travel system at this time.   Question #2. RFP page 2, Background, list the total travel expenditures in terms of dollars.  Since most agencies base staffing upon productivity measurements such as number of tickets or number of expected phone calls, can the government provide the number of tickets that were issued for GAO and for the LOC for the past twelve months or past calendar year? This information is available from the incumbent contractor as all travel companies operate from this information.  In fact, GAO requires the contractor to provide this type of information in its monthly reports for both Headquarters and field offices.  We assume that such information on a summarized version could be provided to all offerors so that we may more accurately understand the work to be performed so that all offerors could propose the most competitive pricing.  Response to Question # 2:  GAO:  12,000 and LOC:  3,500.  Question # 3. RFP page 3, Reservations and Ticketing Services, states that the contractor is expected to make available to GAO any specialized reservation assistance normally provided to contractor?s preferred commercial accounts, such as international travel desks, executive help desks, dedicated hotel, car and other supplier desks, and group/meeting arrangements.  Does GAO understand that these types of specialized reservation assistance are provided at additional fees?  Would the contractor be permitted to charge extra for such services as they are utilized? For instance, would the contractor be entitled to charge a separate fee for those international reservations that are reviewed by the international rate desk (this is the current commercial practice)?  Response to Question # 3:  GAO?s RFP asks contractors to submit proposals for all the services requested by the Statement of Work.  GAO does not intend to direct contractors on how they should propose to offer these services.  Question # 4.  RFP Page 3, Reservations and Ticketing Services, states that the reservations system must be a Web based application.  Is GAO referring to the optional desktop reservations system for use of GAO travelers and staff, or the global distribution system (GDS, formerly referred to as CRS) used by the TMC?  Response to Question # 4:  GAO is referring to the desktop reservations system for use by GAO travelers.  Question # 5.  RFP Page 3, Reservations and Ticketing Services, states that the TMC will ?claim travelers? awards for frequent flyer airline benefits.? As most frequent traveler award programs must be handled directly with the air carrier, and not through a TMC, can the GAO be more specific regarding this service requirement?  Does the GAO allow their travelers to keep frequent traveler benefits for personal use?  Response to Question # 5:  GAO travelers are allowed to keep frequent flyer benefits earned in conjunction with official travel for their personal use.  GAO employees include their frequent flyer account information in their ?Traveler?s Profiles? on file with the TMC.  Employees? frequent flyer account numbers should be sent to the airlines when the TMC books reservations.  The TMC should also include employees? frequent flyer account numbers on the employees? trip itinerary.   Question # 6.  RFP page 4, Reservations and Ticketing Services, states that the contractor must assist travelers in obtaining passports and visas. Is GAO looking for comprehensive passport and visa services, or simply help in obtaining information and forms for the traveler?  Response to Question # 6:  We are not asking the TMC to obtain passports or visas for GAO travelers.  GAO would like the TMC to help travelers obtain visa and passport information and forms if requested by the traveler.  When GAO employees travel to countries where electronic visas may be obtained by the travel agency, we would ask for our TMC to assist our employees with obtaining electronic visas.  Question # 7:  RFP page 5, Reservations and Ticketing Services, states that the contractor is permitted to charge for delivery fees when the traveler determines that electronic tickets are not acceptable.  Is the government aware that airlines now charge for issuance of paper tickets and that some airlines have proposed to eliminate paper tickets for domestic travel by March 2003?  Is the government prepared to pay the airline-imposed fees for paper tickets?   The RFP also requires the contractor to provide ticket delivery for emergency tickets at appropriate domestic airports within two hours notice by the traveler.  With e-tickets being the primary method for issuance of tickets, why is the government still requiring manual delivery of paper tickets?  Response to Question # 7:  GAO is aware of the current status of paper tickets in the airline industry.  GAO does not normally reimburse travelers for paper tickets for domestic travel, however, our policy does not prohibit employees from requesting and paying for paper tickets.  Until the airlines no longer issue paper tickets for domestic travel, we would like our TMC to be able to provide our travelers paper tickets when they are requested.  GAO's internal policy states that the employees will be reimbursed for paper tickets for all foreign travel.  Question # 8: RFP page 5, Reservations and Ticketing Services, states that the GAO requires both an invoice and a ticket receipt. Will delivery of an e-mail itinerary and access to print a receipt from the web meet GAO?s requirement?  With self-book reservations tools there is no ticket receipt.  Travelers must access the web to print receipts; however, an e-mail itinerary can be an option with the self-book tool.  Response to Question # 8:  Yes, the delivery of an e-mail itinerary and access to print a receipt from the web will meet GAO?s requirement.  Question # 9:  RFP page 5, Reconciliation of Centrally Billed Accounts, states that the contractor shall acknowledge receipt of a transaction file from the charge card vendor within one working day.  To whom should this acknowledgement be sent?  Response to Question # 9:  The Offeror who is awarded the contract will be advised of this information by our charge card provider.  Question # 10:  RFP page 6, Facilities, states that GAO?s hours of operations are 7:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET. Does GAO require the on-site operation at GAO headquarters to be staffed during those hours, or does the GAO require telephone reservations service from 7:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET, with the physical office open for a normal eight-hour business day?  Does the GAO require staffed offices at any other GAO location?  Response to Question # 10: GAO?s RFP requires telephone reservation service from 7:30 am to 7:00 pm. ET.  GAO also requests information, as a separate value added item, on the costs of having a travel agent at its headquarters office in Washington, DC and the LOC for a normal eight-hour business day.  Question # 11:  RFP Addendum Statement of Work, Item 2, Customer Support, Training, states that the contractor will conduct training seminars concerning TMC services at least once a year.  Is this training conducted at GAO?s headquarters, at its regional offices, or at both? Will reimbursement for travel costs incurred by the TMC for training at various GAO locations be reimbursed in accordance with Addendum XI, Items 19 and 20?  Response to Question # 11:  No.  We would like the training seminars to take place in Washington, DC.  Field seminars may take place by telecommunication from our Washington, DC office.  Question # 12:  RFP Section XI, Addendum, Custom GAO Clauses, Page 5,  Item 5, Library of Congress Contract Requirements, indicates that space will be provided for an on-site TMC for the LOC, at a no-charge, non-interference basis and that the government will provide reasonable office furnishings. Is an on-site TMC required? Also, please define what is meant by ?non-interference? basis? Does this mean that the LOC would allow travel business other than LOC?s to be managed through this on-site office? We ask because the annual air volume of the LOC is estimated in the RFP to be only $750,000, and this volume is insufficient to attain any economies of scale that would result in lowered costs for LOC. Would the LOC consider service from off site?  Response to Question # 12:  The LOC does not require the services of an on-site TMC.  However, the LOC, like GAO, would like to be advised of the cost for an on-site travel agent.  The LOC will allow other government travel business to be managed through the on-site office if it decides to exercise the value added option.  Question # 13:  RFP Section XI Addendum Custom GAO Clauses, Page 7, Item 8, Billing and Payment, lists GTR as a potential form of payment. What percentage of travel booked uses GTR as form of payment?  Is the government individual charge card the primary form of payment, with minimal use of the GTS? Sub-item (d) of this RFP section also requires that the contractor ?may bill no more frequently than once every two weeks.?  Travel agents must follow the rules of the Airlines Reporting Corporation, which operates on a Monday to Sunday reporting cycle. We must then report each week?s sales on the Tuesday of the following week, or two days after the closing of the reporting cycle.  Would the government consider changing the requirement to allow billing on a weekly basis in accordance with the travel industry requirement to report and pay air carrier vendors on a weekly basis?  Response to Question # 13:  Government travel charge cards (individually and centrally billed) are the primary forms of payment for travel.  GAO has not used a GTR in the last 7 years but we have included the provision for its use because it can be required for some rare foreign travel situations.  We do not plan to use GTRs unless GTRs are required for a specific foreign travel situation.  The billing in this section refers to billing GAO, not the agency?s charge card company.  Question # 14:  RFP Section XI Addendum Custom GAO Clauses, Page 9, Item 11, Compensation, seems to contract RFP Addendum Custom GAO Clauses, Page 1, Item 1, in that it implies that the contractor will be allowed to charge no fees for services. Item 11 states that reimbursement to the contractor for transportation services under this contract ?will be limited to actual carrier fares effective for air, rail, bus and steamship tickets issued by the contractor . . .? and that other ?compensation for services provided under this contract may be in the form of commissions received by the contractor from carriers and suppliers . . ..?  Please clarify. Would the government consider removal of these paragraphs from the RFP?  Response to Question # 14:  This section refers to the fact that the agency will only pay for tickets that are specifically authorized by the agency on the travel authorization.  If the TMC issues tickets without a travel authorization, the agency will not be responsible for payment of any fees.  Question # 15:  RFP Section XI Addendum Custom GAO Clauses, Page 15, Item 26, Security Clause, requires background checks for TMC personnel working in and/or having access to the GAO Headquarters Building. Also, we assume that the government will pay costs for background checks. Is this assumption correct?  Response to Question # 15:  Due to the sensitive nature of information accessible by GAO contractors, all contractor employees working in and /or having access GAO information shall be required to have a background investigation.  In addition, those contractor employees needing access to the GAO headquarters building shall be required to obtain a GAO ID Badge prior to working in the building.  At a minimum, a background check of criminal and credit records covering the last ten years is necessary for placement of a contractor.  GAO will conduct and pay for the background investigation and adjudicate the results.  All necessary security forms must be submitted to GAO prior to commencement of the contract.  Question 16:  RFP Section XI Addendum Custom GAO Clauses, Item 2, Evaluation Criteria, states that the offeror must provide documentation of all work completed within the last three years; however, RFP Item VII, Format of Proposals, requires five past performance references.  Please clarify GAO?s requirement. Response to Question # 16:   Question #16 misstates the requirement of RFP Item VII.  The item does not ?require five past performance references? but ?at least five past performance references?.  There would only be a problem if the contractor did not have at least five clients in the last three years.  Question 17:  RFP Section XI Addendum Custom GAO Clauses, Item 4, Evaluation Criteria states ?the offeror must address all Business Management factors noted in Section (?).? Please provide the missing reference information.  Response to Question # 17:  The missing reference should read ?Section V of the Statement of Work.  Question 18:  In respect to current volumes, can you provide a transactional breakdown by location based on the 4 million air spend?  Response to Question # 18:  The origin and destination location of our employees? travel varies greatly each year because our work is determined by Congressional requests for investigations.  Currently, approximately half of our trips originate from our field offices and half from Headquarters.  We cannot guarantee that this ratio will remain the same for this contract because of the nature of our work assignments.  Question # 19:  Who is the current contractor?  Response to Question # 19:  American Express Travel Services.  Question # 20:  What is the current transaction fee?  Response to Question # 20:  GAO's Travel Management fee under the present contract is proprietary information. Any interested party can, however, refer to American Express prices in the General Services Administration (GSA) Master contract, which is public knowledge.  Whether GAO can release the current contract fee will be determined by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) review now in process. Question # 21:  Which locations are staffed by a full-time agent?  Do field offices support remote printing functionality?  Do all locations require a FTE support?  Response to Question # 21:  Currently, there is a ticketing agent located at the GAO and LOC Headquarters offices.  None of the GAO field offices have remote printing equipment.  No ticketing agent needs to be located on-site in any GAO field offices.   Question # 22:  Which CRS does the current contractor utilize? Which on-line booking engine is currently deployed?  Response to Question # 22:  The current contractor uses the Apollo system as their CRS.  Neither GAO nor LOC uses an on-line booking engine.  Question # 23:  Will there be a pre-proposal conference?  Or an opportunity to visit facilities?  Response to Question # 23:  No.  Question # 24:  What is the transactional detail for hotel by dollar and number of nights?  Response to Question # 24:  Hotels: $ 1.6 million for approximately 13,170 nights (FY 2002 figures).  Question # 25:  What percentage of the hotel bookings processed by the TMC are NOT in conjunction with an airline reservation?  Response to Question # 25:  GAO does not collect the data requested by Question # 25.  Question # 26:  What is the transactional detail for car rentals by dollar and rental days?  Response to Question # 26:  Car rentals through our current TMC is $ 258,000 for approximately 6,486 rental days (FY 2002 figures).  Question # 27:  Are we to include the booking fee charged by Fed Trip (eTravel Initiative) in our quoted transaction fee?  Response to Question # 27:  No.  Question # 28:  Are we to include any fee charged by Gelco to interface the records to the GDS and Fed Trip in our quoted transaction fee?  Response to Question # 28:  No.  Question # 29:  Are we to provide a completed copy of the Sample Reference Check Form for each of our references?  Or, is this just an example of the criteria GAO will use in evaluating an offeror?s past performance.  Response to Question # 29:  No.  The form is a sample of the questions GAO will ask in checking offerors' references.  Question # 30: Are the vendor questions and answers available? And if so, may we get a copy?  Response to Question # 30:  Yes, vendor questions and answers are made available as part of this FedBizOpps notice and copies of all responses will be sent separately via email to offerors requesting copies of the addendum RFP documents. Question # 31:  I understand that revisions to the solicitation are being completed. When re they expected?  Response to Question # 31: Revisions to the RFP are incorporated within this Modification (# 2) to the RFP and in a revised addendum that will be sent to all Offerors requesting additional information.  Question # 32:  Is an extension anticipated?  Response to Question # 32:  Yes, the due date for the receipt of proposal has been extended and stated elsewhere in this Modification (# 2).  Question # 33:  There is a reference to an MOU, however, I cannot find a document labeled as such. Can you clarify where that document is?  Response to Question # 33:  A draft MOU will be included as part of the revised addendum document that will be sent via email to all offerors requesting the additional (addendum) information.  Question # 34:  Could you please provide us with this information (number of transactions and avg. domestic and international ticket prices) so we will be able to provide GAO with the best financial package.  Response to Question # 34:  The GAO has approximately 12,000 trips per year, of which, foreign travel makes up approximately 15 percent.  The average price of domestic tickets is $170.  The average price of foreign tickets is $350 (estimates are based on FY 2002 figures).  The LOC has approximately 3,500 trips per year, of which foreign travel makes up approximately 32 percent.  The average ticket price of domestic tickets is $175.  The average price of foreign tickets is $560 (estimates or based on Fiscal Year 2002 figures).  Question # 35:  Do we understand correctly that you would like an onsite office for both headquarters and the Library of Congress and that the Library of Congress air volume estimate is $750,000? Would you consider our servicing LOC from GAO headquarters or another off-site location?  Response to Question # 35: We have requested that each offeror include as part of their line item cost in the Pricing Schedule, a separate optional cost for an on-site travel agent at the LOC and the GAO headquarters offices.  Our RFP has invited TMCs to provide proposals that they feel will offer GAO and LOC the best services possible.  Question # 36:  Please confirm that we supply the contact information for references only and GAO will survey those references.  Response to Question # 36:  We confirm that your assumption is correct.    Question # 37:  Would you please clarify what the "minimum" and "maximum" amounts for each of the options listed (XI. Addendum Custom GAO Clause page 14, #23) refer to?  Response to Question # 37:  The minimum and maximum for each option year references the ?minimum ($2,000) and maximum not to exceed amount? (1,000,000) the Government will guarantee for services ordered for the base and each option year.  Question # 38:  Please confirm that proposals are due February 12, 2002.  Response to Question # 38:  The due date for the receipt of proposal has been extended and stated elsewhere in this Modification (# 2).  Question # 39:  Please confirm whether Offeror are required to propose FedTrip as its desktop/web based selfbooking tool.  Response to Question # 39:  GAO would like Offeror to include FedTrip as one of its desktop/web based self-booking tools but you may submit multiple offers that include other self-booking tools.  Question # 40:  Please confirm whether Offeror can propose an alternate travel and expense management tool (other than Travel Manager).  Response to Question # 40:  GAO is currently piloting Travel Manager as its travel and expense management tool.  At the present time, we are not interested in any other travel and expense management tool.  Question # 41:  Please confirm whether GAO will participate in adopting the GSA eTravel System once it is procured and available to government agencies.  Response to Question # 41:  GAO has not made a decision on this matter, as the GSA eTravel System is not yet procured or available.  Question # 42:  Please confirm whether GAO will participate in the anticipated GSA Travel Service Solutions (TSS) Multiple Award Schedule for its future travel service contracting requirements and comment on why it is not currently participating in the GSA Master Travel Management Center contract.  Response to Question # 42:  GAO, at this time is only interested in developing and processing its own procurement requirements.  Question # 43:  Please confirm whether onsite office space will be provided at the Library of Congress and/or whether Offeror can service the LOC from the government provided space at GAO HQ.  Response to Question # 43:  If GAO awards a contract for optional on-site services for LOC, office space will be provided at the Library of Congress.  GAO Office space will not be used for on-site services for LOC.  Question # 44:  Please provide the current transaction fees GAO pays for its travel services.  Response to Question # 44: See response to Question #20.

<DESC>Bechtel Nevada is seeking sources that can provide an instrument needed to measure the spectral irradiance of a 150 watt arc lamp for the FABS diagnostic calibration.  In order to make such a calibration, a spectroradiometer is needed.  This device will measure the irradiance of a light source at certain wavelengths specified by the user.  The measurements are then input to a computer, and a graph of the irradiance with respect to wavelength is produced.
The basic desired steps for calibration are as follows:
1.	Use a NIST traceable source to calibrate the system
2.	Replace the calibration source with the arc lamp to be calibrated
3.	Measure the spectral irradiance of the lamp.
System Capability
1.	The system, consisting of a monochromator, detector, and calibration source are NIST traceable to 2%.
2.	The system will cover the wavelength range of 200-3000 nm.
3.	It is a "turn key" system that is simple to use.
4.	Capability to be upgraded at the customer's facility at a later date using already developed and tested accessories.
a.	Modular system that can be quickly and easily changed to meet the requirements of the calibration needed.  Modules are used for testing spectral radiance, irradiance, power, and intensity.  Output modules can also do calibrations of detectors.
5.	stray light of the system is less than 10^-8
6.	The controller has the option of being configured as a stand alone radiometer/photometer without the monochromator.
7.	Source used in system is a NIST traceable source.  It has a 1.5% uncertainty to NIST calibration.  This makes it within our system spec of 2% uncertainty.
a.	Source is a "plug in" source that is locked into alignment mechanically.
8.	Need the option to purchase module for transmisivity of optical components at a later time 
Interested sources should provide a narrative of capabilities along with any product data to Emma Fox at fax number (702) 295-9106.  Other items to include are business size and point of contact information inclusive an email address.  Provide responses no later then February 20, 2003.
