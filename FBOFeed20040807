<SUBJECT>A--Battle Control Center - Experimental
<SOLNBR>R895
<CONTACT>Kevin Psmithe kevin.psmithe@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>The Battle Control Center- Experimental (BCC-X) is the risk reduction tool for the Battle Control System- Mobile (BCS-M). BCS-M is the modernization program for the Control and Reporting Center (CRC). BCC-X, for the first time, allows combat mission ready operators to be involved in the initial stages of systems development and ensures the final product provides the warfighter with improved C2 capabilities. BCC-X plays a major role in the Battle Control System Mobile transformation effort and fills the gap between experimentation/lab efforts, and operational units. BCC-X provides a controlled lab setting in an operational environment necessary for integration and assessment of industry capabilities. Transformation to BCS-M: BCS-M is the end-product of the Theater Air Control Systems deployable Control and Reporting Centers (CRC) transformation to a state-of-the-art C2 battle management system.  It eliminates the legacy hardware and software that have limited the ability of the CRC to exploit C4ISR data available from other in-theater C2 nodes.  BCS-M processes, correlates, and fuses data from multiple sensors / information sources and distributes that data throughout the battlespace. Meeting Warfighter Requirements: The BCS-M provides the full spectrum of tactical-level C2 battle management and execution functions to include the following core competencies: Theater Air Defense Data Link Management Surveillance Combat Identification Airspace Management Air Battle Execution Through the initiative transition process, industry is invited to participate in BCC-X activities and operator assessments by providing their emerging technology in this unique integration environment.  Please consult the BCS-M Initiative Transition Guide for additional information.
