<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Picatinny, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-
5000, on behalf of PM Soldier Weapons, intends to solicit, negotiate and award 
a sole source contract to Quick Charge Corporation (QCC) under the authority 
of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A).  The 
anticipated effort requires a maximum delivery quantity of 450 complete 24 
Volt/40 Amp On-Board Absorbent Glass Matt (OBAGM) battery chargers with 
Temperature Compensation.  QCC is the manufacturer and Intellectual Property 
owner of the 24V OBAGM float charging system with temperature compensation.  
Further, QCC owns the proprietary design and no other contractor could provide 
this commercially available charger with all of the design attributes the 
program requires without obtaining QCCs proprietary data.  QCC is the sole 
contractor possessing the ability to provide this particular configuration 
without introducing significant cost, schedule, and technical risk to the 
program.  These additional risks for another contractor to obtain the design 
details necessary to perform this task are considered to be unacceptable.

Please note that this notice does not constitute a Request For Proposal 
(RFP).  A determination by the U.S. Government not to compete this proposed 
contract action based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the 
discretion of the U.S. Government.  The anticipated award timeframe for this 
action is 4QFY11.

<DESC>EXCEPTION TO THE FAIR OPPORTUNITY PROCESS
FAR 16.505(b)(2)

This Exception the Fair Opportunity Process is executed by the Naval Medical Logistics Command, Fort Detrick, MD for supplies or services specified below.   

The proposed vendor is the only awardee under the available DSCP contracts, per the Memorandum of Understanding between NMLC and DSCP approved on 03 June 2009, capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.  

Specified below are the vendor, the required supplies or services, total estimated dollar value, and the rationale for the unique or highly specialized nature of the equipment:

NNMC Bethesda has a requirement for a radiographic/fluoroscopic system with an estimated total value of $340,000, including installation turnkey, to be procured with FY11 OP funds.

The radiographic/fluoroscopic system shall be permanent (not mobile), digital, and shall be intended for general purpose imaging.
  The system shall have at least a 65kW x-ray generator and a ceiling-mounted tube configuration.  The table shall be capable of tilting 30 into Trendelenburg position and 90 into reverse Trendelenburg position and shall be capable of supporting patients weighing up to 500 pounds.  The system shall be capable of providing pulsed fluoroscopy, ranging from 4 frames per second (fps) to at least 15 fps, in order to reduce dose as appropriate while imaging dynamic organs.  The system shall include a vertical wall stand, a cassette/grid holder for cross-table studies, and a DVD recorder.  The system shall be DICOM compatible and shall include an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).  The system shall be compatible with the radiographic/fluoroscopic system in place at the National Intrepid Center of Excellence (NICoE) in order to provide consistent care as patients with traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder are imaged and transferred at the Bethesda campus.
  The system shall have the capability to be upgraded based on clinical and workflow needs.  The vendor shall be able to provide turnkey installation.

Of the available vendor models that offer a general-purpose radiographic/fluoroscopic system, the GE Precision 500D is the only system that meets the minimum requirements of the government.  The GE Precision 500D is compatible with other radiographic/fluoroscopic systems installed on the Bethesda campus, as well as compatible with other radiographic equipment at the command.  There are Philips radiographic/fluoroscopic systems installed on the campus, but there have been significant issues with service call response time and the resulting downtimes have delayed the delivery of patient care.
 There is no current MOU in place to order from another vendor that could meet the needs of the government.  Therefore, it is not possible bo do a competitive competition with Phillips. GE has provided satisfactory service call responses and is the only vendor that offers a system that meets the minimum requirements of the government.

The contracting office will document the rationale for the placement and price of each order, including the basis for award and the rationale for any tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost considerations in making the award decision.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation's Upper Colorado Regional Office intends to issue a solicitation for a firm-fixed price contract to replace the Unit and Station Service Switchgear at its Elephant Butte Power Plant Facility.  The facility is located approximately 5 miles east of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico in Sierra County.  It is anticipated that a full-and-open competition in accordance with FAR Part 15 procedures, with an intent to award without discussions, will be conducted due to recent market research suggesting insufficient small businesses qualified to successfully perform this requirement.  The solicitation is projected to be released sometime in July 2011, but is subject to change.
The designated NAICS code for this requirement is 335313 - Switchgear and Switchgear Accessories Manufacturing.  The principal components of the work include, but are not limited to the following tasks:  
A.	Furnish and install new 15-kV (operating at 6.9-kV) unit switchgear assembly.B.	Furnish and install new 4.76-kV (operating at 2.3-kV) station service switchgear assembly. C.	Furnish and install new 5-kV insulated power cables.D.	Furnish and install 600V insulated cables.E.	Furnish and install electrical conduits.F.	Remove and dispose of existing electrical equipment and materials. G.	Core drilling concrete in power plant for new conduits.
The estimated price range for the magnitude of construction, including both the supply and installation of excitation systems, is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  It is anticipated that any resulting contract will contain two separate bid/price  schedules, one for the supply of the switchgear equipment, and another for the installation thereof.  Therefore, supply contract clauses will apply to the former, and construction clauses to the latter.  100% performance and payment bonds will be required.  A site visit will be scheduled and indicated in the future solicitation for interested vendors.  Drawings will be provided to properly vetted vendor representatives prior to the scheduled site visit. 
Interested potential offerors are encouraged to add themselves to the "Interested Vendors" list for this presolicitation notice.  All questions concerning this presolicitation notice should be directed, via e-mail only, to Kent Munro at kmunro@usbr.gov.  Phone calls will not be returned.  This is a presolicitation only, and is not a request for bids or offers.  This requirement is subject to change at any time and may be cancelled without further notice.

This change from the existing downconverter to the RT Logicdownconverter will also require software GUI changes. This requires a Telemetrix 400FCBase Chassis and System Integration; an S-Band Agile Downconverter; system-specificcabling for interconnnetion of the new chasis within existing rack; engineering effortfor documentation updates (BOM), drawings, user guide, etc., along with systemintegration and testing.NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the replacement items and repair and modifications from RTLogic, Inc. of Colorado Springs, Colorado. RT Logic Inc. designed and manufactured theTSIM for Wallops Flight Facility.  RT Logic Inc. has all the necessary documentation(manuals, prints, etc.) to perform the upgrade/modifications to the TDRSS Simulator(TSIM). Due to copyrights and propriety materials no other company can perform thisupgrade/modification. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All communicationsshall be written or via email to Joan L. Murden, (757) 824-1352 orJoan.L.Murden@nasa.gov.  The technical representative is Mr. Garry Fisher at (7570824-1661  Garry.W.Fisher@nasa.gov. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory, P.O. Box 500, Top of BH Observatory Road at 13, Milton, MA 02186-0998 for the following requirement: This requirement is intended to provide all personnel, equipment, materials, services and facilities (except as otherwise specified), to perform the following: The Government will provide necessary maintenance (ASOS) required for the continuous function of Government owned equipment located at the observatory. The contractor shall record data and remarks on forms B-16 (Surface Weather Observations), F-6 (Preliminary Local Climatological Data) and B-83B (Record of Reference-Climatological Station Observations) for previous 24 hours, download ASOS data, compare ASOS data with other older technologies for the previous 24 hours, and update computer files including documents and spreadsheets, for the NOAA National Weather Service, Observations &amp; Facilities Branch, 630 Johnson Ave., Bohemia, New York. All work to be in accordance with the Statement of Work included in the solicitation. The period of performance is July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012, with priced options for four (4) additional years. Deliverables to be delivered to NOAA National Weather Service, Observations &amp; Facilities Branch, 630 Johnson Ave., Bohemia, New York. In order to comply with the debt collection improvement act of 1966, all contractors must be registered in the central contractor registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a federal contract. For information regarding registration in CCR contact the CCR website at www.ccr.gov/index.cfm. Authority: 41 USC 253(c)(1). The FSC for this is R427 and the NAICS Code is 541990, small business size standard is $6.5 million. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement. The Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory is the sole provider for climatological weather observations and services at this site. The Federal government has stated that climate change is a national priority. This site is the only site where climate data has been collected in the same location for over 125 years. The cost to maintain this service is minimal for the support of climatic change research. The Blue Hill Observatory is home to the oldest continuously monitored meteorological records in North America, and its unique in the fact that the measurement site has changed very little since its foundation in 1885.
<p>Data gathering at this site was performed by National Weather Service personnel using the space (and utilities) provided by the Blue Hill Observatory Science Center until May of 1999. The NWS changed the nature of its presence at the site from that of NWS employees to a contract, and due to some facts that still apply today, the NWS asked Eastern Administrative Service Center (EASC) to enter into a sole source type of contract with the representatives of the Blue Hill Observatory Science Center.</p>
<p>In a letter dated January 29, 1999 Dr. William Minsinger, President of the Blue Hill Science Center expressed their uneasiness at the prospect of non-NWS personnel using their facilities. In other words, letting contract personnel with which they are not familiar with into their land, facilities, etc., was not an option they felt comfortable with. Because of this, in his letter Dr. Minsinger also indicated the willingness of the Science Center to obtain the contract themselves to take on the responsibilities of the observational work. These are some of the items, still relevant today, for pursuing a sole source contract with the Blue Hill Observatory Science Center as opposed to an "outsider" contract: <br />&bull; The Blue Hill Observatory Science center has a long term agreement with the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (owners of the building and former known as the Metropolitan District Commission) to provide all public programming in the newly renovated facility. This organization also provides the maintenance for the building and the grounds that surround it. <br />&bull; Access to and from the building where observations are taken is controlled by the Science Center, and have been provided freely until now. For contract personnel access to and from the Observatory would become an issue, including issuance of passes, badges, separate keys for those areas of the building we use, security, etc. <br />&bull; Another site is not acceptable as the whole purpose of this exercise is to maintain the 125 year record and its site intact. <br />&bull; The site has gone through renovations, and the Science Center Museum is now open. This observer on duty introduces climate measurement concepts to visitors to the Center. Anybody other than a NWS employee or observer provided by the Blue Hill Observatory Science Center is not acceptable.<br />&bull; The hiring of contract personnel will, by the very nature of the Observatory, necessitate that adequate training be provided by the NWS in the operation and maintenance of the unique equipment used at the site.</p>
<p>These issues became irrelevant in 1999, including that of training, as the Science Center identified an observer with over 40 years of experience at Blue Hill, and two more part time meteorologists as ready to maintain the observational work for them, if the contract was awarded to the Blue Hill Observatory Science Center.</p>
<p>Finally, and to quote Dr. Minsinger, "We are most willing to continue to support the current NWS observer with the current arrangement. However we feel that any other arrangement in which the Blue Hill Observatory Science Center could not directly participate in or indeed provide the observational work at the Observatory would prove entirely unsatisfactory." These feelings are still prevalent today.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is the recommendation of the Eastern Region Headquarters that at this time the NWS enter once again into a sole source type of contract with the representatives of the Blue Hill Observatory Science Center.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by 4:00 P.M. June 28, 2011 will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Evidence must be provided of ability to perform the required analysis. Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Linda.Mullen@noaa.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to solicit, on a sole source basis, the purchase of up to 13 MH60S Aircraft OAMCM Interconnect Cables from Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (SAC), 6900 Main Street, Stratford, CT  06615-9129.
This Interconnect Cables will support the continued development of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, as defined in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). SAC is and has been the sole developer of the MH-60S Helicopter from the programs inception.  Given the complexity of the system and the level of system knowledge required to work through the complete development, test, and evaluation, SAC is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the engineering and design services to provide these Interconnect Cables.
 The use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and there are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost, significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government.

Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities with SAC should contact the company directly or visit their supplier website at http://www.utc.com/About+UTC/Suppliers+%2526+Partners.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The US Geological Survey,  Central Geologic Hazards Team, Advanced National Seismic Network (ANSS) Project has an ongoing need for software maintenance and development in support of the ANSS mission to provide rapid estimate of global earthquake location magnitude, and other source properties and support of the HYDRA and Earthquake systems.
The USGS, Central Geologic Hazards Team, Advanced National Seismic Network (ANSS) Project is improving the completeness, reliability, and timeliness of seismic information available from the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC), which acts as the National Operation Center (NOC) for the ANSS Program.  This information serves earthquake hazard responders, public officials, the media, the seismological research and earthquake engineering communities, and the general public.  The ANSS Project is an integrated effort including the extension and maintenance of real-time national and global seismograph networks; operational support for automated seismic processing, analyst review, and catalog production; development of a complete automated processing and analyst support system; and operational personnel.  The ANSS Program involves the exchange of real-time data among many cooperating institutions including the NEIC.  Because of seismic monitoring and rapid response aspects, the ANSS/GSN and cooperative seismic data must be received and processed, and earthquake products distributed 24 hours/day, 7 days/week.
This effort requires custom real-time programming of the field processors (at the stations) and interface software at cooperating data centers, handling telemetry on satellite and terrestrial links under TCP/IP protocols, and acquiring, processing, managing, archiving, and distributing data at the NEIC.  This task is significantly complicated by the fact that a variety of different types of stations (using different types of data acquisition systems) are received in real-time either directly or mediated by a variety of data center hardware and software and received over various private and public wide area computer networks.
The contractor works independently on systems that are very complex to analyze, plan, program, and operate.  The contractor participates in all phases of planning, system design, prototyping, development, testing, documentation, and software maintenance.  
This requirement is for performance based services.  The Government does not intend to use Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 12.  
The performance period is for a base year and four one-year options for a total of five years.  The Request for Proposals (RFP)/Solicitation No. G11PS00301 will be available on or about July 13, 2011.  
Interested parties may access a copy or download the document by going to https://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/.  Requests for a hard copy of the solicitation will not be accepted.  Telephone requests for the RFP will not be accepted.  Interested parties must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) https://www.ccr.gov to be considered for this contract award.  Offers for this RFP will only be accepted by mail.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Central Issue Warehouses, Support Supply Activity Warehouses, and General Purpose Warehouses located in the state of Georgia.  The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Cody Cotten, 817-886-1077; or by e-mail at cody.d.cotten@usace.army.mil .  FOR INFORMATION ONLY: FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Business Process. USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but are also the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned. Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization. Of those forty one, Fort Worth District (SWF) has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Warrior in Transition (WT) facilities, Reception Station Barracks, Drill Sergeant Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses, Support Supply Activity Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The IDIQ contracts for Barracks are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) and Northeast ( CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion. The IDIQ contracts for Warehouses are located in East and West of the Mississippi River and have been distributed accordingly.<BR>SCOPE OF WORK: <BR><BR>Central Issue Warehouses:  The primary mission of the CIFs is to provide a single point for receipt, storage, issue, exchange, and return of all authorized organizational clothing and individual equipment items at the specified United States Army Installation.  CIF facilities provide storage capabilities combined with office space, used in the administration of issuing soldiers equipment as needed.  The facilities support open storage for deployment functions as necessary by the Army Unit occupying the building.  The functional and operational requirements of the CIW require that the design be based on the characteristics of the material being handled and stored, the volume and flow pattern through the facility, and the inventory pattern.  Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary as required to meet project specific requirements.<BR>Support Supply Activity Warehouses: SSAs will provide a facility capable of storing and maintaining the Army prepositioned stocks (APS) and items required for active duty operation.  The facility is similar to a parts wholesale warehouse.  The functional and operational requirements of the SSA require that the design be based on the Adapt-Build Model standard design.    Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will not vary.<BR>General Purpose Warehouses: GPWs will be capable of supporting the storage of various equipment and materials, up to a Moderate-hazard level.  GPW facilities may have substantially differing design and operational requirements in order to meet the Armys needs on a worldwide basis.  The facility type will provide an acceptable relationship between actual equipment dimensions, performance characteristics and the building dimensions.  GPWs are intended to be similar both functionally and technically to private sector industrial warehouses  Supporting facilities include utilities; electric service; water, sewer, gas; paving, walks, curbs and gutters; storm drainage; site improvements and information systems.  Access for persons with disabilities will be provided in public areas.  Comprehensive building and furnishings related interior design services are required.  Comprehensive warehouse pallet and racking systems related to warehouse functional design services are required.  Air conditioning will be provided in administrative areas, and warehouse areas will be ventilated and heated.  Supporting work includes fire protection sprinkler and fire detection systems of the warehouses.  <BR>It is the intent of Government to issue design-build and adapt-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region.<BR>CONTRACT INFORMATION:   <BR>This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation.  The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will select no more than 5 to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process.  <BR>In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.  <BR>The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Phase I  Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach;  Phase II  Volume I: Building Functional, Aesthetics and Space; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; Site Design; and Sustainability Requirements.  Volume II:  Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Utilization of Small Business Concerns.  All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price.  <BR>Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 18 Oct 2010 under solicitation number W9126G-11-R-0054.  This procurement is Unrestricted.  Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 18 Nov 2010 (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction).  The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million.<BR><BR>MATOC: <BR>The Government intends to award at least two and up to five contracts as a result of this solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to award only the initial task as a C-type, stand alone contract if it is determined that firms responding do not have the past performance, required bonding, or demonstrated experience for a contract of this magnitude.  The remaining capacity would then be re-advertised as a full and open competition.  Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.  It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance. The Government reserves the right to award additional contracts for the MATOC pool from a separate solicitation.   Other solicitations for similar work in this same region may be advertised to meet the Governments needs for this facility type.  THIS SOLICITATION IS SET-ASIDE FOR HUBZone.<BR><BR>The total estimated contract capacity is $100,000,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.  The minimum guarantee will be $ 2,500.  The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders.   The minimum task order limitation is $1,000,000.  The maximum task order limitation for the contracts is $10,000,000.  The maximum combination of orders is $15,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  Task orders issued as a result of this contract will be firm-fixed price.  <BR>The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening.  Proposals from Large businesses must comply with FAR Clause 52.219-9, regarding the requirement for a Subcontracting Plan.  The Fort Worth District goals (expressed as a percentage of the contractors total planned subcontract amount) are as follows:  Small Business 70.0%; Small Disadvantaged Business 6.2%; Women-Owned Small Business 7.0%; HUBZone Small Business 9.8%, Veteran-Owned Small Business 3.5%; and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business 2%.  Plans and specifications will not be provided in a hard paper copy.    Contractors may view and/or download this solicitation and all amendments from FedBizOps.<BR> Because of the size of our solicitations, you should not attempt to view them online.  Rather download them to your local hard drive and then open them.  Use of the FedBizOps website requires prior registration at https://www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is soliciting Small Business contractors for a construction project for Bulkhead Repairs, Block Island Harbor of Refuge, Rhode Island. <br><br>The work of this project consists of repairing an existing steel sheet pile bulkhead and timber wharf at the Block Island HOR (locally known as "Old Harbor"), Rhode Island. The existing T and are both approximately 250 in lengths. The existing steel bulkhead is to be abandoned in place and a new steel sheet pile bulkhead is to be installed behind it. The stone revetment fronting the existing bulkhead will also be repaired, requiring new stone to supplement the material already existing in the revetment. Also, the deck and framing of the existing timber wharf in front of the bulkhead will be removed and replaced. Existing timber piles are in good condition and will be reused. Due to the proximity of adjacent buildings, it is anticipated that much of the work will be performed from floating platform or jack barge. However, land equipment will be required for excavation and movement of materials. It should also be noted that space for staging of equipment and materials on site is extremely limited. Transport of materials and equipment to the island via the Block Island Ferry is limited and therefore the contractor may need to make other arrangements to bring materials and equipment to the project site. <br><br>This solicitation will be available on or about April 21, 2011 and will be available for downloading by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov). In order to view this solicitation, prospective contractors are required to self register their firm with Federal Business Opportunities (Go to http://www.fbo.gov and register now under Vendor/Citizens). Amendments, if any, to this solicitation will be made available at the https://www.fbo.gov Internet site. Neither telephonic, mailed nor faxed requests will be accepted. Registrants are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the registration list. This procurement is set aside for Small Business firms. The applicable NAICS code is 237990 with a Small Business Size Standard of $33,500,000. The estimated cost of the contract is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. All responsible sources may submit a bid, which will be considered by the New England District. <br><br>

<DESC>The Marine Design Center (MDC) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) intends to initiate a Request For Quotation (RFQ) to provide labor, materials, and service to dry-dock and repair the inland waters welded steel crane barge (CEMVR Hercules).  From the final design package, the contractor will repair and modify the structure, test and deliver the ready and mission capable barge intended to serve the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Illinois Waterway Office, Rock Island District in Peoria, IL in support of its navigation support mission on the Illinois Waterway system.  The HERCULES is a fully revolving floating crane. The crane is a Manitowoc model 4600 Vicon Series 3 platform mounted on a barge, 200'x 70' X 10'-0". The vessel's primary mission is to provide maintenance for the Illinois Waterway Project.

<RESPDATE>063011
<CONTACT>Leisa A. Zemba, Contract Specialist, Phone 3218540974, Email leisa.zemba@patrick.af.mil
<DESC>The Patrick Air Force Base 45th Contracting Squadron is seeking sources with the capability to fill the requirement for the 45th Weather Squadron (45 WS) to evaluate the performance of the National Hurricane Center (NHC) Wind Speed Probability Forecast product. The 45 WS makes extensive use of this NHC product in advising operational customers of hurricane impacts including whether to let space launch vehicles and payloads ride-out the hurricane at the launch pad or roll-back to shelter. The former avoids costly delays in space launch schedule, but increases risk to the space launch vehicle and payload, while the latter is safer and causes costly delays in space launch schedule. The 45 WS also uses the NHC product to help customers schedule preparations to mitigate the risks from tropical cyclones at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station/Kennedy Space Center/Patrick Air Force Base (CCAFS/KSC/PAFB). Preparations cost funds and work hours diverted from normal duties, but not being prepared risks personnel safety and resource protection. Finally, 45 WS uses the NHC product to help customers make evacuation decisions, including timing for setting the various Hurricane Conditions for CCAFS/KSC/PAFB. The performance of the old NHC wind speed product was previously evaluated, (see attachments entitled "...Analysis to Be Duplicated" and "...Background") but NHC introduced a new improved model for operational use in 2010 hurricane season. The significant improvements in the new model mean that the old performance evaluation is no longer representative of the current operational product. To fulfill this requirement, the successful contractor shall have the capability to document the performance of the new NHC wind speed probability forecasts that began in the 2010 hurricane season for tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea, threatening the United States and Antigua. Since this analysis will likely be extended in future years as more hurricane seasons occur and larger sample sizes become for improved performance evaluation, the successful contractor shall also design the project for easy addition of more tropical cyclones. The following are those goals to be accomplished in the achievement of this requirement:<br />&nbsp;<br />1) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">First Goal</span>: Verify the performance of the cumulative wind probability forecasts. This verification will include the following six factors: 1) verify the cumulative forecasts for all land tropical cyclones threatening the Gulf Coast and the East Coast of the U.S., 2) verify these forecasts for at least 2005-2011, 3) include handling of the &lsquo;X' forecasts (&lt;0.5% but &gt;0%), 4) verify the forecasts for three time intervals: up to closest approach, after closest approach, and for the entire forecast period, 5) determine if the performance for land threatening hurricanes for east central Florida centered on CCAFS/KSC/PAFB, is significantly different from the entire Gulf and East U.S. coastline, and 6) use the new National Hurricane Center forecast model implemented operationally in the 2010 hurricane season applied retroactively to previous seasons if available. Land threatening hurricanes are those for which the NHC wind probability forecasts have values of 1% or greater for any of the forecast points location on the Gulf or East U.S. coast. Design the project for easy addition of more tropical cyclones, such as from future hurricane seasons.<br />2) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second Goal</span>: Document the performance of the new NHC interval wind probability forecasts with the same six factors as listed for the cumulative forecast documentation listed above.<br />3) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Goal</span>: Determine and document if the performance of the new NHC cumulative and interval forecasts for hurricanes threatening Antigua is significantly different from the entire Gulf and East U.S. coastline.<br />4) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fourth Goal</span>: Develop, tune, and verify a two-dimensional interpretation tool for the new interval and cumulative NHC wind speed probability forecasts. The two-dimensional tool converts the probability forecast into five plain-language categories (very low, low, moderate, high, and very high) based on the forecast probability at a point of interest and that probability relative to the rest of the forecast. The Verification must be done on data independent from the development and tuning. More detail can be found under the attached document entitled: '2-D Interpretation Model'.
<p>It is the Government's intention to set aside this requirement under a small business set-aside program. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 541990. The size standard for NAICS 541990 is $7M. The Government is interested in all qualified and experienced small businesses, including 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses that, in the Government's opinion, are capable of performing this requirement. In the event that no qualified and experienced small business responds, it will be the Government's intention to consider all other sources. The Government requests that interested parties submit a brief description of their company's business size (i.e. annual revenues and employee size), business status (i.e., 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, small business), and a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers. The Government will use this information in determining its small business set-aside decision.</p>
<p>Sources should submit a brief capabilities statement in response to this notice. The response should be no more than 3 typed pages and must address the following areas: 1) provide a description of the firm's background in meteorology, 2) demonstrate an understanding of the National Hurricane Center's products, 3) demonstrate an understanding of statistical analysis that shows a capability to conduct an evaluation modeled after the previous evaluation of the NHC products (see attachment entitled, "...Analysis To Be Duplicated' and &lsquo;...Background"), especially verification of probability forecasting and bootstrapping/resampling, and 4) a description of recent and relevant company experience related to the requirements outlined in this announcement, to include publications and reports. <br /><br />Submit capabilities statement to: Attn: Leisa Zemba, Bldg 1704, Hangar Rd, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL 32920-2200 or email to leisa.zemba@patrick.af.mil. Responses are due no later than 30 June 2010. Direct all questions to the attention of Leisa Zemba at 321 854-0974.</p>
<p>This sources sought is NOT a Request For Proposal (RFP) and does NOT commit the Government to pay for information requested, issuance of a solicitation, or award of a contract. This effort is considered Commercial in nature and any resultant RFP/Contract will be issued/awarded IAW FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.</p>

<CONTACT>Fiscal IT, Contracting Officer, Fax 304-480-7203, Email psb3@bpd.treas.gov
<DESC>Purpose<br /><br />The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to survey the commercial marketplace for viable cloud based solutions to replace or augment the Financial Management Service's (FMS) and Bureau of the Public Debt's (BPD) current Messaging and Collaboration systems. <br /><br />Background<br /><br />In September 2009, FMS and BPD initiated a joint effort to identify opportunities for improvements in their respective IT infrastructures. This effort resulted in the sponsorship of the Fiscal IT Project, and specifically, four recommendations:<br /><br />1. Consolidate data centers and infrastructure.<br />2. Create a single corporate governing body for Fiscal IT.<br />3. In-source select contractor functions.<br />4. Consolidate application development methodologies and infrastructure.<br /><br />This RFI is specific to the Messaging and Collaboration Infrastructures and supports recommendation '#1' above.<br /><br />In support of Fiscal IT and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mandates, FMS and BPD are evaluating current premise, cloud and hybrid based messaging and collaboration based technologies and considering alternate systems for future deployment. The intent is to take advantage of advancements in technology while benefiting from competitive industry trends. By acquiring state of the art email and collaboration services, FMS and BPD will equip and empower its employees and increase effective interaction with customers and business partners. The resulting capabilities should act as a catalyst to accelerate and improve the delivery of mission goals and services in the future.<br /><br />For the purposes of this effort, the definition of Cloud Computing will follow the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) definition (see Note 1) of a "model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configuration computing resources (e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction." Likewise, we will use the NIST definition of Software as a Service (SaaS): "The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a client interface such as a web browser (e.g. web-based email). The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.<br /><br />Requirement<br /><br />The objective of this RFI is to identify integrated SaaS service offerings that are candidate replacement technologies for the existing Fiscal Service Enterprise. The replacement technology must provide the following general functionalities:<br /><br />&bull; Email<br />&bull; Group based business accounts - these accounts provide for business functionality to receive email requests, route and track work amongst specific business focused teams.<br />&bull; Contact Management<br />&bull; Calendar and Scheduling<br />&bull; Work Flow<br />&bull; Document management and versioning<br />&bull; Chat and Web Conferencing capabilities<br />&bull; E-Discovery and Litigation Hold<br />&bull; Integrated with Records Management Processes<br />&bull; Archive, backup and disaster recovery<br />&bull; Collaboration Tools and Technology (Wikis, blogs, team rooms, document repositories, etc).<br />&bull; Ability to simultaneously create and edit documents/spreadsheets across multiple users.<br />&bull; Solution Installation and Administration<br />&bull; Training.<br /><br />Other desired (but not required) functionalities include:<br /><br />&bull; Hosting of management servers to support mobile devices (e.g. Blackberries, iPhones, Droids based phones, etc).<br />&bull; eFax services<br />&bull; List Server Administration.<br /><br />These functions must be provided in accordance with federally prescribed guidelines for security, privacy, and accessibility. Additionally, the solution should be highly integrated, robust, offer multiple aspects of collaboration, and demonstrate sufficient flexibility to be adapted as business mission needs change.<br /><br />Qualified Contractors are encouraged to provide product information and offer approaches that merit further consideration. Interested parties should provide a capabilities package to include:<br /><br />1. The name and location of your company and contact information. Please <br />ensure contact information includes the name of the point of contact, email <br />address, and telephone number should the Government have questions <br />regarding individual responses.<br /><br />2. Product descriptions/specifications that fully describe operational <br />functionalities and infrastructure requirements, to include concepts for <br />deployment and training.<br /><br />3. Prior/current experience providing contract services to federal <br />agencies within the last three years, including contract number, organization supported, whether performance was as a prime or subcontractor, total contract value and a Government point of contact with current telephone number and email address.<br /><br />All responses will be evaluated for merit and technical feasibility. Additional information or demos may be requested to support an ongoing requirement analysis which will incorporate findings and recommendations for a cost effective, user-friendly and highly-productive system. All questions, inquiries and responses must be in writing. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.<br /><br />This notice does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised their response is not a submission that will be considered for contract award. All interested parties will be required to respond to any resultant solicitation separately from their response to this sources sought notice.<br /><br />Responses to this request must be submitted no later than 2:00 p.m. ET on June 30, 2011. The following file extensions are not allowable, and application materials/data submitted with these extensions cannot be considered:<br /><br />.bat, .cmd, .com, .exe, .pif, .rar, .scr, .vbs, .hta, .cpl, and .zip files.<br /><br />Microsoft Office compatible and PDF documents are acceptable.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: Any future solicitation resulting from this requirement will NOT reference this Request for Information.<br /><br />Responses to this request must be emailed to psb3@bpd.treas.gov - Attention: Fiscal IT.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is conducting market research to support the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) requirement for a wire fatigue tester.</p>
<p>The FDA is seeking business sources, including total small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and 8(a) certified companies. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort:</p>
<p>The government is seeking capability statements from small business manufacturing companies that can provide a wire fatigue testers with temperature controlled water bath necessary components permitting immediate use.</p>
<p>The instrument shall be equivalent to the salient characteristics described herein.</p>
<p>&bull; Capable of variable high speed rotation (35,000 RPM desired). <br />&bull; Rotation clockwise and counterclockwise.<br />&bull; Temperature controlled water bath capable of maintaining 37OC.<br />&bull; Capable of testing a wide range of wire diameters including 0.5mm.<br />&bull; Available optional attachments for different wire diameter sizes.<br />&bull; Ease of operation to include centering of small wires. <br />&bull; Wire break detection and cycle counter. <br />&bull; Available attachments for stents is desired.<br />&bull; Wire driven by chucks at both ends.<br />&bull; Distance between chucks is adjustable.</p>
<p>The offeror shall furnish sufficient technical information necessary for the Government to conclusively determine that the offered instrument and components meet the technical requirements identified above.</p>
<p>Many medical devices that CDRH researches and for which CDRH provides regulatory guidance contain specialty metal components that are subject to cyclical mechanical loading. Over time, this mechanical loading can lead to device failure through a process known as fatigue. To ensure the safety of implanted devices, such as coronary stents, endovascular grafts, septal occluders, inferior vena cava filters, and numerous dental and orthopedic implants, a complete understanding of the fatigue properties of their specialty metals components is critically important. One of the simplest and most cost effective ways to study fatigue in specialty metal components for medical devices is to perform wire fatigue testing in a rotating beam tester. High speed rotating beam wire fatigue testers would allow CDRH to conduct fatigue research which will assist in the prediction of device safety. The main focus of this research will be on emerging fatigue testing methodologies including Fatigue to Fracture (FtF). FtF is a test method which could provide more predictive information on device failure and shorter test times when compared to the current Test to Success methodology. High speed rotating beam wire fatigue testers will provide CDRH with the research capabilities in order to begin investigations on FtF methodology which will lead to improved long term durability and safety for a broad range of medical devices.<br />These testers will be used as part of a research project for durability testing for specialty metal components in devices. The results of this project will help ensure the safety of a number of implanted medical devices with specialty metal components. High speed rotating beam wire fatigue testers are needed to complete the research proposed in this project.</p>
<p>Firms believing they can meet the requirementss to the above specifications are encouraged to respond electronically with no less than the following information:</p>
<p>&bull; Business name, DUNS number, business address, business website, business size status (i.e., SB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HUBZone SB, SDB, WOSB, LB), point of contact name, mailing address (if different from business address), phone number and email address;<br />&bull; Sufficient descriptive literature that unequivocally demonstrates that offered products meet or exceed above specifications.<br />&bull; At a minimum provide the following:<br />All descriptive material necessary for the government to determine whether the product offered meets the technical requirements including: technical specifications, descriptive material, literature, brochures and other information, which demonstrates the capabilities of the contractor to meet the requirement. Indicate whether the organization is the manufacturer of the items or authorized reseller.<br />&bull; Though this is not a request for quote, informational pricing must be submitted.</p>

<DESC>Introduction:
<p>The USDA Fores Service intends to negotiate a contract for Centralized Image Segmentation Sofware Acquisition and Associated Maintenance.<br />The Image Segmentation is an automated process for delineating land cover as seen on imagery into manageable units which can then be used for analysis by land resource managers. Image segmentation entails dividing digital imagery into cohesive units or regions based on both spectral and contextual spatial information. Traditionally, the process of delineating land cover into manageable units has been accomplished through the use of aerial photography which was photo interpreted, and then hand digitized into a digital format suitable for a Geographic Information System (GIS). Image segmentation has replaced this process as a cost effective solution to an important information need in the US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service (USFS). <br />Background and Objectives:</p>
<p>The current primary software application used in the USFS for image segmentation is very effective, but the cost prohibits many who want to use it from acquiring the software. Centralizing services will allow greater access. There are dozens of image segmentation software programs that may produce image segments comparable to image segments generated with the current image segmentation software. The intent of the competitive solicitation described is to acquire enterprise level image segmentation software for USFS users.</p>
<p>The scope of this contract will include purchase of the image segmentation software application licenses and off-site maintenance consisting of:</p>
<p>Access to new versions of software <br />Upgrade support and assistance <br />Certifications for the latest IT environments <br />Issue escalation and management of urgent priority ases <br />Remote problem diagnosis and fixing <br />License management, bug tracking and fixing, <br />Software patches and distribution, and maintenance releases.</p>
<p>Services/Functionality Required:<br />The USFS will purchase a minimum of 10 licenses of image segmentation software from the chosen vendor. All product submissions must: <br />Provide a minimum of 8 hours of support. Support requirements include: <br />oInstallation Assistance <br />Training <br />Be compatible with Windows XP and Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Software Maintenance: The vendor will provide software support consisting of the following:</p>
<p>Provide assistance with installation and use problems that RSAC personnel are unable solve. The software provider will be required to solve all functionality issues.</p>
<p>Provide the USFS with all enhancements, upgrades, and other updates associated with the software in accordance with the period of performance specified in the contract.</p>
<p>Provide yearly maintenance agreement in the form of technical support for the products. The maintenance agreement will be paid on a yearly basis with an option extension to renew for a total of 5 years, including the basic year.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for proposals.</p>

<DESC>Naval Facilities Engineering Command Northwest, Whidbey Island, WA is interested in sources to provide retractable hook cable support arresting gear system with a means to store the arresting gear hook cable below the surface of the runway when aircraft arrestments are not anticipated. It must also lift the hook cable into position (two to three inches above the runway surface) when aircraft arrestments are anticipated. The primary systems supplied with the hook cable support system are:
. A mechanical system to raise and hold the hook cable above the runway surface.
. A secondary mechanical system to absorb the shock of an aircraft rolling over the cable support block.
. A lowering system to lower the hook cable below the runway surface to prevent incidental aircraft or runway damage when the arresting system is not being used.
.
 An electrical system to operate, monitor and troubleshoot the hook cable support system.
. A heater system to permit cold weather operation.
The system needs to be designed so that the mechanical system holds the hook cable in the up position, and the lowering system overcomes the mechanical system to lower the hook cable. Due to this design, if electrical power is lost or if the lowering system fails, the hook cable will return to the up position and an arrestment can be performed.

The retractable hook cable support system needs to have been tested and approved by an agency of the US DoD.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT notice. <br /><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Detroit District, is seeking potential firms that have the capability to execute a construction project at the Fox River Dams in Wisconsin,  that shall include, but not limited to, clearing and grubbing of approximately 800 lineal feet of levee along Depere Dam's Eastern Embankment located in Depere, WI. Root balls of approximately 50 trees over 3" in diameter will need to be removed to a depth of 3 feet and filled with cohesive material. Most of the trees are less than 2' in diameter with some greater than 2' in diameter.  The remainder of the site will need to be stripped 18", re-graded and topped with 4" of topsoil and seed. Additional cohesive fill will be needed to achieve the required slopes.  All fill will need to be compacted per dam safety requirements.  Approximately 40% of the total work involves removal of trees and filling cavities with clay.  The remaining 60% involves stripping of top soil and restoring the dam embankment.  All of this will involves dam safety issues and will require strict adherence to safety standards.  The only access to the embankment is over a small navigation lock or via water transport.  Any heavy equipment or construction materials will need to be brought to the site via barge. <br /> <br />The contract will have a 90 days completion requirement. <br /><br />The estimated award date of the contract is 15 August 2011. <br /> <br />The estimated cost of construction is between $100,000 and $500,000.<br /><br />The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990, which has a size standard of $33,500,000 in average annual receipts.  <br /> This is NOT a request for proposal.

<DESC>Research is needed for the development and prototyping of an advanced personal learning capability which is being pursued by DASD(R)/Training Readiness and Strategy (TRS) - Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative, in response to the White House request for USD (P&R) to take the lead on the application of learning technologies in DoDEA schools and elsewhere.

The overarching goal is to take the learning concepts from the 1965 Project Head Start program and DARPAs Education Dominance program and implement them using a customized, individual-based approach that leverages todays networking and computing technologies.  This modern application is envisioned to provide a persistent, asynchronous 24/7, personalized learning associate (PLA) for students across the entire learning continuum.
  

This future learning ecosystem will provide training and learning environments (software agents) with the capability to tailor and adapt instructional material to fit the individuals cognitive strengths and weaknesses, learning style, level of proficiency, and the learners present state of being and understanding across a broad range of content so that learning analogies/approaches can be effectively constructed and implemented by the associate.  At the core of the PLA is an intelligent agent (IA) that emulates an expert personal trainer/coach, capable of learning about an individual, taking into account individual differences (prior knowledge, ability, learning rates, working memory, etc), sensing their learning state (e.g., attention, fatigue), and tracking and monitoring their learning throughout their lifeadapting course material in a manner best suited for the individual.

The purpose of this conference is to provide information on Phase II of the M-GRIN program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.
<p>PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION: The primary objective of the M-GRIN program is to advance macro-scale Gradient Index (GRIN) lens manufacturing capability to Manufacturability Readiness Level 8, and to demonstrate flexible production of lenses in units of 1 to thousands. It is intended that advances in materials development, fabrication, metrology and optical design tools will be coordinated to optimize the manufacturing process for end product performance while managing cost and yield. Performer teams may choose any manufacturing approach from a single manufacturing floor to a distributed model of various design, fabrication and evaluation entities. Prototype challenges may be issued to drive development and evaluate the performance of the materials, design tools, metrology and manufacturing capability. GRIN optical design tools and algorithms developed in Phase I will be made available for use and/or improvement in Phase II. A secondary objective of M-GRIN is to explore new materials, fabrication methods, and applications for GRIN lenses, and studies to addressing these topics will also be considered.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION: Participants must register NLT July 21, 2011 at the following website: https://safe.sysplan.com/sto/mgrin2. Directions to the facility and other materials are also available on the website. There is no registration fee for attending this conference.</p>

<DESC>Lower Snake River Compensation Plan Office, (LSRCP) requests telephone service and internet service in Warm Lake from MTE Communications.  In order to supply the LSRCP with service at our fish hatchery trap, MTE will have to extend its existing telephone infrastructure to the LSRCP facility on the South Fork of the Salmon River.
This will require an extension of approximately 4 miles of new telephone cable plant construction in the right-of-way along Forest Road 488, Warm Lake Road and Forest Road 474.  The extension will require the installation of an electronics cabinet near an existing Idaho Power transformer, on Warm Lake Road.  Construction will primarily consist of plowing, with minimal trenching.  All road crossings will be complete using horizontal directional drilling to avoid road cutting and trenching.  The extension will cross the South Fork of the Salmon River via existing Idaho Power poles and then to the LSRCP facility.  MTE Communications will be responsible for any clean-up work required to return the area to its previous state and any required permits. Telephone service in this area is provided only by MTE Communications.

<p>CONTACT POINTS: Willie W. Lu, Contract Specialist, 301-975-8259<br />Janine Kerns, Contracting Officer 301-975-4267</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with MicroPhotonics for the purchase of an InstaRecon Skycan 1172 Upgrade. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The Skyscan 1172 upgrade that MicroPhotonics offers will upgrade the existing NIST Skyscan 1172 X-ray computed tomography instrument with new image reconstruction control software that uses a new algorithm and by adding an internal loading stage. This loading stage allows mechanical loads to be applied to a sample while being scanned, which will be particularly useful in studying the development of cracks in cement-based materials. The new reconstruction software allows for rapid imaging, which is what is needed for studying the development of cracking. No other internal loading device for a Skyscan X-ray CT unit is manufactured except the one by Skyscan. MicroPhotonics is the sole U.S. distributor for Skyscan.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 423490.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 2:00 p.m. (Eastern) on June 21, 2011. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Willie.Lu@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>The determination whether to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>Project Title:
<p>The assessment of molecular diagnostic assays as alternative reference methods for premarket evaluation of rapid molecular diagnostic devices for influenza</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6 and Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. Currently, funds are not presently available for this contract. FAR PART 52.232-18 SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING - The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>This combined synopsis/solicitation; NAICS code 541380, Testing Laboratories identified as RFQ #1081895, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106; for the following scope of work (SOW), under the simplified acquisition procedures. This is an unrestricted requirement. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation.</p>
<p>A. Objective</p>
<p>The office of In Vitro Diagnostics Device Evaluation and Safety (OIVD) at the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates diagnostic devices for Influenza. Rapid diagnosis of influenza is critical for appropriate patient management in the setting of acute respiratory illness. Rapid molecular diagnostic methods for the detection of influenza are more sensitive and robust than conventional virus isolation methods and are increasingly replacing these conventional methods in the diagnosis of influenza in clinical practice. This poses a regulatory challenge to FDA since currently the determination of sensitivity and specificity of an investigational influenza devices are based on the comparison of the manufacturer's new device to virus culture. This study will determine if it is possible to use alternative molecular diagnostic methods as more rapid and accurate reference methods for the premarket evaluation of influenza devices. It will provide information that could support a paradigm shift on the Agency's review of these devices. Understanding the association between infectious virus and the presence of nucleic acid is essential both for FDA review of newer diagnostic technologies and for properly describing how nucleic acid tests should be used in clinical practice. This project addresses the public health needs as it seeks to expedite and improve the regulatory mission of OIVD through accelerating the availability of safe and effective rapid influenza diagnostic devices. Rapid influenza diagnostic devices are of critical importance, since novel strains of influenza virus have quickly emerged and spread (e.g., recent 2009 H1N1 has).</p>
<p>B. Scope of Work</p>
<p>At this time we are seeking the use of contractors to perform a prospective longitudinal clinical study, collecting respiratory samples e.g., nasal swab samples, from patients clinically diagnosed with influenza during the Influenza season. The basis for confirmation of influenza infection should follow the current standard of care practices including the clinical presentation. Any laboratory tests or testing algorithms used as an aid in the confirmation of active infection should be clearly described as part of the clinical protocol prior to the initiation of the study. It is required that the diagnostic tests used to confirm diagnosis are FDA cleared assays. The contractor shall obtain their own IRB approval for the study and provide us with the clinical specimens de linked and de identified. The date of sample collection, demographic information, clinical symptoms, and days from the onset of symptoms are required.</p>
<p>The nature of the required study is such that samples will be collected initially at the onset of infection and follow up samples will be collected at subsequent time points for up to two weeks after the initial infection. The contractor should have the ability to follow up with the patients for up to 30 days after infection. The target number of patients to be included in the study is 60 patients, immunocompetent individuals (not transplant patients), and we do not have an age restriction. We expect to evaluate the different strains of influenza circulating in the season. However, we plan to stratify the results by age groups and patients infected by the 2009 H1N1 and other seasonal influenza strains. The contract should include a detailed description of the parameters the contractor will use to determine the acute phase of the infection. The contractor should be able to collect the initial nasal samples within three days of symptom onset. Patients have to be followed up obtaining longitudinal samples daily for the first three days post infection and then biweekly for the first two weeks. The proposal should propose a detailed sample collection plan, indicating the time points the contractor is able to include and the appropriate justifications or limitations as applicable. Samples should be shipped fresh to the FDA to perform virus isolation by cell culture and RT-PCR analysis and the proposal should provide a description of the sample shipping plan. We recommend that sample collection and shipment protocols follow standardized guidelines. The contractor should be an entity with recognized academic expertise in the field of Influenza diagnostics and molecular epidemiological studies. It is recommended that the contractor has prior experience in performing viral shedding studies. Prior to the initiation of the clinical study the contractor is required to share knowledge and expertise as well as provide proficiency panels, virus strains or well characterized samples for the validation of FDA's virus culture and RT-PCR methods and the contractor shall be available to communicate and share expertise and discuss the progress and findings of the study. The proposal should indicate the expected deliverables, required budget, payment schedules, and timelines as well as the periodic reporting and communication scheme with the FDA.</p>
<p>C. Tasks:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>1. Perform a longitudinal viral shedding collection study during the influenza season, enrolling patients and collecting nasal samples from patients diagnosed with influenza at the onset of symptoms and subsequently for the first two weeks after infection.</p>
<p>2. Provide proficiency panels or material for the validation of virus isolation and PCR tests used at the FDA.</p>
<p>3. Interact, communicate, and share knowledge and expertise as needed throughout the study period.</p>
<p>Deliverables:</p>
<p>The contractor shall:<br /><br />&bull; Provide the FDA with a detailed study plan <br />&bull; Execute the clinical study; deliver specimens and the required clinical and demographic information to the FDA. <br />&bull; Provide materials and share resources and expertise in developing and validating the diagnostic tests at the FDA. <br />&bull; Share expertise in the data analysis and reporting of results.</p>
<p>Assignments and deliverables are at the discretion of the Principal Investigator of the project at OIVD. The principal investigator will coordinate with the Project Officer, serving as the technical representative responsible for validating the quantity and quality of services received, as well as certifying receipt of required deliverables.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:</p>
<p>The contract performance period shall not exceed two years.</p>
<p>Evaluation:</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>The offerors shall show thorough understanding of the objectives stated in the Scope of Work and offer a logical program for its achievement. All submitted proposals shall not exceed 10 pages. All Proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria.</p>
<p>1. The ability to demonstrate a high level of technical expertise and record of recent successful experience in performing longitudinal Influenza virus shedding in clinical studies in immunocompetent individuals along with having the appropriate infrastructure for storage and shipping samples in place.</p>
<p>2. The ability to demonstrate excellent research expertise and scientific records in the application of and evaluation of FDA cleared in- vitro diagnostic methods for Influenza; including molecular diagnostic tests.</p>
<p>3. Demonstrated experience in record keeping and ability to communicate feasibly via phone, fax, e-mail, and in person. Technical expertise required in maintaining and working with electronic records.</p>
<p>The Government is more concerned with obtaining performance capability superiority rather than lowest overall cost. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to the Government to achieve only slightly superior performance. Overall cost to the Government may become the ultimate determining factor for award of a contract as quotations become more equal based on the other factors.</p>
<p>CCR: Vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) prior to the award of a contract. You may register by going to www.ccr.gov . You will need your Duns &amp; Bradstreet number and banking information.</p>

<p>(End Addendum)</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) Award Basis: The Government's evaluation of quotation will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under the Addenda to FAR 52.212-1 of 1.) Price and 2.) Technical Qualification. The evaluation of these factors will utilize the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) award basis. Quotes that do not meet the quote specifics, will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without exchanges or communications and therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms.</p>
<p>(b) Evaluation: Evaluation factors for price and technical qualification as required under the addendum to 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows;</p>
<p>i. Price: To evaluate price reasonableness, a comparison will be made amongst all received quotations and the Government's estimate.</p>
<p>ii. Technical Qualification: A vendor's quotation will be considered technically acceptable if it meets the requirements detailed in paragraph C5 above. Quotations that do not meet these requirements will be considered unacceptable and therefore, under the LPTA evaluation process, will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>(c) Award Determination: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors whose quotes are determined to be technically qualified, and therefore technically acceptable, will be considered for award. No trade-offs will be permitted between price, and the non-price factor of technical capability. Of those vendors found technically acceptable, an award determination will be made to the lowest priced vendor that is determined to be reasonable, realistic, and affordable.</p>
<p>(End Provision)</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. <br />If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one of the following:<br />Primary point of contact:<br />Contract Specialist: Wendell D. Gibson<br />TEL: 01638-52-2235 or EM: wendell.gibson@lakenheath.af.mil</p>

<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.

Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or by e-mail. When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by an e-mail or facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.</p>
<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p><br />REQUIRED INSURANCE</p>

<p>INSPECTIONS</p>
<p>Except as specified elsewhere, the U.S. Coast Guard shall rely on the Contractor to accomplish all inspection and testing needed to ensure that the work conforms to contract quality requirements.</p>
<p>Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the term of this contract and for such longer period as may be specified elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>The name and telephone number of the U.S. Coast Guard Inspector will be provided after the award of a contract resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY</p>
<p>No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>
<p>CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), MLCA Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COTR. The COTR will comment on the Contractor's response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the Contractor, the PBPL Availability Project Manager, and the NESU. The Contracting Officer will render a final determination and provide it to the Contractor and COTR in writing.</p>

Price: The total price will be the evaluated price.<br /><br />(a) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />EVALUATION APPROACH</p>
<p>1. An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>2. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals as deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the purpose of this solicitation technical capability and past performance are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit proposals that will be considered by the agency. Proposals must fully address all Technical Capabilities Factors and Past Performance. No reference to Price shall be included in the Proposal. Proposals must contain the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number. Proposals must be received no later than <br />27 JUN 11:00 A.M. Local California time. Proposals received after the date and time specified will not be considered. Proposals may be submitted as an attachment to an e-mail addressed to: Brenda.l.lentz@uscg.mil .</p>

<p><br />OMBUDSMAN NOTICE</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p>Introduction: This announcement constitutes the annual posting of BAA, HQ0147-10-MSTAR-BAA. The next submission date for submittal of white papers submitted under topics areas 1 through 8 as outlined in this BAA is established as 01 September 2011.</p>
<p>Posted Information:<br />The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) develops and fields the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States (US), as well as US allies and friends from ballistic missile attack. The MDA Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, interceptors, directed energy systems, battle management, and command and control elements that will engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from boost and early intercept phases through midcourse into terminal phase. MDA efforts focus on making the BMDS more robust against increasing threats, and improving BMDS capabilities to handle a broad range of unknown missiles, warheads, trajectories, and adversaries. MDA must have the ability to detect, track, identify and kill the ballistic missile.</p>
<p>MDA instituted the Missile Defense Agency Science and Technology Advanced Research (MSTAR) program to fund relevant advanced research at qualified, accredited domestic colleges, universities or institutions of higher learning and to support training of future scientists and engineers in the field of missile defense. This BAA is a recurring, competitive solicitation and contract vehicle to identify and acquire emerging technologies, innovative concepts, and advanced algorithms to improve the BMDS capability and fill technology gaps.</p>
<p>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d) (2), which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984." Any contracts awarded from this BAA must comply with the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR).</p>
<p>Only domestic accredited colleges, universities or institutions of higher learning registered by the U.S. Department of Education may submit proposals under this BAA. Organizations selected for a contract must be a qualified education institution at time of award. If the proposal is based on a subcontract or teaming arrangement, the college, university or educational institution submitting the proposal is required to perform 50 percent or more of the effort. For planning purposes, we award only Firm-Fixed Price or Cost level of effort contracts. Although subject to official fiscal appropriation and availability, we anticipate each MSTAR contract's funding at between $600,000 and $800,000 for a period of two or three years. Funding ceilings are $300,000 a year during the two year base period of performance with a potential option for a third year of performance funded at a maximum of $200,000. Inclusion of options in any contract is at the discretion of the Government. The Government is also not obligated to exercise any option period included in an awarded contract.</p>
<p>MDA requires that lead Principal Investigators of institutions submitting a proposal under this program hold US citizenship. MDA desires that participating students conducting research for or sponsored under this program award, hold US citizenship. In addition, the Government reserves<br />the right to request special justification for considering any student who is a non-US citizen, but who holds a valid green card, for participation in research for or sponsored through this program award. Students without valid green cards are ineligible for consideration and participation altogether.</p>
<p>If MDA decides to pursue a concept, the appropriate level of funding will be identified, and a MDA contracting officer will send a written request for a final proposal. Funding of research within MDA areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during the budget cycle. Therefore, those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to contact the MDA technical point of contact, Richard Schwarz, MDA/DVI; 256-955-1835; email Richard.schwarz@mda.mil to determine the likelihood of funding prior to committing resources to preparing a proposal in response to this BAA. In order to facilitate meaningful information exchanges that could contain unclassified technical data disclosing military critical technology with military or space application that is under the control or in the possession of the U,S. Department of Defense (DoD). Please submit via email an approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement to the technical point of contact. (Reference http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for information regarding this program and form.) Coordination with the technical point of contact prior to proposal submission allows earliest determination of interest and the potential for funding; avoiding contractor and Government time spent on efforts that may have little chance of being supported. Any awards are anticipated to occur in late fiscal year (FY) 2011 into FY 2012.</p>
<p>Research Topics</p>
<p>MDA/DV is interested in technology research for each missile defense phase encompassing the entire engagement sequence to include surveillance, acquisition and tracking, discrimination, communications, engagement planning, threat engagement, and kill assessment. The following technology research topic areas pertain to the BMDS in all phases of the missile defense threat scenario:</p>
<p>(1) Radar Systems</p>
<p>(2) Lasers and Electro-Optical Systems</p>
<p>(3) Integrated InfraRed Sensor Systems</p>
<p>(4) Computer Science, Signal and Data Processing</p>
<p>(5) Mathematics, Probability, and Decision Theory</p>
<p>(6) Physics, Chemistry, and Materials</p>
<p>(7) Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</p>
<p>(8) Battle Management/Command and Control</p>
<p>(9) Educational Engineering and Science Student Outreach (EESSO): Proposals for this area must address development, implementation and execution of programs and activities in support of the MDA's EESSO program. EESSO's purpose is to expose K-12 students to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields (curricula, programs and activities) in order to increase the number of United States (U.S.) citizens choosing science, math and/or engineering as a career path. This is the only area that we will entertain accepting proposals for other than Advanced Technology Research under this MSTAR BAA.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following:</p>
<p>(1) A summary concept proposal (no more than ten pages) which succinctly illustrates the proposed technical approach, as well as its rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and potential contribution to the MDA program using the attached Proposal Instructions paragraph (4) (a), (b), (c). <br />(2) Proposal Rough Order of Cost Magnitude (ROCM), using the attached Cost Proposal Instructions paragraph (5). <br />(3) A suggested program plan, statement of work and schedule using the attached Proposal Instructions paragraph (4) (f), (e).<br />(4) A description of the offeror's capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities using the attached Proposal Instructions paragraph (4) (g), (d), (h).<br />(5) A signed copy of the attached Representations and Certifications. Proposal Instruction paragraph (8).</p>
<p>Evaluations may take up to six months from receipt of proposals to complete. If selected for award MDA will request a detailed cost proposal as requested in the attached proposal instructions. DO NOT SUBMIT THE FULL COST PROPOSAL UNTIL YOU RECEIVE A REQUEST FROM THE CONTRACTING OFFICER FOR THIS INFORMATION.</p>
<p>The Government may use selected Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), support contractors, and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement. These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information. Additionally non-government employees must disclose all applicable corporate organizational conflicts of interest as well as any personal financial conflict. Submission of proposals under this BAA constitutes the offerors acknowledgment and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process.</p>
<p>The evaluation team will evaluate and make recommendations for award, based on a peer or scientific review process in accordance with FAR 35.016(d) and (e). The primary basis for selecting proposals will utilize the below listed evaluation factors by applying the delineated criteria as follows:</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS AND CRITERIA</p>
<p>MDA will evaluate responses based upon the following five technical factors (weighted equally) and a cost evaluation:</p>
<p>(1) Scientific and technical excellence of the research and its relevance to MDA goals with special emphasis on innovation, originality, and uniqueness; <br />(2) The offeror's capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; techniques, or unique combinations of these are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; <br />(3) Qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and/or key personnel that are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; <br />(4) Ability of the proposed effort to make progress toward demonstrating the feasibility of the concept in accordance with MDA programmatic needs; <br />(5) Adequacy of management planning and controls; demonstrated ability to deliver results from research projects, on schedule, on or under cost; and</p>
<p>Cost will be evaluated against the government's estimate of the cost of completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed; total evaluated probable cost consists of the government's estimate of the realistic cost of completing the offerors proposals, to include the government's assessment of program risk, and additional costs to the government such as government-furnished property, government-furnished information, transportation, the duplication of previously awarded contracts submitted by the offeror, similar technology efforts pursued elsewhere and other cost related factors.</p>
<p>The following criteria will be applied to each factor for evaluation of each offeror's proposal:</p>
<p>(1) The scientific excellence and innovative quality of the proposed technology or application; <br />(2) The offerors' capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and <br />(3) The relevance of the technology or application to the MDA program, to include maturity and level of risk; <br />(4) Demonstrated ability or clear plan to deliver results from research projects on schedule and under cost.</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used. The government intends to evaluate and recommend awards based upon its evaluation of proposals without discussions; however, the government reserves the right to hold discussions and solicit final technical proposal revisions if deemed necessary. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.</p>
<p>Offerors are reminded that this BAA is for the acquisition of advanced technology for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution. Proposals related to the development of a specific system will be returned as non-responsive. This BAA covers the fiscal year 2010 and 2011 timeframe. The next response date for proposals submitted is not later than 1 September 2011. <br />Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs (to include those proposals selected for award).</p>

<CONTACT>Vanessa Seymour, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-696-4591, Email vanessa.seymour@navy.mil - Brian A Almquist, Program Officer, Phone (703) 696-3351, Email brian.almquist@navy.mil
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is seeking white papers describing innovative technology solutions leading to wide-area detection, classification, localization and tracking of surface and near-surface drifting / oscillating mines and prediction of mine drift from direct environmental observations and ocean models to support tactical planning. Surface and near-surface drifting mines include: mines designed to drift on the ocean surface; mines designed to drift and oscillate near the ocean surface within a preset depth range; improvised explosive devices intentionally cast adrift to harass maritime traffic; and moored mines intentionally or unintentionally separated from a tether.
<p>There are two distinct but strongly connected products that work together to enable effective planning and conduct of mine countermeasures (MCM) operations in drifting mine environments. They are: (1) Compact Modular Sensor / Processing Suite (CMSS), and; (2) Mine Drift Tactical Decision Aid (TDA). It is likely that mature hardware solutions already exist and that the required innovation will come from the optimization of a sensor suite, the development of real-time target recognition algorithms, and techniques to characterize the environment in real-time onboard the platform.</p>
<p>1. Compact Modular Sensor and Processing Suite (CMSS)</p>
<p>The Compact Modular Sensor and Processing Suite (CMSS) is a wide-area search, multi-mission, platform-independent sensor package to provide real-time, day/night&nbsp;detection, classification, and localization of surface and near-surface drifting / oscillating mines through the fusion of compact sensors, advanced algorithms, and real-time onboard processing technologies. The deliverable will be a sensor package with improved algorithms integrated with data processing for real-time detection, classification, localization, and tracking from a tactical unmanned airborne vehicle (TUAV). The classification must be onboard the TUAV in real-time to allow for immediate neutralization of the target by a separate system (not addressed in this BAA). The sensor suite must also provide in-situ information about the environment to be used with the Mine Drift TDA to predict drift trajectories. Possible sensors include, but are not limited to, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Real Aperture Radar (RAR), and Electro-Optic Sensors.</p>
<p>2. Mine Drift Prediction Tactical Decision Aid (TDA)</p>
<p>The Mine Drift Tactical Decision Aid (TDA) will enable MCM planning operations in areas threatened by near-surface drifting mines. It will: (1) predict drift trajectories using real-time environmental and target observations from CMSS, oceanographic model data, and other sources to provide intelligent preparation of the environment before operations commence and situational awareness during operations; (2) provide tools to allow optimal deployment of the CMSS for search and/or environmental information gathering; and (3) provide tools to generate a ship maneuver plan which minimizes risk of engaging drifting threats. The final product will be a set of modular software components integrated into the existing mine warfare command and control environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tasks:</p>
<p>Offerors can choose to propose solutions that address the entire problem or select aspects of the problem that best match their experience and capabilities. To facilitate this, ONR has broken down the problem into separate tasks. Offerors choosing to propose a solution to the entire problem must provide a separate white paper for each task.<br />(1) Wide-Area Detection, Classification, Localization, and Tracking of Surface Drifting Mines</p>
<p>In this task, a test-bed with one or more sensors will be optimally configured and flight tested to demonstrate wide-area detection, classification, localization and tracking of surface drifting mines as well as the collection of data to be used to characterize the ocean environment. The emphasis is on targets that are on or close to the ocean surface but not submerged under the ocean surface enough to require the use of sensors designed to penetrate a substantial amount of water. A reasonable water depth for targets on or close to the ocean surface would be 0 to 3 feet.</p>
<p>The data collected will be used for the development and evaluation of target recognition algorithms and characterization of the ocean environment. The data will be delivered in a Government specified format for distribution to performers working on the development of target recognition algorithms (Task 3) or characterization of the ocean environment (Task 4). The contractor(s) will participate in the flight test and data collection. The Government anticipates data collection to occur within 12 to 15 months after contract award.</p>
<p>(2) Detection, Classification, Localization, and Tracking of Near-Surface Drifting and/or Oscillating Mines</p>
<p>In this task, a test-bed with one or more sensors will be optimally configured and flight tested to demonstrate detection, classification, localization and tracking of near-surface drifting and oscillating mines as well as the collection of data to be used to characterize the ocean environment. The emphasis is on targets that are submerged below the ocean surface enough to require the use of sensors that can penetrate a substantial amount of water. The maximum water depth would be 40 feet.</p>
<p>The data collected will be used for the development and evaluation of target recognition algorithms and characterization of the environment. The data will be delivered in a Government specified format for distribution to selected contractors working on target recognition algorithms (Task 3) or characterization of the environment (Task 4). The contractors will participate in the flight test and data collection. The Government anticipates data collection to occur within 15 to 24 months after contract award.</p>
<p>(3) Target Recognition Algorithm Development</p>
<p>This task will develop two sets of detection &amp; classification algorithms; one set for surface mines (i.e., with a surface expression) and one for submerged mines (up to the working depths of the sensors). White papers may address only one or both of these algorithm sets. A single algorithm set addressing both surface and submerged mines is also acceptable. The data sets emerging from Task 1 and Task 2 will not be available immediately; therefore contractors are encouraged to use existing data sets containing relevant targets to begin the demonstration of proposed algorithms before newly collected data sets are made available. Offerors must have access to existing data sets or demonstrate the ability to acquire existing data sets. The sensor details will depend on Task 1 &amp; Task 2, but sensing modalities may include synthetic aperture radar, passive electro-optic, and active electro-optic. Additional consideration should be given to exploiting information including but not limited to thermal, polarimetry, and multispectral. Algorithms should accept raw data and produce data products according to a Government specified format. They should be modular such that they can be demonstrated in both post-mission software architecture and deployed in an embedded, real-time, power constrained TUAV. The primary challenge in algorithm design for this application stems from the extreme variability in environmental conditions. Therefore, in order to be considered competitive, the white papers must provide enough information to demonstrate that the proposed algorithms have sufficient ability to adapt to these variations. Further, offerors are encouraged to consider the use of performance estimation models to both estimate/report expected and in situ performance as well as optimally adapt the detection and classification process to the particular environment encountered. The deliverable includes a description of the algorithims and detailed explanation of the results. The Government anticipates data sets to be available within 2 - 3 months after completion of each data collection flight test as described in Task 1, Task 2, and Task 4.</p>
<p>(4) Characterization of the Ocean Environment</p>
<p>In this task, a test-bed with one or more sensors will be optimally configured and flight tested to enable observation of environmental phenomena relevant to the Detection, Classification, Localization, and Tracking of surface drifting mines and near-surface drifting and oscillating mines. The observations should be suitable for determining directional surface gravity wave spectra, surface currents, and indicators of optical properties of the water column, at a minimum. It is expected that sensing approaches to Tasks 1 and Task 2 and data collected during those tasks may also be suitable for environmental characterization; however, additional sensors may be necessary or desired to collect the information needed to characterize the environment.</p>
<p>(5) Mine Drift Prediction Tactical Decision Aid (TDA)</p>
<p>This task will integrate environmental data generated in Task 1, Task 2, and Task 4 as well as other sources (which may include in situ drifting sensors, output from NAVO models, intelligence products, among others) to produce an optimal forecast of mine drift, dispersion and probability of detection. A hierarchy of oceanographic models should be considered to address data availability, since data available for assimilation into forecasting models may be abundant, sparse or non-existent. Mine drift forecasts will be integrated into a set of planning tools to enable preparation of the battlespace before operations and situational awareness during operations. At a minimum, TDA planning tools should provide the capability to plan efficacious deployment of CMSS, and the capability to plan ship maneuvers. The deliverable is a stand-alone software service compatible with MIW C2 (e.g., MEDAL-EA, EPMA and NSAM).</p>
<p>The Government anticipates integrating a final test bed configuration for the purpose of simultaneously collecting data with the sensors demonstrated in Task 1, Task 2, and Task 4.</p>
<p>Offerors should submit separate white papers for each task of interest. Offerors addressing two or more tasks may also submit a separate overview document describing synergies between tasks.</p>
<p>White papers should propose solutions which are suitable for deployment from a tactical unmanned airborne vehicle (TUAV) flying at a minimum altitude of 3000 feet and at a minimum velocity of 75 knots. The target platform is the Firescout MQ-8B. It is reasonable to assume that there will be a 28 VDC power source capable of supplying a 2.5 KW of power. Target detection and classification shall be conducted in real-time onboard the TUAV to enable immediate neutralization of the target by a separate system. Proposed solutions must be able to demonstrate: (1) a high probability of detection, low number of false contacts, and classification onboard the platform to a level sufficient to classify the target with a high level of confidence; and (2) characterization of the environment in real-time onboard the platform. The technology solutions must be demonstrated at a technology readiness level (TRL) of 6.</p>
<p><br />After down-selecting white papers, full proposals may be requested from selected candidates. The maturity level of any hardware proposals addressing this BAA should be sufficient to support early Government supported testing. Testing will be over realistic target fields and will provide data sets to Task 3, and Task 5 performers. The ONR will require that all data sets collected be provided to the Government in a format suitable for distribution to additional performers to develop data handling and processing techniques, real-time algorithms and onboard classification techniques, and data fusion techniques.</p>

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Central Issue Warehouses, Support Supply Activity Warehouses, and General Purpose Warehouses located in the state of Georgia.  The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Cody Cotten, 817-886-1077; or by e-mail at cody.d.cotten@usace.army.mil .  FOR INFORMATION ONLY: FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Business Process. USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but are also the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned. Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization. Of those forty one, Fort Worth District (SWF) has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Warrior in Transition (WT) facilities, Reception Station Barracks, Drill Sergeant Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses, Support Supply Activity Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The IDIQ contracts for Barracks are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) and Northeast ( CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion. The IDIQ contracts for Warehouses are located in East and West of the Mississippi River and have been distributed accordingly.<BR>SCOPE OF WORK: <BR><BR>Central Issue Warehouses:  The primary mission of the CIFs is to provide a single point for receipt, storage, issue, exchange, and return of all authorized organizational clothing and individual equipment items at the specified United States Army Installation.  CIF facilities provide storage capabilities combined with office space, used in the administration of issuing soldiers equipment as needed.  The facilities support open storage for deployment functions as necessary by the Army Unit occupying the building.  The functional and operational requirements of the CIW require that the design be based on the characteristics of the material being handled and stored, the volume and flow pattern through the facility, and the inventory pattern.  Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary as required to meet project specific requirements.<BR>Support Supply Activity Warehouses: SSAs will provide a facility capable of storing and maintaining the Army prepositioned stocks (APS) and items required for active duty operation.  The facility is similar to a parts wholesale warehouse.  The functional and operational requirements of the SSA require that the design be based on the Adapt-Build Model standard design.    Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will not vary.<BR>General Purpose Warehouses: GPWs will be capable of supporting the storage of various equipment and materials, up to a Moderate-hazard level.  GPW facilities may have substantially differing design and operational requirements in order to meet the Armys needs on a worldwide basis.  The facility type will provide an acceptable relationship between actual equipment dimensions, performance characteristics and the building dimensions.  GPWs are intended to be similar both functionally and technically to private sector industrial warehouses  Supporting facilities include utilities; electric service; water, sewer, gas; paving, walks, curbs and gutters; storm drainage; site improvements and information systems.  Access for persons with disabilities will be provided in public areas.  Comprehensive building and furnishings related interior design services are required.  Comprehensive warehouse pallet and racking systems related to warehouse functional design services are required.  Air conditioning will be provided in administrative areas, and warehouse areas will be ventilated and heated.  Supporting work includes fire protection sprinkler and fire detection systems of the warehouses.  <BR>It is the intent of Government to issue design-build and adapt-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region.<BR>CONTRACT INFORMATION:   <BR>This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation.  The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will select no more than 5 to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process.  <BR>In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.  <BR>The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Phase I  Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach;  Phase II  Volume I: Building Functional, Aesthetics and Space; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; Site Design; and Sustainability Requirements.  Volume II:  Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Utilization of Small Business Concerns.  All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price.  <BR>Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 18 Oct 2010 under solicitation number W9126G-11-R-0054.  This procurement is HUBZone set-aside.  Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 18 Nov 2010 (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction).  The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million.<BR><BR>MATOC: <BR>The Government intends to award at least two and up to five contracts as a result of this solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to award only the initial task as a C-type, stand alone contract if it is determined that firms responding do not have the past performance, required bonding, or demonstrated experience for a contract of this magnitude.  The remaining capacity would then be re-advertised as a full and open competition.  Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.  It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance. The Government reserves the right to award additional contracts for the MATOC pool from a separate solicitation.   Other solicitations for similar work in this same region may be advertised to meet the Governments needs for this facility type.  THIS SOLICITATION IS SET-ASIDE FOR HUBZone.<BR><BR>The total estimated contract capacity is $100,000,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.  The minimum guarantee will be $ 2,500.  The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders.   The minimum task order limitation is $1,000,000.  The maximum task order limitation for the contracts is $10,000,000.  The maximum combination of orders is $15,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  Task orders issued as a result of this contract will be firm-fixed price.  <BR>The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening.  Proposals from Large businesses must comply with FAR Clause 52.219-9, regarding the requirement for a Subcontracting Plan.  The Fort Worth District goals (expressed as a percentage of the contractors total planned subcontract amount) are as follows:  Small Business 70.0%; Small Disadvantaged Business 6.2%; Women-Owned Small Business 7.0%; HUBZone Small Business 9.8%, Veteran-Owned Small Business 3.5%; and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business 2%.  Plans and specifications will not be provided in a hard paper copy.    Contractors may view and/or download this solicitation and all amendments from FedBizOps.<BR> Because of the size of our solicitations, you should not attempt to view them online.  Rather download them to your local hard drive and then open them.  Use of the FedBizOps website requires prior registration at https://www.fbo.gov. It is the offerors responsibility to monitor the FedBizOps web site (using the above link) for amendments to the solicitation.  Offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (http://www.ccr.gov/), in order to receive a Government contract award.<BR>

Supporting work includes fire protection sprinkler and fire detection systems of the warehouses. <br />It is the intent of Government to issue design-build and adapt-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region.<br />CONTRACT INFORMATION: <br />This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process. In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will select no more than 5 to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process. <br />In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal. The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost. To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award. In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee. <br />The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Phase I Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach; Phase II Volume I: Building Functional, Aesthetics and Space; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; Site Design; and Sustainability Requirements. Volume II: Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Utilization of Small Business Concerns. All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price. <br />Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 18 Oct 2010 under solicitation number W9126G-11-R-0054. This procurement is HUBZone set-aside. Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 18 Nov 2010 (30 days from issuance of the solicitation). The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction). The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million.<br /><br />MATOC: <br />The Government intends to award at least two and up to five contracts as a result of this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award only the initial task as a C-type, stand alone contract if it is determined that firms responding do not have the past performance, required bonding, or demonstrated experience for a contract of this magnitude. The remaining capacity would then be re-advertised as a full and open competition. Each contract will remain active: 1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government. It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance. The Government reserves the right to award additional contracts for the MATOC pool from a separate solicitation. Other solicitations for similar work in this same region may be advertised to meet the Governments needs for this facility type. THIS SOLICITATION IS SET-ASIDE FOR HUBZone.<br /><br />The total estimated contract capacity is $100,000,000. The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months. The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government. The minimum guarantee will be $ 2,500. The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only. Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders. The minimum task order limitation is $1,000,000. The maximum task order limitation for the contracts is $10,000,000. The maximum combination of orders is $15,000,000. The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. Task orders issued as a result of this contract will be firm-fixed price. <br />The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition. There will be no public bid opening. Because of the size of our solicitations, you should not attempt to view them online. Rather download them to your local hard drive and then open them. Use of the FedBizOps website requires prior registration at https://www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), located on the National Naval Medical Center (NNMC) in Bethesda, MD, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The rSmart Group, Inc., for a three (3) year (base period of 12 months + 2 option periods of 12 months each) purchase order to provide ongoing support for its current rSmart CLE version of Sakai. In 2010, rSmart implemented its modified version of the Sakai Open Source Learning Management System as USUHS. The rSmart version of Sakai, which is available through the rSmart website, modifies and integrates the Sakai Community releases. USUHS is currently operating rSmart CLE version 2.7 and intends to upgrade to 2.8 when released this summer by rSmart. USUHS seeks subscription support for 8,000 user licenses to include Tier 1-3 support, knowledge-base access and the Icodeon SCORM-compliant player.<br /><br />This service will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12 - Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
<p>Sole source determination is made in accordance with:</p>
<p>FAR Part 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition</p>
<p>(b) Soliciting from a single source</p>
<p>(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.</p>
<p>The mission of USUHS is to provide the highest quality education programs in the health sciences to those selected individuals who demonstrate dedication to a health profession career in the Uniformed Services. As such, it is essential USUHS provide the necessary services required for our students to become successful doctors and nurses and to be able to provide the best care possible for our soldiers.</p>
<p>USUHS completed its migration from Blackboard to Sakai in May 2011. USUHS created 389 new course sites and 94 new project sites to support courses provided by the School of Medicine, Graduate School of Nursing and Graduate School. The rSmart CLE version of Sakai is central to the implementation of the School of Medicine Curriculum Reform, which impacts the Class of 2015, for whom classes begin in August 2011. USUHS Sakai implementation is integrated with LDAP, JASIG CAS, Kuali Rice, and the USUHS Registrar System. USUHS summer courses began at the end of May and pre-fall courses for the Graduate students commence in July. USUHS implementation of Sakai operates on two (2) Red Hat servers, is managed through an Application Data Controller. USUHS requires a system that is integrated with Kuali, Registrar systems, LDAP and CAS.</p>
<p>The rSmart Group, Inc., is the only known source that can meet the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can meet the above-mentioned requirement as specified.

We have heard the final RFP will be released in Feb 2010 (4 weeks following the receipt of industry questions regarding the draft PWS).  The Draft PWS does not provide adequate information to evaluate and prepare for proposal activities.  Evaluation criteria and instructions in draft form will enable us to properly plan for resources needed to support the proposal responses as well as the bid decision. Response:  The RFP release date has not been determined.  Evaluation criteria as well as other information will be provided at a later date along with a schedule.  You should be checking FedBizOps for the latest information. Here are some of the questions we need to answer to help our senior management make a bid decision:  a.	Will award be based on all functional areas (like Alliant) or a subset of the functional areas (like Eagle)?  Response:  The acquisition strategy has not been determined.b.	Is it the VA's desire that this be a small business set-aside contract, that large businesses sub to small businesses. Was the Sources Sought released to gauge small business interest and level of participation? Response:  The acquisition strategy has not been determined.  We are currently in the process of conducting market research which will assist us in determining the acquisition strategy.c.	To limit the number of awards, does the VA want industry to cluster together to form large teams (eg:: Northrop Grumman as prime with Lockheed Martin and GD and lots of small businesses as subs)?  Response:  The number of awards has not yet been determined.  2.	We have heard that responses to sample tasks will be required 15 days before proposal responses.  The purpose of this exercise to assess how well offerors respond to quick-turn TOs.  However, at proposal preparation time, offerors will not have their T4 TO response organizations established, therefore that exercise will not adequately measure our ability to quickly respond (once our T4 Task Order Response organization is established)..  a.

<SUBJECT>Accurate and timely fire weather data to estimate fire danger risk, and to predict wildfire behavior in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey.  
<SOLNBR>AG-63PX-S-11-0067

<DONBR>None
<DESC>The USFS requires the collection and ingest of four to six fire weather towers that we operate in the New Jersey Pine Barrens, and the ingest of a series of towers operated by the NJ Weather and Climate Network (NJWxNet) and the NJ Forest Fire Service RAWS towers. We also require the maintenance of the NJFireNet web sites listed above, and the delivery of fire weather data to other users (the MADIS and MesoWest/ROMAN networks). In addition, maintenance of fire weather sensors on selected towers surrounding the Pine Barrens is required.
<p>In addition to these activities, we are requesting the delivery of fire weather data from a series of Mesonet and other towers in and around the Pine Barrens for modeling fire danger and fire behavior during selected events, such as the 2007 wildfire at Warren Grove, and a series of wildfires that occurred in the spring and summer of 2010. We are requesting as long a dataset as is available, to be provided in a specific format for ingest into the FireFamily Plus and other modeling packages.</p>
