These consortia should combine inclusive organizational governance and trust relationships, provider organizations and healthcare markets, consumer applications and participating consumers, existing health exchange activities and technical expertise.   
Each Contractor shall work cooperatively with the other contractors to develop specifications for, and trial implementations of, the NHIN, and test these trial implementations with each other to ensure that they can all work together to implement an interoperable "network of networks" - built on top of the Internet. The trial implementations shall demonstrate core services, exchange summary patient records and support the capabilities outlined in several AHIC use cases based on shared NHIN standards and specifications. The trial implementations shall demonstrate the represented information exchanges with provider organizations, personal health records, specialty networks, and the other NHIN contractors.
This is a partial small business set-aside with up to a third of the contracts awarded to small businesses. We anticipate the award of up to 10 contracts. The period of performance shall be for a period of 1 year, with two 1-year options.  Options will be evaluated with the base period.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Region has a requirement for Architect/Engineering Services for design of a dam removal and channel construction project on the Mt Adams Ranger District near Carson, Washington. Required services will include conceptual design document preparation, preparation of final construction documents, including all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines, and a firm estimate of construction cost. In addition, applicants must provide consulting services through the construction period.  The completed channel and surroundings shall be designed to restore historic fish passage, to incorporate native materials in the design, to permit natural stream processes such as floods, sediment movement and deposition, and to retain the capability for channel adjustment in response to disturbance.   
Design services are required for the decommission and disposal of the dam and associated facilities, removal of sediments from behind the dam, and for construction of a channel through the stream reach currently occupied by the reservoir or influenced by the dam.  Disposal of construction materials from the dam and associated facilities, and disposal and stabilization of sediments will be part of the design, as will water management during construction activities.  In addition, designs will include site prep and post-dam removal rehabilitation to restore native riparian vegetation to the disturbed areas.  Constructed channel and all site rehabilitation and water management shall meet Federal, State and Local regulations and standards.
The applicable NAICS code for this project is 541330 with a corresponding size standard of $4.5 million.  This procurement is 100% set aside for HUBZone small business concerns.  Both HUBZone and non-HUBZone firms are encouraged to submit their Standard Form (SF) 330 in response to this announcement.  In the event that there are an inadequate number of SF 330s received from interested HUBZone firms that are evaluated and ranked as highly qualified, SF 330s from non-HUBZone firms will be considered.  Firms will be evaluated and ranked in accordance with the terms of the Brooks Act.
The estimated contract start date is July 16, 2007 with the performance period running through December 31, 2008 or until project construction is complete.
Evaluation Criteria
The following factors will be used for the purpose of evaluation and determination of the most highly qualified firms, among which the awardees will be selected.  Submitted SF 330?s should address these areas specifically:
1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services (25%).  Of importance to the Government in establishing a firm as highly qualified in this area will be:
a) A designer of record professionally registered in their discipline and licensed in the state of Washington.

b) The presence of highly qualified personnel in key applicable positions such as Engineers, Hydrologists, Aquatic Biologists, and Fluvial Geomorphologists.

2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required (25%).  Of importance to the Government in establishing a firm as highly qualified in this area will be:
a) Recent successful experience in designs of natural channels with bankfull discharges of 1500 cubic feet per second or greater.

b) Experience managing surface and subsurface water in construction areas and on similar-sized streams to maintain water quality at levels that meet state standards and permit requirements.

c) Experience incorporating deformable banks and prioritizing use of native materials into project designs.

d) Experience designing and implementing dam removals of similar scale.

e) Experience working in streams in steep mountainous terrain characteristic of the Pacific Northwest.

3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time (10%).  Of particular importance to the Government in establishing a firm as highly qualified in this area will be:
a) The ability to provide design services in a timely fashion starting immediately upon issuance of the notice to proceed. 

b) The availability of assistance during the construction phase, and the ability to provide that assistance in a timely fashion.

4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules (15%).  In establishing a firm as highly qualified in this area the Government will be looking for the following:

a) The ability to design and provide technical services during construction for complex aquatics projects that require sequencing of multiple construction activities.

b) An established and successful working relationship between all team members that work under this contract, and clear lines of authority on the proposed team.

c) Experience in working outside the firm?s typical area of operation, and have established methods to ensure quality control under these circumstances.

SF 330s will be evaluated to determine the most highly qualified firm based on criteria responses.  Evaluating past performance and experience may include review of information provided by the firm, customer inquires, Government databases, and publicly available sources.  Failure to provide requested data, inaccessible points of contact, or invalid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified.

<DESC>Last year, the first Large Tactical Sensor Networks (LTSN) BAA 06-015 was issued with seven product areas. To continue the development of new technologies under this program, this second BAA having five product areas will highlight specific technologies for development. The goal of the Large Tactical Sensor Networks program is to develop and demonstrate measurable advances to enable sensor networks of unmanned vehicles and unattended ground sensors to rapidly respond to small unit intelligence requirements, automatically sense the tactical environment and perform automated translation, fusion, and dissemination of sensor data into actionable intelligence.  This will be accomplished through technology development and algorithms that can directly support expeditionary warfighting forces in the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).  Large Tactical Sensor Networks are envisioned to operate in a net centric environment  providing support to expeditionary forces to carry out the warfighting philosophies of the Marine Corps , Special Operations, and the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC).  ONR seeks both to automate processes that provide small tactical units with an automated understanding of relationships among battlespace objects and events and to automate management of multiple hypotheses about the intent of these objects and groupings.  Data analysis and fusion algorithms resulting from this research will be integrated into emerging net-centric Navy and Marine Corps Command & Control and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2 and ISR) acquisition programs and Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) through a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).   Sensor network management and human interface technologies will also be designed to be integrated with relevant naval unmanned vehicle systems such as the Marine Corps Tier II UAV.

A critical area of focus for DHS is the development and deployment of technologies to protect the nation's cyber infrastructure, including the Internet and other critical infrastructures that depend on computer systems for their mission.

The goals of the DHS Cyber Security Research and Development Center (CSRDC) program are (1)  to perform research and development (R&D) aimed at improving the security of existing deployed technologies, and to ensure the security of new emerging systems; (2)  to develop new and enhanced technologies for the detection of, prevention of, and response to cyber attacks on the nation's critical information infrastructure; and (3)  to assist the transfer of these technologies into the national infrastructure as a matter of urgency.  

To achieve these goals, this BAA calls for research and development in nine Technical Topic Areas (TTAs).  Proposals shall be submitted to one of the nine TTAs, and shall be structured to be one of three Type classifications, depending on the maturity of the technology.  

The due dates and times established for the receipt of White Papers and Full Proposals are as indicated in Section IV, Paragraph 3 of this BAA.

<DESC>This is a presolicitation notice for the Department of Treasury, OCC Short-Term and Long-Term Diability Insurance.  The OCC is seeking an experienced and qualified Contractor to underwrite and administer its Short-Term Disability (STD) and Long-Term Disability (LTD) Insurance Programs.  The Contractor shall administer these programs from an integrated disability management approach to ease the transition from STD to LTD.  Also, this integrated approach will aid in return to work efforts, rehabilitative employment, and early social security notice.  Currently, these programs are underwritten and administered separately by two different insurance companies.  OCCs objective is to award only one contract to a single Contractor.

Under the OCC STD program, the weekly benefit is 60 percent of weekly earnings up to a weekly maximum benefit amount of $2,307.  There is an elimination period of seven (7) calendar days for illness or injury and the maximum benefit period is 13 weeks.  Employees are required to exhaust all of their accumulated sick leave and any leave that has been donated to them from other employees prior to receiving STD benefits.  During the period for which an employee is receiving STD benefits, the premium is waived.  

Not all OCC employees will have a need for this coverage because many of them have accrued enough paid sick leave to cover their absence during a period of short-term disability, which is the first 13 weeks of their disability.  OCC employees accrue four (4) hours of sick leave per biweekly pay period and can accumulate up to an unlimited amount.  Therefore, even though the OCC employs approximately 2,900 employees, only 1,659 employees are targeted as potential enrollees based on their sick leave balance being less than 585 hours of sick leave.  Currently, 524 employees are enrolled in the program.  The OCC hires approximately 150 to 200 employees every year and it would be expected that at least 50 percent of those newly hired employees would elect STD coverage.

Under the OCC LTD program, the elimination period is 90 days and the benefit is 60 percent of monthly earnings, up to a maximum of $10,000 a month.  The LTD benefit is offset by other income benefits (e.g. federal retirement benefits and social security benefits, etc.) and provides for a minimum monthly disability benefit of $100. 

A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL WILL BE POSTED ON/BEFORE MAY 1, 2007.

All responsible insurance carrier, please submit questions to  
Cheryl Battle by April 24.

<DESC>The Government has identified a requirement to procure 750 PIEZO Cables/Pin assemblies to support the Joint Navy/AF effort to test the ignitability of PBXN-109 with 3 types of fuze boosters (Tetryl, N-7, and CH-6).

This is a sole source procurement because all of the previous testing in the series was performed with this specific instrumentation and modifying the test setup can have a detrimental effect on the comparability of future tests to previous ones, which is a required element; and these pins/cables are compatible with our testing instrumentation that records the data.
The contractor shall fabricate cables using the following parts in accordance with the Navy test requirements:
Item 1, 750 ea  PIEZO PIN # CA-1136 x 1 inch
Item 2, 750 ea  Cable assembly # CA-111146-3*25 Feet.        

The 750 Piezo Cables are required to be delivered by 1 Aug 07.

The Piezo Cables shall be delivered to:

<DESC>SCOPE OF WORK:  The contractor is to furnish labor, materials and associated reqirmentd good to produce High resolution satellite imagery data for the Hiawatha Project Area.  Background and Purpose: This project involves acquiring high-resolution satellite-imagery data collection. Provide imagery data with sufficient pixel resolution to map human activities associated with energy extraction and reclamation.  The project area arises from a proposal by Questar Exploration & Production Company, Wexpro Company, and other natural gas development companies to further develop natural gas resources within the existing Canyon Creek, Trail and Kinney natural gas fields (also known as the Vermillion Basin area) in Sweetwater County, Wyoming, and the East and West Hiawatha/Sugarloaf Fields in Moffat County, Colorado.  The BLM will be preparing an Environmental Impact Statement for the Hiawatha Project and plans on using the imagery as baseline for quantifying and assessing future activities. Medium-resolution data, such as LANDSAT, have proved their utility for mapping large geographic areas, but the level of detail that one can extract from them for site-specific applications is somewhat limited.  For such applications, aerial photographs are often used, however, expense has somewhat limited their use for repeat applications.  The purpose of this scope of work is to procure high-resolution satellite-imagery.. Requires a satellite system that provides imagery data with sufficient pixel resolution to meet technical requirements of the studies mentioned in the previous paragraph. Requirements:  "	Imagery-data acquisition will occur between May 28 through July 15, 2007, the period of optimal vegetative vigor.  "	Maximum Cloud-cover specification will be less than 20 percent for all data.  "	Radiometric and sensor corrections shall be applied to the imagery data. "	Refined data will be Digital DOQQs from satellite imagery at 60cm resolution. "	Imagery data will be projected using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates with the NAD83 datum, Zone 12.  "	Delivered imagery-data format will be GeoTiff 1.0 and compatible with ERDAS Imagine image processing software. "	Delivered imagery-data will include a license for unlimited distribution to civil agencies. Interested parties who have this capability please contact Susan_Nagel@blm.gov please email qualifications by COB 21 May 2007 for consideration.  We have a short window of performance.   Susan Nagel 307-775-6056, please let me also have your DUnns number and business size in email.  High Resolution is key*****

<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS RESERVED AS AN (Competitive 8A SET-ASIDE), ONLY ELIGIBLE COMPANIES SHOULD RESPOND TO THIS REQUEST.

This activity will build on Successful Investment in Knowledge Management & Communications and Training activities to promote adoption of good practice in microenterprise development activities. 

Specifically, whereas USAID?s Microenterprise Development office has successfully supported knowledge sharing, learning, communications and training activities through its Accelerated Microenterprise Advancement Project (AMAP) IQC.  This support will now be combined into a single contract that will coordinate learning across the entire office portfolio, including AMAP, the Implementation Grant Program and its associated learning networks, the FIELD-Support Leader With Associates, and the Grants Under Contract mechanism, as well as other current and future microenterprise investments. T

The intent is to extend current learning activities, expand into new areas of learning and knowledge sharing, and gain economies of scale and synergy by combining all microenterprise learning activities in a single contract covering the full range of microenterprise activities.

The Performance-Based Contract to be awarded will aim to increase the application of microenterprise good practice by engaging the global microenterprise community in capturing, disseminating and applying microenterprise knowledge, though web-enabled collaboration, in-person and distance/virtual training, seminars and conferences, learning networks and peer assistance among USAID partners, communications efforts aimed at broad dissemination of innovations, and other activities. 

As a result of this activity, USAID expects to see improved program design, implementation and results yielding improved performance of financial markets in extending financial services to poor and very poor clients; and programs that increase microenterprise productivity through policy reform that removes barriers to (and lowers costs of) entering the formal sector, and through enterprise initiatives that increase the competitiveness of small and microenterprises in productive value chains. The KMD activity is expected to work in tandem to the maximum extent feasible with other ongoing and planned USAID development activities.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR 13.5 Test Program for Commercial Items, FAR 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a Request for Quotation (RFQ) is being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Solicitation number is N00244-07-T-X001. This solicitation is restricted. NAICS Code 561621 and business size standard of $11.5 MILLION is applicable. See the attached statement of work for full explanation of the requirement.  The intent of this pilot program is to evaluate an effective installation access control system for potential implementation throughout the Department of the Navy (DON).  With this philosophy in mind, the Government will evaluate the Contractors proposal based on the following factors (listed in descending order of importance): (i) Proposed Cost/Price; (ii) Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) to install system and enroll personnel to a level where potential manpower savings can be achieved; (iii)	Past performance of Contractors system at other Government installations;   (iv) Joint base interoperability; (v) Potential for manpower savings without decreasing current Force Protection effectiveness; and (vi) usability and throughput of commercial vehicles, with particular emphasis on reducing wait times for commercial vehicles. Best value source selection procedures as defined in FAR Part 15 will be used.  This pilot program applies to the specific areas of Navy Region Southwest only.  This pilot program does not conflict with the Navy Enterprise-wide solution being investigated under GSA RFI DKTD07CB003S originally issued 29 January 2007.  All data and associated findings of this pilot program may be shared with higher authority. The Government is seeking a Contractor willing to install its access control system, whereby !  the Government will not be liable for any funds; consideration shall be solely in the form of access to facilities on an exclusive basis to establish a pilot program.  Accordingly, any funds to be paid to the contractor shall be made directly to the Contractor by vendors,  contractors, and other agencies servicing CNRSW that choose to participate in the pilot program. However, If a vendor chooses to submit a priced proposal, it shall be evaluated only in the event funds can be made available and it is otherwise determined in the Governments best interest in accordance with the aforementioned Best Value criteria.  Proposals shall be submitted on CD-ROM media only; paper copies will not be accepted.  Proposal CDs may include multiple files in Microsoft applications (Word or Excel) or Adobe Acrobat; individual files should not exceed 5MB in size.  Proposal CDs are due by 10:00 AM Pacific time on June 20, 2007 to Bradley Crawford, Contracting Officer, FISC San Diego, 937 Nor!  th Harbor Drive, Suite 719, San Diego, CA 92132.  Al requests for info rmation shall be directed to the Contracting Officer only and shall be submitted in writing via e-mail to the e-mail address listed in this notice.   The Government will award a Firm Fixed Price purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous and considered the Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate the quotation: (i) Technical capability of the product being offered. To be determined technically acceptable, the contractor must furnish technical information in accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(4). It is preferred that technical information be provided in Adobe pdf file format, if possible. Contractors offering an equal product to the product required by the Government are required to furnish complete technical specifications of the offered product. Failure to provide this information may render the quotation unacceptable for award based on the Contracting Officers determination. (ii) Past Performance: Provide Past Performance data on your companies !  two most recently completed Federal Government contracts (Not to exceed (3) years since completion) for like or similar material required by this solicitation. If you do not have Federal Government contracts, list State, Local or commercial contracts. Provide contract number, date of contract, quantity, unit price, and model/part number of product sold. Provide name of Government activity or commercial company, point of contact/phone number. This Performance data will be used to evaluate your companies past performance in meeting contract cost/price, technical and delivery objectives. (iii) Pricing: Contractors must provide current pricing for each CLIN specified and a total cost for all material inclusive of transportation costs to San Diego, CA 92135. Pricing will be evaluated against other quotations received. Transportation costs quoted separately of the unit price are considered part of the quotation and will be evaluated accordingly. Only quotations which have been de!  termined to have met all factors will be considered for award. Ability  to meet the requirements set forth in this RFQ shall be demonstrated by the contractors submission of a signed quotation which has not taken exception to the schedule. Quotations which take exception and do not meet the Governments requirement may be determined to be unacceptable and not considered for award. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate quotations without discussions and award a Firm Fixed Price purchase order. Each initial offer should, therefore contain the contractors best terms from both a technical, delivery and pricing standpoint. The Government reserves the right to make award to other than low offeror when it has been determined by the Contracting Officer to be in the best interest of the Government.

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center - Training Systems Division (NAWC-TSD) has a requirement to provide curriculum and courseware support for the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA). The CNATRA mission is to train Pilots, Undergraduate Military Flight Officers (UMFOs) and Enlisted Air Crewmen for the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as several foreign countries, through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.  The overall goal / objective is to produce military qualified aviators that meet the skill requirements of a diverse client base optimized to a production and completion schedule that integrates with customer demand. The Assistant Chief of Staff (ACOS) for Aviation Training and Standardization, CNATRA N7, is tasked with a continuing requirement to maintain the currency, efficiency and effectiveness of all curricular materials.  This tasking requires the continual update, modification, amendment, enhancement and standardization of approximately 30% or less of all aviation training curricula, courseware and instructional support materials.  In addition, this N7 tasking includes management, organizational support, labor, equipment, training facilities, tools, training devices, supervision and other services necessary to support all Naval Air Training Command (NATRACOM) classroom, simulator, and flight training programs, to include extensive on-site support at the locations identified below. Located at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas, the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) oversees the Naval Air Training Command (NATRACOM), which includes five Training Air Wings located on five Naval Air Stations in Florida, Mississippi, and Texas.  The five wings are home to 17 Training Squadrons.  In addition, Joint Services Training (JST) is also conducted with the Air Force on bases in Georgia, Oklahoma, and Texas.  There are six NATRACOM locations that support the primary mission of the CNATRA, including the N7 centrally managed Flight Training Support Center (FTSC). NATRACOM squadrons log approximately 400,000 flight hours each year in seven types of training aircraft/platforms with a total compliment of over 750 airplanes.  More than 1,800 pilots and Naval Flight Officers (NFOs) earn their Wings of Gold from the NATRACOM annually.  These six NATRACOM locations include:

CNATRA N7  Flight Training Support Center (FTSC), NAS Corpus Christi, TX
Training Air Wing One, NAS Meridian, MS
Training Air Wing Two, NAS Kingsville, TX
Training Air Wing Four, NAS Corpus Christi, TX
Training Air Wing five, NAS Whiting Field, FL
Training Air Wing Six, NAS Pensacola, FL

This effort is to provide direct support for all NATRACOM curricula, courseware, and training materials, centrally managed and maintained by the Flight Training Support Center (FTSC), satisfying the Command's aviation training requirements within a well timed, efficient, and accurate corporate continuum.  The FTSC is composed of the Operational Support Segment (OSS), which includes Training Integration Management System (TIMS) product development, the Curriculum and Courseware Support Segment (CSS), and the Configuration Management and Quality Control Support Segment (CM/QC-SS); all Support Segments are dedicated to direct operational/functional training support.  The FTSC Support Segments are critical elements of the NATRACOM training environment and crucial to primary mission objectives.  Present course material is undergoing conversion to Authorware 7.0. The Contractor shall deliver to the Government all source data, training products, courseware, publicatons, software, hardware, documentation, data rights, and operating licenses procured / developed for, or incidental to, this Contract effort.  This total effort involves roughly 29 aviation curricula, 825+ Computer Based Training (CBT) lessons, and approximately 135 aviation training technical documents/publications.  Contractor activities will include the design, development, changes, revision ( 30 to 50% or less ) and maintenance, conversion, testing, documentation, training, deployment, establishing and tracking the inter-dependent relationships and operational support of all CNATRA Headquarters and NATRACOM aviation training curricula, courseware, and training materials/publications.  This requirement also includes: Instructional System Design (ISD); courseware authoring; technical publication support; program/project management; configuration management and quality control; and data management. 

In addition, the contractor shall provide process-engineering support that is focused on a continuous process improvement that increases the quality of the product and services provided to the CNATRA and NATRACOM customer base. The selected contractor must be able to comply with Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI)-Level 3.  A critical element of the CNATRA corporate business process, which includes the contract work-force, is effective utilization and implementation of Operational Risk Management (ORM).  Structurally, the NATRACOM and CNATRA staff utilize microcomputer based client server technology hardware, software and network to support current and future requirements. The Government intends to conduct a competitive acquisition under the 8(a) Program per FAR SubPart 19.8.  The resultant contract is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with a five year ordering period with both Fixed Price and Cost contract type elements.  The Government further anticipates a $40M contract over a 60-month period. Detailed requirements for specific tasks will be issued as task/delivery orders for a task or combination of tasks under the contract. It is anticipated that the contracted effort will take the form of a combination SOO/SOW, with written proposals supported by an oral component.  A secret clearance is required to work on this project.

<DESC>GULPORT BOS:  SET-ASIDE FOR HUBZone AND Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business.  The outcomes to be satisfied are Base Operations Facility Support Contracting for the following specific services:  Janitorial,  Refuse Collection and Recycling, Grounds Maintenance at the following locations:  Naval Construction Battalion Center (NCBC), Gulfport, Mississippi; Keesler Rifle Range; Naval Station (NAVSTA) Pascagoula, Mississippi; Human Resources Center Southeast (HRSC SE), Naval Special Boat Team (SBT-22), Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVO), and Naval Special Warfare Center (NAVSCIATTS) at Stennis Space Center, Mississippi

The outcomes are performance based. The Contractor?s performance will be evaluated according to the following criteria:  Past Performance, Management, Technical Approach/Methods, and Price.  The price evaluation will be approximately equal to the sum of the three technical performance criteria.  From a technical perspective, the criteria for evaluation will center on the offeror?s ability to perform contracts of this size and scope.  These services are currently being performed under three existing contracts as follows:  Refuse:  WASTE MANAGEMENT OF MISSISSIPPI, P. O. BOX 3869, GULFPORT, MS  39505, Expiration 30 SEP 07, Monthly FFP  $50,538.41, Gov't POC: Robin Fowler (228) 871-4274 --- Custodial:  EASTERN MAINTENANCE AND SERVICES INC., PO BOX 669, COATS, NC  27521-0669, Expiration 30 SEP 07, Monthly FFP  $90,483.00, Gov't POC_Bennie Boren (228) 871-4031 --- Grounds:  BTC CONTRACT SERVICES INC., PO BOX 7286, 1879 WHITE LAKE DRIVE, WHITE LAKE, NC  28337, (910) 862-6393, Expiration 30 SEP 07, Monthly FFP  $50,194.28, Gov't POC: Cara Morano (228) 377-8577 X129

Although this contract is not exceptionally complex or of a significant dollar value, because it is a 100% competitive set-aside for HUB Zone Small Business and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), the Government is most interested in the offeror?s ability to manage multi-disciplines of non-technical specialties such as Refuse, Custodial, and Grounds.

NAICs Code is 561210, Facility Support Services, and the business size standard is $32.5 Million. 

The contract performance period is for one year starting 01 OCT 07 through 30 SEP 08.  The contract will contain options for four (4) additional one-year performance periods, to be exercised at the Government?s discretion.  Options are not guaranteed.

The minimum guarantee will be the Firm Fixed Price (FFP) portion of the work.  Additional work may be ordered under the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Line items at the prices established at the beginning of the contract.

The maximum value of the contract, and the price upon which it will be evaluated, will be the sum of the FFP and IDIQ work for the base and all option periods.

The procurement will be via competitive negotiated proposals (not sealed bid) amongst HUBZone and SDVO Small Businesses.  This is a 100% set-aside for HUBZone and SDVOSB but it is recognized that Refuse Collection/Disposal and Recycling may have to be subcontracted to a large business.

The government does not intend to use FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.

The current and potential risks for this contract are no more than for a typical small BOS type contract.  The only foreseeable Schedule and Performance risks are those associated with seasonal destructive weather.  This contract will not contain any incentive award provisions, fee, or periods.

The solicitation will be posted to The Navy?s ESOL Site http://esol.navfac.navy.mil under the solicitation number N69450-07-R-0762.  It will not be available for downloading until June 1, 2007.  The solicitation will not be provided in hard copy.  All interested firms must enter, register, and download the documents through ESOL.  Once the solicitation is available it will direct you to the location and time for a site visit along with points of contact for the solicitation.  The site visit is tentatively scheduled for 14 JUN 2007, deadline for receipt of questions will be 19 JUN 2007.  Proposals will be due 02 JUL 2007 and due to heavy year end workload, the Navy does not intend to extend that deadline.

<DESC>On April 18, 2003, the staff of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) forwarded to the Commission SECY-03-0059, "NRC's Advanced Reactor Research Program."  This document provided the staff's assessment of NRC's advanced reactor technical infrastructure development and safety research that would be needed to support the review of new and advanced reactor applications planned and envisioned at that time.  A new draft was created recently "Advanced Reactor Research Program" (Agency-wide Documents Access and Management System, ADAMS, ML070740637) which identified several research tasks under the thermal-fluids and accident analysis technical areas; the first of which is the completion of R&D phenomena tables for a generic high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) design.  This involved an assessment of the current knowledge base associated with the identified phenomena to aid in developing analytical tools and technical bases to perform safety analyses and regulatory reviews, and the scope of technology development needs to support HTGR licensing, including both air-cooled and water cooled reactor cavity cooling systems (RCCSs).  

Under this requirement, the contractor shall capture all contributing heat transfer mechanisms that impact the heat rejection capacity of the RCCS: radiation, convection, and conduction for both the air-cooled and water-cooled designs.  The selected tools have to be consistent with the large scale of and RCCS, as well as the operating regimes expected during normal and accident conditions.  Simulations shall account for changes in the heat rejection capability of the RCCS induced by heterogeneous boundary conditions, e.g., coolant mass flow rate and temperature distribution at the inlet, vessel heat flux discontinuities, flow obstructions, and emissivity variations.  Special attention shall be given to the influence of dust on local heat transfer phenomena.

It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract. 

The period of performance of the resultant contract will be eighteen (18) months. 

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about June 1, 2007 and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website. Hard copies of the solicitation document and its related documents, as appropriate, will not be available. Because this solicitation and its related documents, as appropriate, will be posted at this website, interested parties are instructed NOT to send letters or e-mails or faxes requesting the RFP. Telephoned, e-mailed, or faxed requests for the RFP will not be accepted. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. 

The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. 

The size standard for this solicitation is average annual receipts of $4.5 million over the past three years, as set forth under NAICS 541330.  

Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns, i.e., large businesses, small businesses, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   An opportunity analysis by the USEPA concluded that the commodity "laboratory supplies" was an excellent commodity for strategic sourcing.  This is a high volume commodity that is currently being acquired by each of the Agency's laboratories in small individual purchases from an array of suppliers, predominantly via the government purchase card.  Eight distinct commodity categories for laboratory supplies will be strategically sourced under the solicitation: Plasticware, Glassware, Reagents/Media, Standards Sample Containers, Disposables/Consumables, Personal  Protection Equipment, and Solvents/Acids/Bases. The selected offerors must provide laboratory supplies for each of the the eight commodity categories., In addition to providing supplies that meet standard specifications under each commodity category, the offeror will need to have access to  products from a variety of suppliers, including brand name supplies (i.e., supplies unique to certain manufacturers) under each commodity category and be capable of recognizing their product numbers. The solicitation will be 100% set-aside for small businesses.  Accordingly, all small businesses  having the appropriate North American Classification System (NAICS) code(s) may submit proposals.  All offers from responsive and responsible sources will be considered. The following shall be included in the solicitation: 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside and 52.21-14, Limitations  on Subcontracting.

<DESC>Diesel Laboratory Water Recovery System
Specifications


The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) Approval and Certification Center (A&CC) in Triadelphia, WV, operates a diesel engine test laboratory.  Currently, the water cooled eddy current engine dynamometers are provided with city water which is dumped into the environment after a single pass through a dynamometer.  This cooling method is financially and ecologically unsound prompting A&CC to recover coolant water.  MSHA is soliciting bids for the purchase and installation of a water recovery system for the two (2) dynamometers.   The dynamometers are not operated simultaneously.  
The maximum cooling requirement for the dynamometers is:  
1.	maximum coolant inlet temperature = 90o F
2.	maximum coolant outlet temperature = 150o F
3.	flow rate = 50 gpm
4.	minimum dyno inlet water pressure = 40 psi
5.	coolant = water
6.	The proposed water cooling system provided by the contractor will consist of:
a.	Closed circuit cooling tower capable of cooling the dynamometer water from 150o F to 90o F at 76 o F wet-bulb temperature at a water flow rate of 50 gpm.  The primary means of cooling shall not be evaporative.  The material of construction of the tower shall be corrosion resistant and include a sump pump motor and basin heater with thermostat control.
b.	Minimum Pump specification 50 gpm @ 140 ? head with flanges.
c.	A holding tank buried below grade (below frost line) outside the laboratory.  This sump tank will have ample capacity (approximately 300 gallons) to serve the cooling tower and larger dyno and be located at a level to allow all dyno and cooling tower water to drain into it when not in use.  The contractor shall dig a hole to an appropriate depth (below frost line), and line the walls and floor of the hole with concrete.  The size of the hole shall be adequate to accommodate the contractor supplied holding tank.  The holding tank shall include a float assembly (to maintain proper water level), fill valve, drains and required inlet and outlet piping connections.  The holding tank shall include a port or some means  to allow the holding tank to periodically drained of its water.  The holding tank shall include a cover for tank protection and access to piping. 
d.	Complete supply and return piping system with steel pipe, valves, fittings, couplings, hanger materials, water make-up system, drain piping, and tie-in to existing dyno supply and return piping.
e.	Complete power and control wiring with wire, conduit, fittings, starters, disconnect switches, breakers, and support materials.
f.	The system design will be such that A&CC can operate the water recovery system or revert to city water if the system malfunctions.
7.	Description of proposed operation.
a.	The 4 inch dyno drain lines will connect to the holding tank buried outside the laboratory.  Hot water from a dyno in use will gravity feed to the holding tank.  The 50 gpm pump will pump water from the holding tank to the cooling tower which will cool the water and provide the dyno in use with cooling water.  Each dyno has a ball valve installed at its water inlet and lab personnel will manually open the ball valve for the dyno in use before the cooling system is turned on.  The water level for the system will be automatically maintained at its proper level.  When the system is shut down, all water from the dyno in use and the water tower will drain into the holding tank.  
8.	Relative location of components:
a.	Holding tank location will be outside the lab in a mutually agreed upon location.
b.	Cooling tower shall be located on the existing concrete pad adjacent to the diesel lab and outside the lab?s rest room.

<DESC>The Space Innovation development Center (SIDC) TENCAP intends to pursue a sole-source follow-on effort with Near Space Corporation (NSC) for Talon TOPPER System Refinement.  NSC, 6000 Hangar Road, P.O. Box 909, Tillamook, OR 97141, previously performed this effort under the Talon TOPPER II program under Contract FA2550-05-C-8889.  This contract ended on 30 Mar 06, and was performed through a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Some of the tasks in the previous contract were not completed.  

The TOPPER system consists of Tactical Balloon Systems, Return Vehicle, Payload Integration, Ground Support Equipment, and Talon SHU Module.  The system is also supported by a mission planning and flight monitoring system called Talon SHU, the High Altitude Mission Support System (HAMSS).  The balloon provides a low cost expendable system to loft the payload and maintain it in the high altitude environment (65K-100k feet) during mission operation.  The payload is integrated with the Payload Return Vehicle (PRV) to provide for the safe return of the payload.  After landing, the vehicle can be serviced, prepared for another sortie with a new expendable balloon, and relaunched as required. Alternatively, when persistence is required, constellation replenishment can be accomplished by launching new platforms while others are returning.  Talon TOPPER Phase III will provide further refinement to prepare the system for future operations.  Phase III will also provide equipment, training and training materials for the TOPPER system

Phase I of Talon TOPPER performed a high altitude system trade study to exploit lift and guided recovery vehicle technologies.  Phase I evaluated high altitude system options and compared performance, costs, and operational constraints.  It also determined the performance specifications for Phase II and initial deployment. 

Phase II of Talon TOPPER included demonstration of Tactical Balloon Systems, Return Vehicle, Payload Integration, Ground Support Equipment, and Talon SHU Module Integration.

In Phase III of Talon TOPPER the contractor will perform limited system refinements and improvements to the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the TOPPER ground control station as well as integrate and extensively test/ document improvements to SHU to ready the system for future operations.    The contractor will also provide a payload pod Interface Control Document (ICD).  The contractor will develop training material for the TOPPER/SHU system and perform training of government designated personnel.  As the culmination of this contract the contractor will plan, perform, and document an operational utility demonstration of the entire TOPPER system.  The contractor shall be responsible for TOPPER system production to support testing, training, an operational demonstration, and end-deliverables under this contract to include PRVs, balloons, and ground control and support equipment.  The contractor may perform system characterization (priced option)  and perform a study on incorporating a transponder into the PRV (priced option).  The contractor may also develop service/repair procedures (priced option).
NSC has access to proprietary manufacturing/engineering information not available in existing government specifications, drawings, and manuals.  To maintain continuity for future TENCAP requirements a follow-on contract with an eight-month period of performance is contemplated.  The estimated budget for this effort is $900,000.

This synopsis is a notice of intent to award a sole-source contract to NSC and shall not be construed as a request for offers.  However, interested parties are invited to submit a statement of technical capabilities not to exceed ten (10) pages that includes the following information:  1)  Company name, mailing address, points of contacts, and telephone numbers;  2) Business size classification, Large, Small, or Other;  3) Experience in operating and developing free-floating high-altitude systems with payload return capability.  The Statement of Capabilities must be submitted by COB 02 Jun 07.  The Government will not pay any costs associated with preparation of the Statement of Capabilities.  All written correspondence shall be submitted to SIDC/TCZ, Attn: Anne Jackson (Contracting Officer), 730 Irwin Ave., Suite 83, Schriever AFB, CO 80912.  Direct technical questions to Capt Jason McGrogan, (719) 721-7658.  Anne Jackson can be contacted for contractual matters at (719) 721-9044.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB) proposes to acquire, on a sole source basis with Sharon Mavroukakis, Rockville, Maryland  20850 to provide senior research nurse consultant support.  The POB develops new therapies to improve the survival and quality of life for individuals with childhood cancers.  The conduct of biomedical research is complex and increasingly fraught with complicated regulatory requirements.  The Principal Investigators (PI) of the Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB) are dedicated to the study and treatment of childhood cancer.  During the past decade, there has been considerable progress in understanding fundamental processes in the pathogenesis of pediatric cancers.  New insights in the cell biology, immunology and molecular genetics of specific cancers have led to new targets for therapy.  After extensive laboratory research of potential new cancer treatments, the Principal Investigators in POB must engage in a long regulatory review process prior to the initiation of a clinical research protocol. That review process includes a peer review of the clinical trial plan or research protocol, followed by a scientific review by the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC) of the CCR, NCI.  Once that review is completed, additional review, documentation and oversight is required by a sponsor, the Institutional Review Board (NCI IRB) and/or an Investigational New Drug (IND) application is filed with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA ).  This lengthy process is extremely time consuming, requiring extensive labor hours, which normally delays the successful and timely completion of research due to conflicting PI priorities.  The contractor shall support research protocol writing and revisions, draft standard and ad hoc reports, and assist in the maintenance of office documents and records.  On occasion the contractor shall oversee study monitoring and/or data collection.   To perform this work a contractor must meet the following minimum qualifications:  The contractor shall have a college science degree master?s and a minimum of five (5) years work experience in these areas: 1) writing biomedical research protocol documents including study design and informed consents; 2) preparing applications for the following Regulatory Offices reviewing biomedical research: Office of Biotechnology Activities (OBA), NIH and Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), NIH and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) applications; 3) preparing documents for NCI Institutional Review Boards (IRB) that comply with FDA and Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP), HHS mandated guidelines and procedures.   Tasks 1 -3 require extensive knowledge of and application of the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Public Welfare, PART 46, Protection of Human Subjects; TITLE 21?Food and Drugs, and NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH GUIDELINES).   The tasks the contractor will be required to perform are as follows:  1)  Review Pediatric Oncology Branch biomedical research protocols during the development phase and make recommendations in writing:  a) review formatting and content to meet the NCI IRB requirements (http://home.ccr.cancer.gov/IRB/index.htm); b) 5-10 new protocols per quarter;  c )  completion of document review within seven (7) business days, with corrections returned within 2 business days; and d)  recommendations will be documented in the protocol file in the Pediatric Oncology Branch Server via remote applications (http://remoteapps.nci.nih.gov/) according to established POBPSO procedures, which will be provided to the contractor;  2)  Write informed consent documents with review/input of the Principal Investigator, according to NCI IRB requirements (http://home.ccr.cancer.gov/IRB/index.htm);  a)  5-10 informed consent documents per quarter;  3)  Write/coordinate documents for submission and response to stipulations for the PRMC, IRB, and sponsor(s) according to agency/review body policies and procedures and established POBPSO procedures, which will be provided to the contractor;  a)  10-20 documents, including Response memorandum, copy of protocol document with changes underlined, copy of protocol document with changes accepted, copy of consent document with changes underlined, copy of consent document with changes accepted; and b)Completion of document review within seven (7) business days, with corrections returned within 2 business days;  4)  Draft IND submission packages according to CFR 21 Part 312 and coordinate with the Pediatric Oncology Branch Protocol Support Office submission to the FDA according to established POBPSO procedures, which will be provided to the contractor.  a)  3-4 IND submission packages per annum, to be completed within 2 weeks of NCI IRB approval of the research protocol according to CFR 21 Part 312; and 5)  Draft OBA applications according to NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH GUIDELINES) for assigned gene therapy research trials (http://www4.od.nih.gov/oba/Rdna.htm) and established POBPSO procedures, which will be provided to the contractor.  Sharon Mavroukakis is the only known source to the NCI Researcher who possesses the skills and expertise to perform the work as outlined above.  Sharon Mavroukakis brings to the POB highly unique expertise in the regulatory requirements for the writing and execution of clinical trials for children with cancer at the NCI.  The contractor brings over 20 years of experience in the conduct of translational trials in oncology at the NCI and therefore is able to provide the investigators in the POB with expert support in generating the requirements necessary for regulatory approval of new clinical trials.  Specifically, Ms. Mavroukakis aids clinical investigators in the POB in the writing of clinical trials with a focus on ensuring that all specific regulatory requirements for the scientific review committees, institutional review board, Cancer Therapeutic Evaluation Program, NIH Ethics Guidelines and FDA requirements are met.  In addition, Ms. Mavroukakis provides expertise in writing of Investigational New Drug Applications for submission for the FDA and provides oversight for adverse event reporting for clinical trials.

Justification:  

The laboratory currently has 98 active patents related to antibody and immunotoxin design, construction and production and genes identified as potential targets for immunotherapy of cancer. Five of the laboratorys immunotoxins are currently in Phase1/Phase2 clinical trials and generate considerable research. Two of the laboratorys monoclonal antibodies are being marketed for licensing and distribution.  The NCI is continuously making and improving immunotoxins and other proteins used to study their activity and effectiveness.  The proteins are made in E coli and purified by FPLC. 

Benefit

The results of such studies, as mentioned above, are expected to yield new information regarding ways to diagnose, interrupt, prevent and otherwise treat the spread of cancer.  In addition, it is highly likely that the identification of novel biomarkers applicable to patient diagnostics will result.  For example, preliminary studies are underway to correlate mesothelin with human ovarian, lung, and pancreatic cancer with the cancer burden using purified antibodies to mesothelin.  These are expected to permit the filing of intellectual property claims based upon research performed with this instrument.

The AKTA FPLC system enables the NCI to perform separations based on a variety of sample characteristics, such as molecular weight, net surface charge, hydrophobicity, or affinity while retaining biological activity.  The AKTA FPLC Systems are controlled with Unicorn - GE Healthcare?s AKTA FPLC system controller software, which is already in use in the laboratory.  The AKTA FPLC Systems must be able to utilize Pharmacia HR16/10, HR 5/5, Mono Q 5/50 GL, HiPrep 16/60 and Tosoh TSK-GE chromatography columns already in use in the laboratory.

<DESC>The Department of State, Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, Office of Aviation (INL/A) has identified a requirement to acquire an Infrared (IR) small arms detection system supporting INL/A operations.  

This is an INL/A initiative to rapidly field a small arms detection and warning system for aircrew alert and situational awareness of active threat weapons firings.  This program is designed to increase the safety and survival of aircrews and their mission aircraft by alerting them, in near real-time (less than 1 second), of hostile fire events in order to avoid them.  The system will be integrated in an INL/A OV-10D and flown to verify and demonstrate its effectiveness.  Additionally, the event will be transmitted to an additional aircraft flying in support.  The system on the support aircraft will consist of a display and the necessary datalink equipment to receive the alert information in the form of a geo-rectified position and basic vector to the point of origin of the event.

This requirement includes installation of the required system sensors on an INL/A OV-10D and demonstration of the effectiveness of the system in CONUS.  Once successfully tested in CONUS the system will be moved to a TBD OCONUS location for demonstration to prove the system in the actual operational environment.  This effort provides aircrews the opportunity to see and verify the system capabilities and allows for user input before determining if the effort should be continued on a larger number of aircraft in the INL/A fleet.  As a baseline, the aircraft will be outfitted with a system providing a minimum of 240 degrees (preferably 360 degrees) of horizontal coverage. 

A draft copy of the solicitation statement of work is provided for industy comment before the final solicitation is released.     Comments on the draft solicitation statement of work may be emailed to Patrick Murphy - murphypj@state.gov.

NOTICE?Compliance with FAR 52.219-6

A recent decision by the U.S. Small Business Administration clarified the requirements to comply with FAR 52.219-6 when the end product is a kit.  Because the kit assembly process is not manufacturing, offerors may not qualify as a manufacturer or non-manufacturer.  Offerors may qualify as a small business concern as a kit assembler under 13 C.F.R. Section 121.406(c).  To qualify as a kit assembler, the offering firm must not exceed 500 employees and 50% of the total value of the kit?s components must be manufactured by small business concerns that qualify as small under the NAICS code for the components being assembled.  The calculation excludes the value of those components that must be purchased from either government sources or concerns other than small.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>**** This is a modification to the original Sources Sought notice published on May 15, 2007.  The original notice incorrectly identified the NAICS code.  The correct code is 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.****

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small businesses and 8(a) firms to conduct a threat assessment and pilot surveillance project for the newly established Papahnaumokukea Marine National Monument (Monument)
On June 15, 2006, George Bush established Monument by Proclamation 8031 to ensure the comprehensive, strong, and lasting protection of the coral reef ecosystem and related marine resources and species of the region. These waters contain a large portion of all coral reefs found in the United States' jurisdiction and support more than 7,000 marine species, of which one quarter are unique to the Hawaiian Islands chain.  The 1200-mile stretch of remote islands, atolls and reefs, is also the most remote archipelago in the world. 
  
Due to the size of the NWHI region, its remote location, and the multi-jurisdictional nature of management in the area, a threat assessment geared at the protection of the resources from the deep ocean to the land has not been conducted.  Characterizing and evaluating threats to the area coming from human activities such as illegal access, poaching, and unforeseen concerns arising from innovations in maritime technology will be an important part of this assessment.  Threats to the NWHI have been previously researched through the identification of a number of relevant data sets and an enforcement workshop geared at identifying solutions to remote enforcement issues in the area.  However, these have not been comprehensively evaluated or prioritized.  Therefore, the first task is to conduct a thorough threat assessment working with the co-trustee management agencies (NOAA, USFWS, and the State of Hawaii), the U.S. Coast Guard, Department of Defense, and relevant non-governmental entities.  This assessment will utilize to the extent necessary, public, commercial, classified and de-classified data to identify threats.  These threats should be prioritized by potential impact and probability of occurring, as well as geographically referenced.

The second task includes a review of the threat assessment with the management and enforcement agencies and an evaluation of existing assets for surveillance.  AIS, RadarSat imagery and sonar buoy arrays have been used by various agencies in the past, and potentially could be woven together for Monument management purposes in the future.  Identifying and evaluating these assets are important steps in creating an effective surveillance plan for the Monument.  The applicant should have DOD security clearance that would allow them to evaluate the utility of military assets and data sets for surveillance purposes.  

Many surveillance tools have been proposed for the Monument, including satellite surveillance, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), radar, AIS, SONAR arrays, etc.  However, they have not been evaluated against a comprehensive threat assessment, and compared by cost to benefit, and feasibility.  This analysis will be used to develop a prioritized list of short, medium and long-term surveillance solutions for the Monument.

A small-scale pilot demonstration project will be selected from the prioritized list of solutions discussed above.  This project should demonstrate the capacity to conduct remote surveillance in the Monument, and should not be dependent upon the construction of significant infrastructure.

NOAA intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract for the work described above.  Firms responding to this market survey should provide only focused and pertinent information.  Offerors should include a description of significant collaboration and subcontracting that will be required to provide technically acceptable deliverables. Responding firms should provide their capability statement to Contract Specialist, Stephanie Garnett by email at Stephanie.m.garnett@noaa.gov no later than May 22, 2007. Capability Statements received after this date will not be considered.  All questions regarding this announcement should be addressed to the Contract Specialist at 808-944-2228.

<DESC>The original notice contained language that does not apply to this requirement.  Here is the corrected notice with all superfluous language removed: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR 13.5 Test Program for Commercial Items, FAR 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a Request for Quotation (RFQ) is being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is a total small business set-aside. NAICS Code 561621 and business size standard of $11.5 MILLION is applicable. See the attached statement of work for full explanation of the requirement. The intent of this pilot program is to evaluate an effective installation access control system for potential implementation throughout the Department of the Navy (DON). With this philosophy in mind, the Government will evaluate the Contractors proposal based on the following factors (listed in descending order of importance): (i) Proposed Cost/Price; (ii) Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) to install sys!  tem and enroll personnel to a level where potential manpower savings can be achieved; (iii) Past performance of Contractors system at other Government installations; (iv) Joint base interoperability; (v) Potential for manpower savings without decreasing current Force Protection effectiveness; and (vi) usability and throughput of commercial vehicles, with particular emphasis on reducing wait times for commercial vehicles. Best value source selection procedures as defined in FAR Part 15 will be used. This pilot program applies to the specific areas of Navy Region Southwest only. This pilot program does not conflict with the Navy Enterprise-wide solution being investigated under GSA RFI DKTD07CB003S originally issued 29 January 2007. All data and associated findings of this pilot program may be shared with higher authority. The Government is seeking a Contractor willing to install its access control system, whereby the Government will not be liable for any funds; consideratio!  n shall be solely in the form of access to facilities on an exclusive  basis to establish a pilot program. Accordingly, any funds to be paid to the contractor shall be made directly to the Contractor by vendors, contractors, and other agencies servicing CNRSW that choose to participate in the pilot program. However, If a vendor chooses to submit a priced proposal, it shall be evaluated only in the event funds can be made available and it is otherwise determined in the Governments best interest in accordance with the aforementioned Best Value criteria. Proposals shall be submitted on CD-ROM media only; paper copies will not be accepted. Proposal CDs may include multiple files in Microsoft applications (Word or Excel) or Adobe Acrobat; individual files should not exceed 5MB in size. Proposal CDs are due by 10:00 AM Pacific time on June 20, 2007 to Bradley Crawford, Contracting Officer, FISC San Diego, 937 North Harbor Drive, Suite 719, San Diego, CA 92132. Al requests for information shall be directed to the Contracting Officer only and shall !  be submitted in writing via e-mail to the e-mail address listed in this notice.

<DESC>This is the fourth and final set of questions and answers for the subject RFP. Q: Define "phantom" and "kited" claims. It would seem that "phantom claims" refer to claims that never existed but are being billed/paid for by OPM, but we are not sure what is referred to by "kited claims".  

A:  You are right about the phantom claims - these claims are billed, but no drugs are dispensed.  A kited claim is a claim 
that is billed for the correct drug, but for a higher quantity than was dispensed.  
 
Q: Approximately how many benefit plan definitions do you have? For example, does each BCBS plan manage the OPM coverage 
independently (i.e., is there a different formulary in every state) or do all BCBS plans administer an OPM standard plan? 

A:  All BCBS plans administer an OPM standard plan. 

Q: What is the record length for a Merck/Medco prescription claim? 

A:  There is a single file for the Merck claims that contains about 25 million claim records.  Each claim line is 417 
characters in length. 

Q: Of the 175 million claim records, how many claims are from Merck/Medco? 

A:  25 million. 

Q:  What is the record length for an Advance PCS prescription claim? How long are the claim lines?  (what is the total 
storage space required)? 

A: There are three files of Advance PCS claim data.  Each of these three files contains about 50 million claim records.  Each 
claim line is 417 characters in length.  The storage space required is 98 gigabyte. 

Q: What format is the data in? (flat, DB2, Oracle ...)? 

A: All of the files are flat files and the format for all files is a SAS dataset. 

Q: Are the rules of analysis defined? 

A: No.  

Q: How long will the analysis and claim lines be available to off site review?  (how long do we have to keep the data 
available to you)? 

A: As long as necessary to complete the analysis.  The RFP states that all work required from the vendor should be completed 
within 90 days from the date the contract is awarded. 

Q: When will the issuance of the proposal occur?  (what during the year do you expect the work to begin) 

A: We estimate that the work will begin within the next 90 days. 

Q: What platform will the analysis software be available for?  Will anaylsis be continued on our platform and system or will 
it be moved to yours and if so what type?  

A: Sun Solaris 9 operating system. 

The due date for receipt of proposals is UNCHANGED by this notice modification. Your offer must be received by 3 PM, EST, on January 29, 2004, to be considered. for the project? If it requires access to medical claims data will OIG provide the required data?

A: Yes.  OIG will provide the medical claims data needed to complete the review.  This type of review will not be performed on all of the drug claims.  We will sample some of the high dollar and/or high utilized drugs to review.

Q: The RFP states the vendor will begin work within 30 calendar days and complete the project within 90 calendar days. Considering it may take the PBMs time to send the claims data, can the completion date be contingent on receiving required data and documentation to complete the project?

A: The OIG will provide the vendor with all of the required data needed to complete the project. 

Q: Is it possible to get a database schema (such as Names of Tables, Fields, Field Sizes, and Relationships between Tables) of what is stored and would be available for the data analysis?

A: The data is not in a relational database format.  There are three files for retail pharmacy data from Advance PCS (one for each year being reviewed).  Each of these files contains about 50 million claim records.  There is a single file for the mail order drug data from Medco that contains about 25 million claim records.  All of the files are flat files.  Each file contains 109 fields.  We can provide a "field dictionary" that describes each of the fields in the files if necessary.

Q: The solicitation states that the contractor will need to provide OIG remote access to claim data/analysis.  We assume this means that OIG will need an account on our systems, or is providing OIG access to our pre-generated reports/spreadsheets (results) electronically adequate?

A: The OIG must have access to the system.  Pre-generated reports are not adequate.

Q: Can you please send me SF 1449 information and any other forms that we need to complete.

A: Government standard forms are available from various U.S. Government websites on the Internet.  For example, the SF 1449 is one of many procurement that can be downloaded from the U. S. general Services Administration website address at http://contacts.gsa.gov/webforms.nsf/93185254719078c6852569ae006af804?OpenView&Start=2.44.

ADMINISTRATIVE CORRECTIONS -- 

In the BACKGROUND section of the original, change the sentence about payments made to the two PBMs in FY 2002 to read, 

"For contract year 2002, these two PBMs were paid approximately $3 billion for benefits to BlueCross BlueShield subscribers in the FEHBP."

In the reference to the NOTICE OF TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE, the correct Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) reference is "FAR 52.219-6". The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement remains 524298, All Other Insurance Related Activities, with a small business size standard of $6 million.  

The closing date for recipt of offers (proposals) is UNCHANGED by this modification to the previous notice / solicitation.  Offers must be received by 3 PM, EST, January 22, 2004, at the Contracting Office at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, 
1900 E Street, NW, Room 1342, Washington, DC.  Please note that special safe mail handling procedures implemented by the U. S. Postal Service make timely physical delivery of mail to Federal facilities uncertain.  For this reason, faxed proposals will be accepted (followed by hard copy with original signature) to 202-606-1464.  Potential offerors are solely responsible for ensuring their offers are received at the designated place, and by the designated time, for receipt of offers.

<DESC>This modification to the original combined synopsis / solicitation provides answers to questions presented by prospective offerors regarding the requirements of this Request For Proposals (RFP), and makes administrative corrections to the earlier document.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS -- 

Q: Has there been a previous contract, if so can you provide details of the winning bid?

A: There is no previous contract for these services.

Q: What format is the data in?

A: The file format is a SAS dataset.

Q: What medium will be data be supplied on?

A: The data is stored on a Sun Microsystems server. The Government will consider handling data transfer in several ways, including (but not limited to) copying the data onto DVDs or downloading the data to the OPM mainframe and then copying it to mainframe cartridge tape.

Q: Who is the original database manufacturer (Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft, etc)?  

A: As stated earlier, the file format for all files is a SAS dataset.

Q:Will there be multiple databases? For example different data stored at BCBSA, Medco and Advance PCS?

A: All data is stored on a Sun Microsystems server in our office in Washington DC.

Q: How long is the record length?

A: The record length is 568 bytes.

Q: The RFP states that Medco/AdvancePCS were paid approximately $36 billion in 2002. Is the $36 billion number correct?

A: The RFP that was posted previously incorrectly states that the two PBMs were paid $36 billion by OPM in 2002.  $36 billion is incorrect.  The correct amount paid is $3 billion.  This distinct from the fact that OPM has paid carriers participating in the FEHBP approximately $6 billion for prescription drugs in 2002, but the $6 billion includes drug costs for ALL carriers, not just BCBS.

Q: Do you currently have pharmacy claims data from both Medco and AdvancePCS? If so, what format is the data and what media (CD or tape)?  If no, then will OPM assist in requesting data from the PBMs?

A: Yes.  The file format is a SAS dataset and is stored on a Sun Microsystems server in our office in Washington DC.

Q: Will the Blue Cross and Blue Shield PBM agreement regarding rebates from manufacturers be made available to vendors? Do the agreements have any audit clauses in them? Will there be restrictions on OIG and its vendors for retrospective audits? Will audit rights be transferred to OIG and its vendors?

A: The provider agreements between the BlueCross BlueShield Association (BCBSA) and the two PBMs have been provided to the OIG.  The OIG has also requested the contracts between the PBMs and the drug manufacturers.  All data needed to perform the objectives outlined in the RFP will be provided to the vendor.  The vendor will be required to sign a confidentiality agreement.  The contract between OPM and BCBSA includes an audit clause which permits OPM to audit certain costs associated with the PBM/BCBSA provider agreements.  The RFP's objectives outline the costs OIG will be reviewing.  There are no restrictions regarding retrospective audits.    

Q: Will OIG provide onsite office space (conference room) for audit training and vendor staff?  

A: Yes.

Q: How many auditors will attend the training program and will it be limited to one site? 

A: Six to ten auditors will require training.  The training will take place in our Washington DC office.
 
Q: Does OIG require our auditors to accompany and assist OIG audit staff during onsite visits to Medco and AdvancePCS?  If so, when are the anticipated onsite audit dates?

A: We will determine if onsite training if necessary after we receive training in our DC office.  We anticipate the onsite dates to be some time during the summer of this year.

Q: The RFP states that analysis should match drug therapy with medical diagnosis. In our experience the pharmacy claims data does not contain diagnosis codes, so medical claims data would have to be cross referenced in order to accomplish this goal. Is this necessary

<DESC>This is a third set of questions and answers for the subject RFP.

Q: In a recent modification to the solicitation, an indication was given that a field dictionary was available that includes descriptions of the fields in the standard prescription claims layout. Would it be possible to get a copy of this dictionary? 

A: The dictionary will be made available to the vendor selected to perform the contract.  The dictionary we have contains proprietary information; therefore, we cannot distribute it before a selection is made.  If you believe there is specific information that is necessary for you to submit an accurate proposal, we may be able to give you some additional information regarding the fields.

Q: I noticed in the modification that medical claims would be made available to allow for linkage of diagnosis with the pharmacy claims. Is a similar field dictionary available for this file and can we get a copy?

A: There is a dictionary for each file that will be used in the analysis.  However, as stated above, we do not wish to distribute this information until a contractor is selected.

Q: One of the requirements outlined in the solicitation is for the identification of potentially fraudulent prescription claims. One of the most basic types of fraud is the creation of claims for non-existent or non-eligible members. In order to assess whether or not such fraud exists, one must know who is eligible during any given time period. Will an eligibility file be available that will allow the contactor to assess whether or not there are claims for  non-existent or non-eligible members? And again, is a similar field dictionary available for this file and can we get a copy?

A: All information/files needed to perform the objectives listed in the RFP will be made available to the selected contractor.  Also, a dictionary will be provided for each file.

Q: The solicitation requires that the contractor evaluate whether or not the PBMs adhere to contractual agreements related to pricing, rebates, dispensing fees and other fees and practices. Is there a mechanism to access copies of the contract(s) so that we can better understand the analytic procedure that will be necessary to perform the work satisfactorily?

A: Copies of the contracts will be made available to the vendor that is selected.  However, because of the proprietary information contained in these contracts, we are not allowed to distribute these contracts.

The due date for receipt of proposals is UNCHANGED by this notice modification.  Your offer must be received by 3 PM, EST, on January 29, 2004, to be considered.

<DESC>This is a second set of questions and answers, with associated changes to the requirements of this RFP.

Q: Are only Small Businesses which meet the parameters and 
definitions per FAR 52.219-6 or NAICS 524298 (small business standard of $6 million) eligible to bid on this particular RFP?  Please clarify this "Total Small Business" set aside.

A: Upon reconsideration of the amount of data analysis required of the estimated 175 million claim records, OPM is hereby changing the NAICS code for this procurement. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is changed to 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services, with a small business size standard of $21 million.  To determine if you qualify as a small business, please refer to the guidance in FAR Part 19 (a copy is available at http://www.acqnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart_19_1.html#1047137), or consult your local U. S. Small Business office (see http://www.sba.gov/).

Also, FAR clauses 52.222-41, Service Contract Act (SCA) of 1965, as Amended, and 52.222-42, Statement of Equivalent Rates for Federal Hires, are incorporated by reference into the RFP.  U. S. Department of Labor Wage Determination No.: 1994-2103, Revision No.: 30, dated 06/03/2003, applies to this procurement.  A copy of this wage determination will either be uploaded to the FedBizOpps website for this procurement, or can be requested by e-mail to the Contracting Officer.  The applicable SCA occupational labor categories, and comparable Federal hourly labor rates, are:
* 03074 - Computer Programmer IV, $23.71 per hour
* 03103 - Computer Systems Analyst III, $23.71 per hour

Q: Most Health Plan to PBM contracts stipulate that only a 
"big four" accounting firm can review pharmaceutical rebates or claims. Therefore, the bulk of the in-depth experience from which the OIG could benefit, would reside with a firm that has been allowed to work on these types of reviews at the large PBMs including those in your RFP.

A: The clause FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside, is hereby deleted.  This procurement is now unrestricted, i.e., it is now open to competition from both large and small businesses.  Offers from all responsible sources will be considered.

Q: Under the "Proposal Submission Instructions" the RFP states we will need to describe the 5 most recent contracts completed during the past 2 years....Plus include information on all government contracts completed for the last 3 years. In our description of work....Are you looking for specific pharmacy claim data analysis/ PBM audit work experience? If so, how much importantance or weight will be given to this specific experience? I understand you can not disclose specifics here..but can you give me an estimate? (i.e., alot, some etc...?)

A: We are looking for prior experience you have had with PBM or pharmacy claims analysis.  If you have no prior experience in this area, we are still interested in any type of data analysis you have performed involving a large number of records.  A substantial weight will be given to companies who have prior experience with PBM claims analysis.

Q: With regard to training of OIG audit staff, can we assume travel and lodging associated with the onsite training and possible onsite assistance to the OIG audit staff during the course of the OIG audit is to be included in our fixed price?

A: Yes.  Please include travel and training costs in your fixed price proposal.

The closing date for recipt of offers (proposals) IS CHANGED by this modification to earlier notices for this solicitation.  Offers are now due by 3 PM, EST, January 29, 2004, at the Contracting Office at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street, NW, Room 1342, Washington, DC.

<DESC>This notices changes the proposal due date to 29 Jun 07.  The pre-proposal conference and site visit minutes are attached along with the questions and answers from this conference.  Maintenance records for this stand and a paint report is also attached.  

This acquisition is for a firm fixed-price contract consisting of a base period for one unit. The base period will be approximately six months in length. The requirement is to repair and refurbish one empennage platform (hereinafter referred to as the tail stand) designed to service the tail components of C-5A aircraft.  The tail stand shall be brought to fully functional condition as per original design specifications.  The tail stand is a 70-ton (approximate), 70-foot tall, self-propelled lattice structure comprised of square tubing weldments.  The main structural members are four leg columns joined by bolting to structural fixed deck supports.  The structure is arranged to envelop the tail of the aircraft and provide six work levels, all connected by stairs and serviced by a 1000-pound capacity elevator.  The sixth work level provides access to the horizontal stabilizer.  Each work level consists of a fixed deck that houses a set of sliding deck panels that are manually pulled out to close the gap between the edge of the fixed deck and the vertical stabilizer.  The stand is also equipped with a 1000-pound capacity jib crane, a 1000-pound capacity traveling hoist on an I-beam, and four stabilizing jacks. The tail stand is supported by four two-wheel axles: two fixed axles are powered by a hydrostatic drive, and two steered axles are un-powered.  A 107 HP, 2800-RPM gasoline engine provides the power to drive and steer the stand at 2 mph in still air and at a slower speed against 40 mph wind. The nominal working pressure of the hydraulic system is 2000 psi.  When in position around the tail, the elevator, jib crane, and the hoist are powered through an electric cable from the hangar power source.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is looking for a source to provide a nucleic acid amplification system for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in a homogeneous, real-time detection format allowing for a one-hour assay time with high throughput capability and a simple workflow. The technology must qualitatively detect C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae DNA in endocervical swabs, male urethral swabs, and in female and male urine specimens as evidence of infection with C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, or of co-infection with both C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae. Built-in amplification controls and an option for inhibition testing must also be available with the system. The in vitro noninvasive diagnostic instrument must be FDA-approved for patient test management, and must meet the requirements for proficiency testing (PT) such as the College of American Pathologists (CAP) Surveys and Anatomic Pathology Education Programs. The storage and handling requirements for the instrument, equipment, and supplies must be stable at room temperatures. Consumables must be ready-to-go reagents. There should be minimal to no facility modifications for the instrument space requirements: bench top location preferred in only one room. Financially, the estimated value of the equipment should not exceed $50,000.00 and the estimated cost of consumables that would be required under a 5 year agreement should not exceed $25,000.00. This announcement serves as a solicitation; no other will be issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.

<DESC>Background

This is a market survey to locate potential sources for the development of a Multi-Function Aiming Device.  The United States Special Operations (USSOCOM) is attempting to improve the effectiveness of their soldiers by developing a fully integrated Multi-Function Aiming Device (MFAD) for engaging targets in close quarters combat.  

Combat operations require the soldier to accurately engage enemy personnel targets in Military Operations on Urban Terrain (MOUNT) environments at ranges of 200 meters and closer.  These close quarter battle operations may require the soldier to clear buildings with multiple rooms over extended periods of time.  Reducing the weight of ancillary equipment (e.g. lasers, lights, pistol grips, etc.) and freeing up rail space on the front hand guard of the soldier?s weapon system in order to maintain a stable and solid firing position is critical to mission success.  These factors will reduce soldier fatigue and free the weapon system of obstructions in order to accurately engage enemy personnel targets.  The MFAD shall incorporate the following components into a single, integrated system: a day sight, Infrared (IR) laser pointer, IR illuminator, visible laser pointer, and white light flashlight.

This Request for Information (RFI) is to assist the Government in determining the extent and capabilities of existing technology to meet the requirements of the MFAD.  The Government places emphasis on the proposed system?s size, light weight, and its ability to achieve the stated requirements.   The Government anticipates a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) to be published in 4Q FY07 or 1QFY08 based on the outcome of this RFI. 

The Government requests respondees provide a plan to achieve the Threshold/Objective (T/O) requirements in a concise manner which shall consist of no greater than 10 pages and be composed in Times New Roman 12 pt font.    

The Government requests that the offeror?s intended plan include a Schedule and Compliance Matrix detailing the plan?s compliance to stated specifications.  The intended plan shall also include an estimated cost which shall consist of all design, development, non-recurring engineering and production costs for 10 prototype units which shall be used for testing and operational evaluation by the user.  Additionally, respondees shall submit a proposed production plan to meet fabrication requirements from approximately 4,300 units to a total production potential of 10,000 units.

Contact JOHN PETERS if we are unable to upload the 5 reference documents.--------------------------------------------------------     We were recently tasked to open a number of offices in South-East Asia in support of the High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (HPAI) efforts, and realized that we are severely under staffed, and unprepared for this emergency response task.  In addition, due to our limited support structure, and wide geographic distribution, we have little assurance that all of the IT equipment we have in the field is ?up to date? in terms of hardware and software.  

Add to that, we were tasked to implement a re-organization which is changing the way we do administration in our field ? moving from a distributed-responsibility arrangement (where each geographic region had a ?Regional Director? ? a manager who was responsible for both program and administrative decisions) to a centralized administration (where a single Management Policy and Services office in HQ is responsible for administration and management of budget, execution and IT resources).

We are faced with a number of challenges ? some new due to the reorganization (management issues, paradigm shift, etc), and some old (security challenges, support issues due to locations and global politics).  We are trying to ensure that our field is secure, and able to communicate with both their local counterparts and officials as well as the Agency contacts here in the US.  

We have a requirement for compliance with all US and USDA laws, regulations, and policies, as well as compliance with local host country laws; and a goal of standardizing our operations so that we can provide secure, responsive service, both in programmatic and administrative efforts ? with IT equipment and infrastructure being a vital component to support the mission.

<DESC>The US Air Force is seeking information on contractor firms capable of providing advisory and assistance services (A&AS) support and capable of handling Top Secret data in support of programmatic functions in the performance of both Core Support Areas #1 and #2 described as follows.

Core Support Area #1. Firms having expertise in and able to direct efforts toward the performance of requirements in all of the following areas: 1.) Prepare strategic plans to address programmatic and budgetary management documents to ensure program success; 2) Conduct administrative tasks relevant to project management to include, but not necessarily be limited to, facilitating government project officers with coordination of acquisition requirement packages, reviewing deliverables, and tracking cost/schedule status; 3) Perform contract support assisting program lab directors in the management and operation of the governments laboratory facility; 4) Provide statistical support to program analysts and meteorologists for data trend analysis, data interpretation, report preparation, and other related functions; 5) Provide consultation services and support from recognized experts in the following disciplines: (A) nuclear engineering analysis; (B) particle transport analysis; (C) nuclear and particle physics; (D) specialized laboratory equipment design and analysis; (E) chemical engineering and related disciplines; (F) inorganic, organic, analytical, physical, and biological chemistry; (G) molecular and microbial biology; (H) virology; (I) immunology; (J) biological engineering; (K) mechanical engineering and related disciplines; and (L) aerobiological modeling and meteorological support; 6) Provide support for information technology (databases, workgroup manager duties); and 7) Provide preparation and assistance with development of field-test plans and/or integration of program assets/initiatives into outside agency field tests to include general field test support.

A firm is not required to have expertise in all of these Core Support Area #2 areas, but rather have the capability to manage a team of contractors in a business management environment that allows for the rapid acquisition of additional firms as new technologies and capabilities are identified.  The government is less interested in any team the contractor activity would respond with for purposes of this sources sought versus the overall approach a firm would utilize in managing a complex and ever changing environment and the flexibility with which new laboratories could be brought on board via the sub-contracting process.

Prospective firms are encouraged to submit a capability summary (maximum length: 10 pages) describing the firms expertise and related experiences in meeting the requirements stated above to the contract specialist:  daniel.gill@patrick.af.mil.  A top secret clearance is required.

Firms should indicate whether they are small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, HUBZone certified, or a Historically Black College or University or Minority Institution.

Respondents should include their assigned Commercial and Government Entity Code.  Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort.  Due to the nature of this potential effort, no foreign country sources will be considered.  Sources are requested to also include the Government assigned company Facility Code (also called Cage Code) for the applicable facility and stage facility that would safeguard any classified data supplied by the Government.

This is NOT a Request For Proposal (RFP), and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  No written or telephone requests for a solicitation package or further information will be accepted nor responses made. However, the Government may seek clarification by telephone.

<DESC>The Department of the Navy (DON) intends to conduct a full and open competition to select the follow-on contractor to support the Next Generation Enterprise Networks (NGEN) which includes the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) and Base Level Information Infrastructure (BLII)/ONE- Net.  Contract award is anticipated in early calendar year 2010 to allow an adequate transition period with the performance beginning 1 October 2010.  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) plans to issue a solicitation in fall 2008, but solicits industry participation and input now on several topics pertinent to the development of an overall acquisition strategy such as:  infrastructure ownership; service delivery concepts; performance management; technology infusion and adaptability; legacy applications/systems/networks; governance; business operations including ordering and invoicing; etc. Details of the issues can be found in the three briefings entitled NGEN Industry Participation (Acquisition Issues, Command and Control and New Technologies) and located herein. Input received from the briefings will be used to refine SPAWARs acquisition and contracting strategy.  The intent is to provide industry with the maximum latitude and motivation in recommending an NGEN concept and acquisition strategy which will enable continued services to the DON for the next decade. Interested potential prime contractors are encouraged to present ideas to the NGEN team by providing briefings which address the topics contained in the briefing identified above.  Each potential prime contractor will be allotted 2-4 hours for the presentation depending on the number of participation requests to which the presenter responds (maximum allotment will be 4 hours); it is suggested that at least one hour of the time be allocated for questions. Briefings should be presented via Power Point slides and may be projected if the presenter supplies its own projector.  Presentations should be substantive in content brochuremanship is strongly discouraged.   The audience will include various military and civilian Navy and Marine Corps personnel as well as DON support contractors from the following companies:  Center for Naval Analyses (CNA); BearingPoint, Booze Allen Hamilton, Falconwood and Jacobs Svedrup.  Each companys DON contracts include the appropriate organizational conflict of interest and nondisclosure agreements, but any concerns relative to participation by these companies must be raised to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) at least 2 weeks prior to the date of the presentation.  Information and comments presenters may provide may ultimately be used by the DON during the solicitation phase.  Care will be taken to protect and not divulge proprietary information.  Therefore to the extent proprietary data or information is revealed, it should be appropriately marked.  Although the opportunity to present is intended for potential prime contractors other teammates may participate at the primes discretion, but no more than 6 people may attend due to space limitations. Those potential prime contractors that want to make a presentation to the Government must contact the PCO, Debbie Streufert, at debbie.streufert@navy.mil to reserve a presentation date and time. Presentations are scheduled to begin mid-late June and last 2-4 weeks, depending on the number of respondents.

The existing BAS was deployed about 15 years ago and the operational platform was mostly based on the Microsoft DOS operating system.  Operations and maintenance is a continuing problem due to the lack of replacement parts in the commercial marketplace.  Due to the age of the current BAS system and unavailability of parts, the VA is requesting an AE firm put together a comprehensive plan to implement a new BAS platform. Construction cost range is: $500,000 to $1,000,000. Qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the following criteria: (1) Professional Qualifications: The qualifications of the individuals which will be used for these services will be examined for experience and education. The specific disciplines which will be evaluated are Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Structural, and Environmental Engineers, as well as Architects, Estimators, Specification Writers, Surveyors, and Draftsmen. (2) Capacity to Accomplish the Work: No unreasonable design deadlines are anticipated, however, the general work load and staffing capacity of the design office will be evaluated. The firm's ability to respond to the needs of the client especially in performing site investigation and in determining customer needs will also be evaluated under this category. (3) Past Performance: The past performance of the firm on hospital specific and other relevant projects for Federal Government entities including Department of Veterans Affairs - Veterans Health Administration, state and local agencies, and private business concerns will be examined (references required).  (4) Specialized Experience: Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and record of working together as a team. (5) Recovered Materials: Demonstrated success in prescribing the use of recovered materials, and using waste reduction and energy efficiency in facility design.

<CONTACT>Arlene  Dussault, (928) 328-6154
<DESC>The US Army Yuma Proving Ground (USAYPG), Yuma AZ is conducting an industry survey of interested sources for wireless networking technology to develop a portable ad-hoc wireless Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 network capable of  providing reliable, near real time communication in a desert testing environment.  The wireless system must be capable of handling (packet) voice, data, imagery and surveillance video in point-to-point, Point-to-multipoint, and multicast transmission mode s; as well as supporting tunneling Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) and Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections.  A network management package is preferably Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS), as typically used on other 802.11 compatible wireless networks.   RF backhaul requirements for this system should NOT utilize ISM frequencies.  The system will be required to support Industrial Scientific and Medical Frequencies (ISM) (2.4 and 5.8) wireless clients as well as provide 802.11 services on a licensed frequ ency.  It must be a true multi-frequency system.  RF backhaul distances (to reach the nearest fiber/Ethernet backhaul connection) may be up to 10 Km and could potentially be accomplished with directional antennas.  The system must be self-initializing, sel f-healing, un-tethered, and support nodes that may enter and leave the network at any time.  For the purpose of this document, a node is defined as any radio or physically connected collection of radio devices connected to or transmitting on the wireless n etwork.  Network nodes must be available in three different configurations, permanent fixed site, man-portable and highly mobile air/ground vehicle mounted units.  All nodes are required to be energy efficient, to operate for extended time on battery power  alone and typically on solar power for fixed site and man portable.  The system must be capable of a minimum of 10-50 nodes as in a typical multi-hopping networking configuration. It is possible that a number of these nodes may be carried by individual so ldiers, robotic vehicles, or mini-Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), so that size, weight, and power (including battery lifetimes) are critical parameters.  Any two nodes must be capable of operation as a stand alone wireless system and as a sub-network with in the overall installation infrastructure. Permanent fixed site systems may or may not be connected to a fiber network.  Fiber backhaul must connect to a standard 10/100 Ethernet connection.  Man portable nodes should be easily connected to a fiber networ k should a connection be available during a mission.  The USAYPG is interested in assessing the capabilities of this technology and its potential deployment to support natural environment and desert testing of tactical systems.  It is USAYPGs intention to eventually purchase from 3 to 4 networks consisting of 10 to 40 nodes each.  The contractor must provide installation, user training, operator manuals/applications and frequency spectrum support systems.  USAYPG requests that interested sources provide inf ormation regarding their fixed site, man-portable or highly mobile wireless network transmission equipment.  This information should include all the elements that comprise the wireless network transmission system to include brochures, pictures, and specifi cations.  Even if you can provide only a portion of the overall system, please reply with information on that portion of the project and we maybe able to suggest some partnering arrangements.  This request for information (RFI)/Sources Sought (SS) Notice i s for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the US Army USAYPG.  The purpose of this RFI/SS is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performin g the work described herein.  US Army YPG does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses, nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any informatio n submitted or for USAYPGs use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of USAYPGs review of the information received.  An original and one copy shall be sent to the US Army Yuma Provi ng Ground, Army Contracting Agency, Southern Region, Yuma Directorate, SFCA-SR-YM, 301 C Street, Building 210, Yuma AZ 85365-9498.  Technical questions may be directed to US Army Yuma Proving Ground, Advanced Technology Directorate, ATTN:  CSTE-DTC-YP-AT-D , Yuma AZ. (928) 328-7195.

<DESC>The US Army Yuma Proving Ground (USAYPG)at Yuma, AZ is conducting an industry survey of interested sources for a Range Vehicle Tracking System (RVTS).  The RVTS is intended as a supplement to existing range control safety and tracking procedures.  Th e RVTS is a real-time vehicle tracking system that will track cooperative targets.  It is not an intrusion detection system.  The RVTS may take radio traffic; gate traffic, cellular traffic and other inputs to detect the presence and location of vehicles o n or near USAYPG.  USAYPG is an area of approximately 1300 sq. miles of rugged terrain.  The external RVTS components will be exposed to USAYPG weather, and shall be able to operate in extreme weather, (129F through 20F degrees inclusive), rain, dust, stro ng wind, etc.  A cold weather version may also be required.  CAPABILITY:  When the system is fully implemented, the RVTS will display in near real-time the location of all vehicles on the USAYPG ranges.  The system will be capable of generating an alert wh en an unauthorized vehicle enters a pre-defined hazardous area.  The system may be network enabled such that it could be accessed by authorized users on the USAYPG intranet.  SPECIFICATIONS:  C.4.1-The system may be made up of gates, turnstiles, cameras, g round sensors, radios, computers, GPS, cellular technologies, or anything a vendor may find practical and useful.  Integration with existing communication equipment is encouraged.  C.4.2-The system shall be turn-key.  The vendor shall provide training and documentation, and on going technical support.  C.4.3-The system will periodically report the position of all vehicles.  This information will be used to update a database, and will provide the input to real-time displays.  C.4.4-Vehicle / personal systems  should operate on existing vehicle power or on self-contained batteries.  C.4.4.1-Track people, when these people are properly equipped.  C.4.4.2-Track ground vehicles, when going through checkpoints, or when properly equipped.  C.4.5-Systems may be activ e or passive, or a combination thereof:  C.4.5.1-An active system should alert operator if they are in restricted space.  C.4.5.2-A passive system need not automatically alert the operator if they stray into a restrictive area.  C.4.6-Systems may be situat ionally aware.  C.4.6.1-A mobile system may have some or all restricted space programmed into its memory.  C.4.6.2.-A mobile system may have programmed into its memory a temporary authorization to be in a particular restricted space.  C.4.7-The RVTS shall output data in real-time to the range control computers.  C.4.8-The vendor shall provide a computer based GUI and a software development kit (SDK). C.4.8.1-The vendor GUI shall display general YPG map overlays with vehicles represented by icons.  Different  types of vehicles could be represented by different icons.  The GUI shall have zoom in/zoom out functionality.  C.4.8.2-The RVTS shall share data with existing range control systems.  The vendor shall provide a Software Development Kit (SDK) to facilitate  follow on requirements.  C.4.9-A WEB interface is encouraged.  C.4.10-Accuracy:  Extreme accuracy is not required, however a threshold having an accuracy of 99 meters or less, 99% of the time is sufficient; and having an objective accuracy of 10 meters. C.4.11-It is recognized that Update Rate and Numbers of Players may be inversely related.  There should be no formal limit to the number of players active at one time and for planning purposes one thousand (1000) players should be used.  It is USAYPGs inte ntion to eventually purchase one system that accommodates one thousand (1000) players.  This information should include all the elements that comprise the Range Vehicle Tracking System to include brochures, pictures, and specifications.  Only offerors prov iding turn-key system need to respond.

<SUBJECT>99 -- This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.
<DESC>This notice concerns an action which may affect your company's continued business with the Federal Government and should not be disregarded.  It is in your best interest to respond to this notice.

The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following products to the P/L:
Inkjet Printer Cartridges
7510-00-NIB-0780			7510-00-NIB-0781			7510-00-NIB-0782
7510-00-NIB-0783			7510-00-NIB-0784			7510-00-NIB-0785
7510-00-NIB-0786			7510-00-NIB-0787			7510-00-NIB-0788
7510-00-NIB-0789			7510-00-NIB-0790			7510-00-NIB-0791
7510-00-NIB-0792			7510-00-NIB-0793			7510-00-NIB-0794
7510-00-NIB-0795			7510-00-NIB-0796

The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY. 
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Inkjet Printer Cartridges to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:
Canon BCI-3EPC		Canon BCI-21		Epson T044120	Epson T048220
Canon BCI-6PC		Canon BCI-24CL	Epson T044220	Epson T048320
Canon BCI-3EPM		Epson T018201	Epson T044320	Epson T048420
Canon BCI-6PM		Epson T029201	Epson T044420	Epson T048520
Canon BCI-15BK		EpsonT041020	Epson T048120	Epson T048620

In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing inkjet printer cartridges to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than June 15, 2007 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed product be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Ms. Connie Mehr at (703) 603-2116.

<SUBJECT>71 -- Sole Source Award Notice
<DESC>SOLE SOURCE NOTICE: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by 0800 EDT Wednesday 31 May 07, will be considered by the Government.  A determination not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Sole Source is based upon this vendor being the only manufacturer/vendor able to satisfy this requirement: Sole Source is also based upon the authority FAR 6.302-1(2)(C)(ii) which allows for sole source purchase if it is considered a follow-on contract for the continued development of a system when the award would result in duplication of cost.  Task Force Med is seeking brand name furniture from Herman Miller for compatibility purposes and the necessity of interfacing with the existing furniture.  The initial outfitting of the Craig Joint Theater Hospital's furniture did not adequately support the increase in mission requirements.  Currently, $550K of Herman Miller furniture is installed in the facility.  Due to the nature of the furniture, standardization is required to be moved or changed as manning fluctuates and hospital missions dictate.  This makes the compatibility of the furniture a must.  Every required piece that will be supplied by Herman Miller will match and will be able to connect without any issue.  The cost for contracting with an alternate vendor that could meet these requirements would greatly exceed the cost of this furniture contract. All interested parties wishing to view sole source justitification for this action can request a copy from SSgt Curtis Alexander. Email address: curtis.l.alexander@afghan.swa.army.mil

<SUBJECT>--Non Line of Sight-Launch System Remote Delivery System Request for Information
<DESC>This is a Request For Information (RFI) only as defined in FAR 15.201(e). THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, and contractors are not authorized to submit formal proposals. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Govern ment to form a binding contract.  This Request for Information is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make any award or to pay for any response preparation costs.  The purpose of this notice is to announce the release of the NLOS-LS (Non Line of Sight-Launch System) Remote Delivery System RFI.  The AMRDEC (Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center), on behalf of the US Army, desires to obtain information to aid in the development of a strategy for a NLOS-LS variant with multiple applications.  The US Army is interested in ascertaining the potential for developing a cost effective NLOS-LS RDS that would provide payload flexibility to multiple us ers throughout the Armed Forces. The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but desires information on interest, capability, innovative acquisition methodology and other information in planning of the acquisition of the NLOS-LS Remote Delivery System.  As a result of th is RFI, the Government expects to receive technical, programmatic, and innovative acquisition methodology data to assist in determining system solutions to the following:  (1) optimizing system design to achieve maximum flexibility for the lowest cost (2) non-traditional manufacturing strategy for military items (3) highly efficient propulsion technologies (4) safe and unique booster technologies and (4) determining performance characteristics/metrics.   A low cost, easily deployable, non-reusable delivery system is needed within the current and future forces for transporting lethal and non-lethal payloads. Due to the extensive variety of potential payload types, the basic configuration shall be versatile in design and capability allowing for maximum usability, with mission specific capabilities integrated into the payload. Key attributes include low procurement costs, integrated with NLOS-LS, and payload flexibility in a standardized package. The design ap proach should leverage both commercial and Government off-the-shelf technologies and products. The NLOS-LS Remote Delivery System will be packaged in an All Up Round (AUR) canister which is compatible with the current NLOS-LS CLU (Container Launch Unit). No classified information contained in this RFI.  No classified data shall be included in the contractor's submission.  FOREIGN PARTICIPATION IS NOT AUTHORIZED.  All proprietary material should be clearly marked. All submissions and documentation concerning this RFI shall be forwarded to Greg Haynes via e-mail gregory.haynes@us.army.mil, with a copy to Camille Jones via e-mail camille.jones@us.army.mil. Hardcopy, facsimile or video submissions are not authorized un der this announcement.  Submissions shall be limited to 20 pages (8 1/2 x 11 single-spaced), of English text, and shall be in MS Word for Windows format.  Submissions shall not be encrypted. All submissions shall be received within 30 days of issuance.

<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION:   The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Ohio requires the services of a licensed registered land surveyor for the performance of legal boundary surveys for the Wetlands Reserve Program easements in the State of Ohio.  This acquisition process is being conducted in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  THIS PROCUREMENT IS UNRESTRICTED and is therefore open to all businesses regardless of size.  The primary North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541330.  This announcement constitutes the only notice. 
 
PROJECT INFORMATION:
The government anticipates multiple awards of a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts as a result of this competition.  The initial contract period will be for one year and the government may, at its option, extend the contract to a maximum of five years by exercising each of the four one-year renewal options.  Work under the contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders.  The price of any single task order shall be at $1000 but shall not exceed $10,000.
The maximum order amount for any contract period (base year and each option year) shall be $50,000. There is no guaranteed minimum for the base period or option periods if exercised.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK   

The Surveyor will provide a Boundary Survey of the Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) Easement Area which meets the minimum technical standards for land surveying as set forth in Ohio Administrative Code A.C. Chapter 4733-37.  Projects could be anywhere in the state of Ohio.  However, the following counties currently have projects to be awarded:  Wayne (3-sites), Franklin (1-site), and Williams (1-site).  Task orders will be more specific in terms of location, acreage, survey requirements, deliverables, etc.  Work under each of these task orders will be subject to satisfactory price negotiation prior to issuance of a Notice to Proceed (NTP).  Task orders will be awarded as firm fixed price procurements.

The Contractor will provide a legal boundary survey of the WRP easement areas, including a map, a narrative easement description, and the route of ingress and egress.  Access shall be surveyed, but no monumentation is required.  The surveyor must be a licensed registered land surveyor in the state of Ohio.  The survey and descriptions shall meet all requirements of the county(s) that the land is contained in.  The survey will show both the easement boundary and the access route.  Descriptions shall be of the metes and bounds type.  The surveyor will provide (1) 8.5 in. x 11 in. copy, narrative of the Easement Description, titled Exhibit A, (2) 8.5 in. x 11 in. copy, narrative of the ingress/egress, titled Exhibit B and (3)11 in. x 17 in. Map, titled Exhibit C-1  to the Contracting Officer (CO).  

The following statement will be included on each survey:

THIS IS TO CERTIFY THAT THIS SURVEY WAS DONE BY THE UNDERSIGNED, AND THAT THE SURVEY WAS DONE ON THE GROUND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MOST RECENT MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR PROPERTY BOUNDARY SURVEYS, AS SET FORTH BY THE STATE OF OHIO.
SIGNATURE

The contractor will also include the name of the landowner and WRP contract number in the legend area of the survey plat.

Natural or manmade barriers, such as ditches, streams, creeks, bayous, or rivers are occasionally used as boundary lines in property descriptions.  In those instances, in property descriptions where boundary lines are called for as being located at or along the centerline of a ditch, stream, creek, bayou, or river for purposes of defining the Wetlands Reserve Program Easement, the surveyor shall traverse along the top bank of such ditch, stream, creek, bayou, or river.  In those cases where property descriptions call for boundary lines to be located at or along a lake, for the purposes of defining the WRP Easement, the surveyor shall traverse along the top bank of such lake or in the absence of a top bank, the surveyor shall traverse along the mean high water elevation for the lake.  Questions regarding these traverses shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

The surveyor will contact the local Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) District Conservationist (DC) prior to beginning the survey.  The DC will provide location maps of the easement area, written access, and other descriptive information as needed.  

The surveyor will provide any digital data in the format of ArcGIS shape files (.shp) NAD 83 datum in either UTM, state plane or geographic coordinates.

INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS (WHS, A&PO Aug 2006) 
a) In compliance with DFARS 252.232-7003, "Electronic Submission of Payment Request (March 2003)", Washington Headquarters Services, Acquisition & Procurement Office (WHS, A&PO) utilizes WAWF-RA to electronically process vendor request for payment.  The web based system is located at https://wawf.eb.mil, which provides the technology for government contractors and authorized Department of Defense (DOD) personnel to generate, capture and process receipt and payment-related documentation in a paperless environment.  The contractor is required to utilize this system when submitting invoices and receiving reports under this contract.  Submission of hard copy DD250/Invoice/Public Vouchers (SF1034) will no longer be accepted for payment.
 
The contractor shall (i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contract is designated in Central Contractor Registration at http://www.ccr.gov/ and (ii) register to use WAWF-RA at https://wawf.eb.mil within ten (10) days after award of the contract or modification incorporating WAWF-RA into the contract. The designated CCR EB point of contact is responsible for activating the company?s CAGE code on WAWF by calling 1-866-618-5988. Once the company CCR EB is activated, the CCR EB will self-register on the WAWF and follow the instructions for a group administrator.  Step by step instructions to register are available at http://wawf.eb.mil.  

The contractor is directed to select either ?Invoice as 2-in-1? for services only or ?Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo)? for supplies or any combination of goods and services.

Contractor shall verify that the DoDAACs automatically populated by the WAWF-RA system match the above information. If these DoDAACs do not match then the contractor shall correct the field(s) and notify the contracting officer of the discrepancy (ies).  Take special care when entering Line Item information.  The Line Item tab is where you will detail your request for payment and material/services that were provided based upon the contract. Be sure to fill in the following items exactly as they appear in the contract: 

?	Item Number: If the contract schedule has more than one ACRN listed as sub items under the applicable Contract Line Item Number (CLIN), use the 6 character, separately identified Sub Line Item Number (SLIN) (e.g. ? 0001AA) or Informational SLIN (e.g. ? 000101), otherwise use the 4 character CLIN (e.g. ? 0001).

For Supplies, enter ?SUP? followed by the last 4 digits of the invoice number. If the invoice number is less than 4 digits, enter leading zeros. Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF-RA but after submitting your document or documents, the contractor will be prompted to send additional email notifications.  Contractor shall click on ?Send More Email Notification? on the page that appears.  Add the following email address denise.v.thompson@whs.mil in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.  This additional notification to the government is important to ensure that all appropriate persons are aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF-RA system.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  
The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

SCOPE:  
 The objective of this Performance Work Statement (PWS) is to obtain all management, supervision, and personnel necessary to perform archival preservation of non-textual Federal records holdings of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Pacific Region, 1000 Commodore Dr., San Bruno, CA 94066, as specified in this Performance Work Statement (PWS).

NARA ? Pacific Region is responsible for the identification and preservation of records in archival holdings in the region.  A typical series covered by this PWS may include such nontextual records as photographic prints, negatives, and slides; and/or architectural drawings, maps, and charts; oversize records, and/or other non-textual items. 

The series concerned in the initial period are black and white photographic prints created by the Forest Service Pacific Southwest Experimental Forest and Range Experiment Station between 1896 and 1959, and processed under National Archives Record Group 95, records of the US Forest Service.  These photographs document the operations, building structures and work activity performed in the experimental forests in California.  The records are generally arranged according to the Forest Service?s alphabetic filing code and a locally devised numbering system.  A database has been constructed and some photographs have been processed.  During processing, the overall number of boxes will be expanded, and a modified, more user-friendly finding aid will be created by the Contractor.

Within the containers, the 3.5? x 5.5? photographs are stored in varying conditions.  Most items are mounted onto 5? x 8? envelopes via corner mounts, not glued down.  The envelopes bear detailed, typed captions for each photograph, and contain several duplicate copies of each print.  In their current condition, these items are stored in acidic containers, which are potentially damaging to the images over time.  The items range in size from 2 x 2? to 8 x 10.?

Records for the initial period consist of approximately 24 cubic feet of photographs stored in approximately 48 non-standard cartons measuring 5.25? x 9.75? x 14.75?.  There are approximately 12,000 photographs and images.

Records for the option periods of the contract will include preservation on similar photograph and non-textual records from RG 95, but may also include non-textual records from other Federal agencies and National Record Groups such as RG 77, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Office of Inspector General 

(OIG) is requesting proposals from contractors to perform data analysis 

and consulting services to assist OIG in auditing Pharmacy Benefit 

Managers (PBMs) which administer the mail order and retail drug 

programs to members of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program 

(FEHBP).  The contractor will review the compliance and pricing 

practices for contracts between the BlueCross BlueShield Association, a 

participating carrier in the FEHBP, and two PBMs, Medco and Advance 

PCS.  

The FEHBP was established by Public Law 86-382 and became effective on 

July 1, 1960.  It is the largest employer-sponsored group health 

insurance program in the world, covering over 9 million Federal 

employees, retirees, former employees, family members, and former 

spouses.  The Government pays up to 75% of the cost of health benefits 

coverage, and the enrollee pays the remainder, based on a formula set 

by law.  FEHBP carriers are responsible for adjudicating the claims of 

and providing health benefits to,  enrollees and covered family members 

in accordance with their contracts with OPM.

OPM has the overall responsibility for the administration of the FEHB 

Program.  This includes approving or disapproving carriers/health plans 

for participation in the FEHB Program; contracting with carriers; 

negotiating benefit and rate changes with carriers; approving the 

health plan brochures; and for publishing FEHB regulations, 

instructions, forms, and documents.  OPM is also responsible for 

receiving and depositing premium withholdings and contributions, 

remitting premiums to carriers, and accounting for the Federal 

Employees Health Benefits Fund. 

The Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducts audits of the various 

participating health plans participating in the FEHBP.  These financial 

related audits are to determine if the carriers charged costs to the 

FEHBP and provided services to FEHBP members in accordance with the 

terms of the contract.  Specifically, the OIG reviews claim payments, 

administrative expenses, and cash management activities of these 

carriers. 

BACKGROUND

OPM executed the initial contract (CS 1039) with Blue Cross Blue Shield 

Association (BCBSA) in 1960, following the passage of Public Law 

86-382.  BCBSA participates in the FEHBP as the Carrier for the Service 

Benefit Plan and offers benefits to Federal employees on a Government 

wide basis.  An administrative office, the Federal Employee Program 

Director's Office (FEPDO), was established to provide centralized 

services to the Federal Government.  

Today, BCBSA represents over 50 local BCBS plans that provide health 

benefits to about four million Federal employees, retirees and 

dependents.  The FEPDO continues to provide liaison activities to the 

Federal Government on behalf of the local BCBS plans.

The FEPDO is responsible for ensuring the Federal Government's 

instructions, requests and policies are implemented by its business 

partners, in addition to the local Plans, and for ensuring compliance 

with the Federal contract.  

In 1990, Tthe BCBSA entered into direct contract arrangements with two 

significant business partners, Merck/Medco in 1987 and Advance PCS in 

1993, to provide a mail order drug program and a retail pharmacy 

program, respectively.  For contract year 2002, these two PBMs were 

paid approximately $36 billion for benefits to rom the Federal 

Government for their services through their BlueCross BlueShield 

subscribers in the FEHBP.contracts.

OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF WORK

The OIG seeks a contractor with specific expertise in the PBM and 

pharmacy benefits contracting areas to assist OIG in auditing PBMs. The 

objectives of the contract are to: 
(1) determine whether Medco and PCS paid pharmacy claims accurately and 

in accordance with the contract for years 2000 through 2002, (2) 

identify unusually high utilization of a particular drug by a pharmacy, 

physician, or member, (3) identify the 50 highest utilized drugs 

dispensed to FEHBP subscribers, (4) identify potential fraudulent 

claims, (5) identify ways to improve the contracts, and (6) assist OIG 

personnel in using the software analysis to audit the PBMs. The OIG 

plans on performing audits of these two PBMs using the data analysis 

provided by the contractor/consultant.  The contractor is required to 

review 100 percent of the claims provided.  The contractor is also 

required to provide a separate analysis for each of the PBMs.  

In order to achieve the objectives, the OIG believes that the 

contractor's data analysis should allow the OIG audit staff to:

the correct discount and administrative fees were applied.
* Verify that correct dispensing fees were applied.
* Verify the amount due from rebate programs.
* Verify the amount of savings from generic drug substitution.
* Identify any input errors.

B. Identify any unusual trends or patterns when comparing the three 

years of data.

C. Identify prescription splitting.

D. Match drug therapy to medical diagnosis.

E. Analyze the controls in place to manage these drug programs.

F. IdentifyIdentify phantom and/or kited claims.

STATEMENT OF WORK

Title of Project: HIV/AIDS Faith-based Forum Project


I.   Background and Need  
It has been more than 25 years since the first U.S. diagnosed case of AIDS.  Although efforts have been made to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS in the U.S., Americans continue to be affected by increasing HIV/AIDS prevalence rates.   The African American community  more than any other racial or ethnic group - has been severely impacted by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  Even though African Americans comprise only 13 percent of the U.S. population, they accounted for half of the new HIV/AIDS cases diagnosed (in 33 states) and more than half of the people who have died from AIDS.

Over the last year The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has conducted a host of activities as a part of our heightened response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in African American communities.  The Division of HIV /AIDS (DHAP) seeks to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS by tapping the expertise of various sectors, including the faith community and its leadership, to mobilize broader community action; increase opportunities for diagnosing and testing HIV; improve program services; and prevent HIV infections through effective interventions.  The CDC has long recognized the essential role that the faith community plays in influencing knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors relating to health. As a result of a faith-based consultation completed by DHAP in 2006, CDC found that faith leaders expressed a strong desire for education to help them address HIV/AIDS effectively so that they may play an important role in efforts to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community.

The HIV/AIDS Faith-based Forum Project is a vehicle through which, faith leaders from African American faith denominations shall acquire and develop the skills to better raise awareness about the impact of HIV/AIDS on African Americans, and to develop ways to inform and inspire their peers and congregants to increase HIV prevention.

	Increase the ability of faith leaders to promote HIV prevention awareness within their congregations and communities.

The HIV/AIDS faith-based forum(s) shall allow participants to engage in panel discussions about ways to break the silence about HIV/AIDS, challenge stigma, and promote HIV testing and diagnosis in African American churches as a means of reducing HIV/AIDS in African American communities.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-16.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334519 with a small business size standard of 500.

The acquisition is being procured using full and open competition.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for one (1) Half Body Radioactive Contamination Personnel Monitor. The monitor is intended for clearance monitoring for beta surface contamination on personnel leaving laboratories. 

LINE ITEM 0001:  Quantity 1 each Half Body Radioactive Contamination Personnel Monitor, meeting or exceeding the following required minimum specifications:

1. The Personnel Contamination Monitor (PCM) shall automatically detect the presence of beta emitting contamination on clothes or exposed skin of the person while standing in the unit. The PCM shall alarm and notify the user if the contamination exceeds specified levels; 

2. The unit shall be capable of fully monitoring the head, hands, feet, legs, arms, and trunk of an individual for surface contamination in no more than a two step process (front and back or side and side). The PCM shall use a full coverage contour that assures monitoring of the palm and back of the hands, top, bottom, and sides of shoes, face and head, arms, legs, and torso so as to optimize detector geometric efficiency. The total coverage area shall not be less than 8000 squared centimeters;

3. The PCM shall automatically sense the presence of the user and start the counting sequence. These sensors shall assure the user is positioned close enough to the detectors to optimize detection geometry. Manual buttons or switches that must be pushed by the user will not satisfy these requirements;
 
4. The PCM shall use audible and visual indicators notifying the user of the count sequence status;
 
5. The response to the RFQ shall include provisions for an optional frisking probe with alarming capabilities for checking tools, equipment, wheels on carts, and other items. Cable lengths must satisfy these tasks;

6. The frisking probe shall provide some means (audible or visual) to gauge the response while the user can not directly view the main display on the monitor unit;

7. The monitor shall have both audible and visual indication of an alarm and location of the detector originating the alarm. The display must be readable by the user. This may be accomplished either by maintaining the displayed results long enough for the user to review them after leaving the monitoring position or by placing the display where it can be seen during use. The PCM shall also allow for an optional automatic hard copy printout when the count indicates contamination;

8. The monitor shall include connections to allow remote alarm notifications. The PCM also shall be capable of communicating system status, alarm conditions, or other parameters to a remote computer via secure LAN twisted pair or TCP/IP connections;

9. The monitor shall include provisions for a printout (ie: a printer port) or easily readable computer file documenting alarm conditions and usage history that NIST Health Physics staff may review either upon response to an alarm or during normal daily rounds. The printer shall be supplied with the unit;

10. The monitor shall be PC based to allow easy upgrade of the program and supporting files (such as audio WAV files, onscreen instructions etc) as needed;

11. The computer and all detector electronics shall be enclosed and mounted inside the cabinet so that there are minimal outside cables and connections except what is required for printers and IO devices;

12. The computerized controlling program shall incorporate automated routines for performing instrument set-up and quality assurance.  These routines shall include automated high voltage plateaus, discriminator threshold and window settings, background and efficiency trending for each detector.  The system shall be able to produce data file reports and hard copy printouts to document QA testing and trends;

13. Setup, QA, and diagnostics program interface shall be onscreen menu driven so that it can be followed by a technician without substantial reference to the hard copy tech manual;

14. The PCM algorithm shall incorporate a means for a single individual to perform all QA source response and alarm checks.  It shall not be required for a single technician to hold the source close to each detector and simultaneously operate an IO device or position sensor;

15. The controlling algorithm shall include alarm point settings, calibration efficiencies, and readout units that may be adjusted by NIST Health Physics staff;

16. The algorithm shall include maximum count time settings and minimum sensitivities (MDA) that are selectable by NIST Health Physic staff.  The system manager (NIST HP) shall have the option to select a fixed count time with a varying sensitivity (down to some specified limit) based depending on variable background or using a fixed sensitivity with a varying count time (up to a maximum time) based on the variable back ground;

17. The programs shall allow for diagnostic and setup utilities including individual detector ?real time? rate meters, individual detector background history trend graphs, individual detector HV plateaus and threshold setup utilities, individual detector efficiencies, and individual and grouped alarm point settings;

18. The algorithm shall include an automatic background update to correct the active count.  This shall be based on a rolling average with times that shall be adjustable by the NIST HP staff;

19. The PCM shall temporarily suspend operations going ?Out of Service? and notify users on screen if a step change in background or other fault condition such as a low ?failed detector? count rate or a high ?contaminated detector? count rate occurs that prevents the unit from reliably alarming for the specified levels of sensitivity.  The unit shall return to service when background or fault conditions return to normal;

20. The algorithm shall allow a means to compensate for ?self shielding? of the background when a user steps into or approaches the unit;

21. The PCM shall include provisions for the user to save the background, usage, and QA and maintenance history to a computer file or print out while the monitor remains available for normal contamination monitoring.  The algorithm shall include a mode to automatically and periodically transmit this data to an external PC, a computer disk, or a printer unless the system stores the data internally in an easily retrievable, readable, and transferable manner;

22. The monitor shall automatically reset to the user specified parameters and return to service following any power interruptions;

23. The monitor shall be designed to minimize operating and maintenance requirements.  To meet this requirement sealed proportional detectors are preferred over flow through units. Solid state detectors will be considered if it can be demonstrated that they meet the same alpha/beta detection capabilities and are not overwhelmed by external background fluctuations;

24. The system shall be delivered with all components or accessories necessary for data input/output and programming control including but not limited to computer, keyboard, mouse or track ball, monitor, printer, plugs, and cables;

25. The system IO connections shall be arranged for easy access.  The ports should be located on the front or sides of the instrument so as not to be blocked by placement of the PCM close to walls;

26. The monitor components shall be designed for easy access for decontamination and repair.  All decontaminations, repairs, or component replacements shall be possible without the use of specialized tools (unless provided with the equipment), relocation of the PCM unit, or substantial technical support from the manufacturer.  Where possible all detectors and supporting electronics shall be of similar design so as to be fully interchangeable.  It shall be possible to take some detectors out of service without fully disabling the PCM;

27. With the exception of the detector windows, the unit shall be able to be cleaned with standard cleaning supplies and equipment;
 
28. The PCM shall have a maximum foot print of 54 inch x 52 inch and maximum height of 92 inch. It shall be possible to transfer the unit through 6 ft 10 inch high x 47 inch wide doorways.  This should be able to be accomplished by tipping the unit on its side or back and turning it through the door or by some minimally disruptive disassembly;

29. The unit shall operate on standard 115 to 125 Volt 15 amp 60 Hz ac power.  The unit shall be delivered with appropriate surge suppression/uninterruptible power supply to minimize the impact of power surges or disruptions;

Detector Characteristics:

30. The unit shall have at least fifteen zones or separate detectors so that the location of detected contamination is indicated.  The algorithm shall also provide a sum zone or distributed contamination detection capability;

31. Each detector zone shall cover at least 250 squared centimeters for each location and allow for an open area of at least 58 percent where transmission is not impeded by grids or supports.  The mesh on the grid must be tight enough to prevent the detectors from being ruptured by small objects such as a dropped pen. Separate detectors are required for each monitored area;

32. The PCM algorithm shall incorporate sum zone logic to combine response of adjacent detectors to alarm for low levels of generally distributed contamination.  User selectable confidence levels shall be part of the combining algorithm;

33. The PCM shall be capable of detecting contamination of S-35 with maximum beta energy of 0.167 MeV. Other contamination isotopes to be detected include C-14, Sr-90, P-32, U-238, I-125, I-131.  The monitor shall have a minimum efficiency of 10 percent for a point source of Co-60;

34. The PCM shall be capable of alarming for performance testing with 0.01 uCi of Sr/Y-90 and 0.1 uCi of Cs-137 within a reasonable counting time (less than 30 seconds) while operating in a variable external gamma background condition up to 2 mrem/hr (range 0.005 to 2 mrem/hr.);

35. The PCM shall be able to detect 5000 DPM/100 squared centimeters of Cs-137 at one inch from a detector with a 90 percent probability of detection and a 0.1 percent false alarm rate with a maximum count time of 15 seconds while operating in a 20 uR/hr background field; 

36. The contractor shall provide support personnel to train NIST HP staff during the set-up, initial calibrations, and initial usage of the monitor on-site at NIST;

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-16.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 333314 and the small business size is 500.

The acquisition is being procured using full and open competition.  

This is a brand name or equal requirement.  Brand name or equal description is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive and is to indicate the quality and characteristic of products that will be considered satisfactory to meet the agency?s requirement. 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology has a requirement for one Olympus MVX10 Macroview Microscope System and components. This microscope will have two primary functions: assist in device fabrication and monitor microfluidic device performance. Due to space limitations, it is important that the microscope be able to do both.

For device fabrication, this requires the use of a stereomicroscope for proper alignment, a long working distance objective to allow manipulation of bulky substrates, and clearance for the insertion of tubing, electrical wiring, and additional optical components.

To monitor device operation, both stereo and macro modes are required. In both cases, the working distance must be sufficient to allow access to the aforementioned tubing, wiring, and additional optical components. Stereo will allow us to ensure the mechanical features of the device (microvalves) are operating properly and the fluids moving along the proper flow paths. We will also track solid objects (1-100 um) without fluorescence in the device both visually and w/ a CCD camera. The macro mode is required for image acquisition for quantitative analysis. Since it is often difficult to illuminate the flow paths, a system is needed that utilizes a single optical path to accommodate the relatively low light. During an experiment time is a factor, so it is important that the switching between modes be fast and require little to no adjustment/focusing.

LINE ITEM 0001:  Quantity one each Olympus MVX10 Macroview Microscope system or equivalent, including the following Olympus Part Numbers: (1) MVX-ZB10; (2) MVX-X011; (3) MVX-200; (4) 3-MVX100; (5) 1-MVX100, DI-TLB3018, and (6) 2-U100H3, meeting all of the following required salient characteristics:

1.	The  light path must be switchable between macro and stereo modes, and must beintegrated into a single body;  

2.   The body must be of single optical axis design (macro) to double the numerical aperture for increased resolution and light sensitivity;
	
3. The main objective must be a planapochromat 1x for viewing field flatness;

4. The base must be transmitted light via Gimbal mirror system with fiber optic light source to minimize heat transfer to the baseavoid heating the base greater than 1-2 degrees C;
	
5.  The scope must have a working distance of 65 mm or greater with a 1x objective;


6. The head must be binocular/trinocular to allow image recording through standard c-mount connectors;
	
7. The body must have an integrated iris diaphragm to control depth of field;

8. The two-position nosepiece and optics must retain parfocality when switching.

Delivery shall be completed in accordance with the contractor?s commercial schedule.

Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination.  FOB Destination means the contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. 
 
Award shall be made to the party whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical capability and price will be considered.  The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor ?Meeting or exceeding the Requirement,?, and 2) Price. Technical Capability and Price are of equal importance.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-16.

This is an "open-market" solicitation.  GSA Vendors are encouraged to provide a quotation in response to this solicitation.  However, the Government's terms and conditions identified herein take precedence.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  However, this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.

To support the development of standards for trace explosive detection, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Trace Explosives Analyzer to be used in the Surface and Microanalysis Science Division, Analytical Microscopy Group, at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, to analyze and quantify trace amounts of explosive compounds.

The mission of NIST, as mandated by Congress, is to develop and promote measurements, standards, and technology to enhance productivity, facilitate trade, and improve the quality of life.  Reliable standards are needed to test the performance and effectiveness of trace explosive detectors, which protect the public and infrastructure of the U.S.  Currently, NIST has an active program in trace detection metrology using state-of-the-art microanalytical instrumentation, ion mobility spectrometers, and inkjet printers for the development of trace explosive reference materials. This program is designed to meet the measurement quality needs of organizations and agencies that use trace explosive detectors. A critical requirement for NIST is to validate the quantities of trace explosives on samples such as test swipes and reference materials. For this purpose, NIST has several systems in place, but these systems lack the sensitivity and precision needed for validating deposits of trace explosives at picogram levels.  Gas chromatography with electron capture detection is a potentially acceptable technology, although other systems may be acceptable as well. 

All interested Contractor?s shall provide a quote for the following line items(s):

Line Item 0001:  The contractor shall furnish one (1) each, trace explosives analyzer.

The analyzer shall meet or exceed the following minimum technical specifications:

1.	The system must be able to analyze microliter-sized liquids for trace explosives.
2.	It is recommended that the proposed detection system not be based on mass spectrometry, since these detectors are currently well represented in our laboratory and cannot meet the reproducibility requirement.
3.	The following analytes must be separable and detectable below 10 picograms in mass, and below 10 micrograms per liter in acetonitrile: cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine (RDX), pentaerythritol-tetranitrate (PETN), and trinitrotoluene (TNT).  Please note other specific analytes and performance criteria under ?Stronger Considerations? below.
4.	For all required analytes, reproducibility of signals (relative standard deviation of the mean) at the 10 picogram level must be better than 2 percent.
5.	Documentation must be provided regarding system sensitivity (limits of detection, SEE NOTE 1) and analytical precision to the analytes named above.  This documentation may be either in commercial specification sheets or test reports. The purpose is to establish the sensitivity limits that will be used during acceptance tests (described below).
6.	The system must be operable through MS Windows-compatible software to display, analyze, and record data.

NOTE 1:  The limit of detection (LOD) is commonly accepted as the smallest amount of a particular substance that can be reliably detected in a given type of medium by a specific measurement process. The analytical signal from this amount must be high enough above background variations to give statistical confidence that the signal is real, so the LOD is normally defined as the amount of substance that generates an average signal three times higher than the standard deviation of the background signal or analytical signal at LOD levels, whichever is greater. 

Installation/Training/Warranty:

1.	The contractor shall schedule and facilitate installation/set-up.  Installation, at a minimum, shall include uncrating/unpackaging of all equipment, set-up and hook-up of the instrument, demonstration of all required specifications, and removal of trash. Onsite installation and demonstration shall be done at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.

2.	The contractor shall schedule and facilitate one (1) eight hour training session for up to five (5) technicians at NIST.  The training shall provide a thorough demonstration of all equipment functions, maintenance, data administration, and basic troubleshooting.  The training may be completed at NIST immediately after installation and demonstration of performance specifications, but no later than 30 days after installation.  The contractor shall provide a list of installation requirements, including house services and furniture, with explanations, as soon as the contract is awarded.  NIST will provide any required connections to house services.
3.	Quotation must include unlimited telephone/e-mail support during business hours, Monday through Friday, during the warranty period, for questions regarding operation, and a one-year warranty.  This warranty must cover non-consumable parts and travel/labor on-site should this become necessary within the warranty period.

Inspection and Acceptance Criteria:

1.	Visual-Physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to design specifications.
    a. The system is operable through MS Windows-compatible software to display, analyze, and record data.
2.	Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications.
    a.  Using standard materials supplied by NIST, the system will be required to detect any of the required analytes (deposited as solutions onto the primary collection grid) at twice the LOD or LOD90 as specified by the supplier. This level for each analyte will be the ?detector challenge? (DC)(SEE NOTE 2).   
    b.  The tests will be performed by NIST as soon as the instrument is ready, as determined by the contractor, and will be witnessed by the contractor. The instrument must accurately identify each analyte. Upon any failure, the test for that analyte will be repeated five times. Accurate detection must occur in at least four (4) of those five analyses. 

NOTE 2: The Detector Challenge (DC), where the false negative rate should be negligible, is arbitrarily defined as the amount of substance that should generate a signal twice the DL90, so that, DC = 2 LOD90.

Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the contractor?s commercial schedule.

FOB Destination means:  The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.

EPAs will be calculated and processed quarterly, with the prevailing fuel index at the end of the quarter being used to calculate the index at the beginning of the subject quarter. The calculation could result in increases or decreases in the price adjustment for fuel.     OPM will compensate the contractor for any calculated increases in fuel costs and the contractor would either, at OPMs discretion, pay OPM or issue a credit to OPM for any decreases in fuel costs. The Contracting Officer will make the final determination of which method of consideration the contractor will provide OPM for decreased fuel adjustments.

 (b)  It is the contractor's duty to protect National Security Information, Restricted Data, and Formerly Restricted Data.  The contractor shall, in accordance with the Commission's security regulations and requirements, be responsible for protecting National Security Information, Restricted Data, and Formerly Restricted Data, and for protecting against sabotage, espionage, loss, and theft, the classified documents and material in the contractor's possession in connection with the performance of work under this contract.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this contract, the contractor shall, upon completion or termination of this contract, transmit to the Commission any classified matter in the possession of the contractor or any person under the contractor's control in connection with performance of this contract.  If retention by the contractor of any classified matter is required after the completion or termination of the contract and the retention is approved by the contracting officer, the contractor shall complete a certificate of possession to be furnished to the Commission specifying the classified matter to be retained.  The certification must identify the items and types or categories of matter retained, the conditions governing the retention of the matter and their period of retention, if known.  If the retention is approved by the contracting officer, the security provisions of the contract continue to be applicable to the matter retained.
 
 (c)  In connection with the performance of the work under this contract, the contractor may be furnished, or may develop or acquire, safeguards information, or confidential or privileged technical, business, or financial information, including Commission plans, policies, reports, financial plans,  internal data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub.

The contractor shall ensure that information protected from public disclosure is maintained as required by NRC regulations and policies, as cited in this contract or as otherwise provided by the NRC.  The contractor will not directly or indirectly duplicate, disseminate, or disclose the information in whole or in part to any other person or organization except as may be necessary to perform the work under this contract.

Such employee will not be authorized to work under any NRC contract without the approval of SB/DFS.  Timely receipt of properly completed security applications is a contract requirement.  Failure of the contractor to comply with this condition within the ten work.day period may be a basis to void the notice of selection.  In that event, the Government may select another firm for award.  When an individual receives final access, the individual will be subject to a reinvestigation every 10 years.
 
The contractor shall submit a completed security forms packet, including the SF-86, "Questionnaire for National Security Positions," and fingerprint charts, through the Project Officer to the NRC SB/DFS for review and favorable adjudication, prior to the individual performing work under this contract.  The contractor shall assure that all forms are accurate, complete, and legible (except for Part 2 of the questionnaire, which is required to be completed in private and submitted by the individual to the contractor in a sealed envelope), as set forth in MD 12.3.

       (b)       Key Personnel

              (1)       In order to ensure a smooth and orderly start up of work, it is essential that the key personnel specified in the Contractor's proposal be available on the effective date of the contract. If these personnel are not made available at that time, the Contractor must notify the Government Contracting Officer and show cause. If the Contractor does not show cause, the Contractor may be subject to default action.
              (2)       The Contractor shall not of its own will remove or replace any personnel designated as "key" personnel without the written concurrence of the cognizant Contracting Officer.

This notification must be no later than five (5) calendar days in advance of any proposed substitution and must include justification (including resume(s) of proposed substitution(s)) in sufficient detail to permit evaluation of the impact on contract performance.
              (3)       Substitute personnel qualifications must be equal to, or greater than, those of the personnel being substituted. If the Government Contracting Officer and the COR determine that the proposed substitute personnel is unacceptable, or that the reduction of effort would be so substantial as to impair the successful performance of the work under the contract, the Contractor may be subject to default action.     If deemed necessary by the Government, substitute personnel must be given a one-(1) day orientation by Contractor personnel at no additional cost to the Government and with no change in the delivery schedule.
              (4)       In the event that the performance of assigned Contractor personnel or any substitute(s) is determined by the Government to be unsatisfactory at any time during the life of the Contract, the Government reserves the right to request and receive satisfactory personnel replacement within five (5) calendar days of receipt by the Contractor of written notification. 
Notification will include the reason for requesting replacement personnel.
              (5)       The Contractor-supplied personnel are employees of the Contractor and under the administrative control and supervision of the Contractor. The Contractor, through its personnel, shall perform the tasks prescribed herein. The Contractor must select, supervise, and exercise control and direction over its employees (including subcontractors) under this Contract. The Government shall not exercise any supervision or control over the Contractor in its performance of contractual services under this contract. The Contractor is accountable to the Government for the action of its personnel.
              (6)       The Contractor is herewith notified that employee recruiting and employee retention practices shall be monitored on a regular basis.

       (c)       Qualifications of Employees

       The Contracting Officer may require dismissal from work of those employees which he/she deems incompetent, careless, insubordinate, unsuitable or otherwise objectionable, or whose continued employment he/she deems contrary to the public interest or inconsistent with the best interest of national security. The Contractor must fill out, and cause each of its employees on the contract work to fill out, for submission to the Government, such forms as may be necessary for security or other reasons. Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor's employees must be fingerprinted. Each employee of the Contractor who works on this contract shall be a citizen of the United States of America, or an alien who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence as evidenced by Alien Registration Receipt Card Form 1-151, or who presents other evidence from the Immigration and Naturalization Service that employment will not affect his/her immigration status.

       (d)       Standards of Conduct

       Personnel assigned by the contractor to the performance of work under this order must be acceptable to the Government in terms of personal and professional conduct.     Contractor personnel shall conform to standards of conduct as follows:

       (1)       No contractor employees shall solicit new business while performing work under this order.

       (2)       The contractor and its employees shall not discuss with unauthorized persons any information obtained in the performance of work under this order.

       Should the continued assignment to work under this order of any person in the contractor?s organization be deemed by the Contracting Officer to conflict with the interests of the Government, that person shall be removed immediately from assignment, and the reason for removal shall be fully documented in writing by the Contracting Officer.     Employment and staffing difficulties shall not be justification for failure to meet established schedules, and if such difficulties impair performance, the contractor may be subject to default.

       (e)       Contractor Report of Separated Staff

       The contractor shall notify the Government by the fifth day of each month, for the prior 60 day period, of any staff with access to the Office of Personnel Management?s information systems that for any reason (separation, reassignment, etc.) are no longer performing services under the contract. This also applies to new employees. Such notification shall take place using the attached form and shall be sent to the Contracting Officer?s Representative, contract administrator and systemaccesscontrol@opm.gov on a monthly basis.     Negative reports (no change in contractor staff) are required.     Failure to submit this monthly report will result in the suspensions of all User IDs associated with this contract.

       (a)       The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractor?s knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest (OCI), as defined in FAR 9.5, Organizational and Consultants Conflicts of Interest, or that the Contractor has disclosed all such relevant information.

       (b)       The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential OCI is discovered after award, the Contractor shall make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure must include a description of actions, which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict.

       (c)       The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an OCI. If the Contractor was aware of a potential OCI prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contacting Office, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.

       (d)       The Contractor must include this clause in all subcontracts and in lower tier subcontracts unless a waiver is requested from, and granted by, the Contracting Officer.

       (e)       In the event that a requirement changes in such a way as to create a potential conflict of interest for the Contractor, the Contractor must: 
       (1)       Notify the Contracting Officer of a potential conflict, and;
       (2)       Recommend to the Government an alternate approach which would avoid the potential conflict, or
              (3)       Present for approval a conflict of interest mitigation plan that will:
                     (i)       Describe in detail the changed requirement that creates the potential conflict of interest; and
                     (ii)       Outline in detail the actions to be taken by the Contractor or the Government in the performance of the task to mitigate the conflict, division of subcontractor effort, and limited access to information, or other acceptable means.
       (4)       The Contractor must not commence work on a changed requirement related to a potential conflict of interest until specifically notified by the Contracting Officer to proceed.
       (5)       If the Contracting Officer determines that it is in the best interest of the Government to proceed with work, notwithstanding a conflict of interest, a request for waiver must be submitted in accordance with FAR 9.503.

A user guide that explains how to use eSRS is available at: http://esrs.gov/documents/esrs_contractor_user_guide_1.7.pdf.     If you notice that your company contact information or DUNS number in eSRS are not correct, then please make corrections through the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) website at http://www.ccr.gov/.     That data will then flow from the CCR to the Federal Procurement Data System ? Next Generation (FPDS-NG) and then finally into the eSRS system.     Repopulation of your eSRS contact info can take two business days after you make corrections in the CCR.     Please include the e-mail addresses of the contracting officer in eSRS for notification in block 13 of the report.

              (2)       Starting with fiscal year 2004, submit your Summary Subcontracting Reports (SSRs ? Old SF 295) and your Individual Subcontracting Reports (ISRs ? Old SF 294) for contracts into the eSRS. Midyear reports are not required in eSRS for FY 2004 and 2005.

              (3)       For fiscal year 2006 onward also submit your midyear (March) ISRs into eSRS.

              (4)       If you have not yet submitted a final report for any contracts closed during FY 2004 onward, you should do so now using the eSRS.

              (5)       Please continue to submit to the Contracting Officer paper prints of all the reports you input to eSRS, until further notice. (This continues to be a FAR requirement) 

              (6)       If you have a Contract (BPA) with OPM, please submit your ISRs via paper. FPDS-NG, which provides data into eSRS, does not identify subcontracting plans resulting from BPAs and other types of orders.

<SUBJECT>66--DIGITAL RADIOGRAPHIC X-RAY SYSTEM
<SOLNBR>W9124R-07-T-1037
<RESPDATE>052407
<ARCHDATE>07232007
<CONTACT>Samuel Colton, 928-328-6354
<DESC>See attached questions submitted and answes. Q1. Line Item (CLIN) 0001 References a Brand Name GE Inspection Technologies CR100E or Equal, however this is actually a Model ACR-2000/ACR200i manufactured by Eastman Kodaks Lumisys Division.   The specification reads as follows Portable Phosphor Scanne r-Flash X-Ray System.  What is meant by this as it cannot be both a scanner and a flash x-ray system? A1. As far as the CR100E, we have supporting evidence that the Dept. of Energy and some of the other proving grounds are currently utilizing this equipment in the same manner as we do (utilizing the same Flash X-ray equipment in the same operating ranges) that we utilize here at YPG.  In response to the scanner, this will serve as the device which will process the image from the phosphor storage plate (screen) into the computer, where the software will be responsible for enhancement, file identification and  copying to media for the customer.  The scanner is NOT an X-ray producing product, but rather an image retrieval, processor and file identifier with copy capabilities to media. Q2. It further states that it is to operate in the 450kV  1Mev range at 10  15mR.  This is a typical specification for an x-ray source, the CR100E does not produce any x-rays, and it is only a laser reader for the image storage screens.  Is the end user certain the CR100E produces x-rays emissions in the range stated?  A2. The CR100 is not an X-ray producing system.  We have the Flash X-ray producing equipment already.  The only requirement to effectively use the CR100 is to supply a phosphor storage imaging plate that is sensitive enough to produce fine quality images i n the 450kV-1MeV range with output from the X-ray unit producing 10-15mR. Q3. The specification refers to Phosphor storage screens rated for use with Flash X-Ray Systems only.  Eastman Kodak is the ONLY current manufacturer of the 14 x 51 and 14 x 60 storage screens.  To our knowledge Kodak does not produce or reference any screen that is specifically used only for flash x-ray.  The Kodak, Fuji and other image storage screens utilized in compute radiography (CR) respond to all types of x-radiation, including gamma sources, i.e., Iridium and Cobalt.  Is this statement or requi rement based sales information from GE or is there a specific screen specification to support this requirement?   If so we would appreciate documentation to this effect. A3. No sales information was utilized to come to this conclusion, but through use and knowledge of the operating ranges and materials needed to meet our needs.  We are currently utilizing phosphor storage screens with film in our daily Flash X-ray operatio ns.  The difference here with digital is that the film will no longer be utilized and as a result, the phosphor storage imaging plates must be more sensitive to the Flash X-ray systems in answer #2 in order to compensate for the loss of the film.    Q4. Is the specification actually stating that the digital radiographic flash x-ray system, that is reader, workstation, computer, monitors, etc.,  must be able to withstand a blast overpressure from an explosive device of 75,000 psi?  If so, what about th e technician? A4. As for the ruggedness of the operating system, the equipment will be housed (as well as the technician) in a safe environment, but the phosphor storage plate will be housed in a rigid cassette near the ballistic event.  At times the cassette will actua lly be blown away from its placement point near the weapon, so the storage plate must be able to withstand this type of environment.  In addition, the area where the operating system is housed is subject to concussion inside of the van or the building, and  could be an issue during operation.   Q5. Are these systems required to be explosive proof? A5. Computer systems do not have to be explosive proof Q6.  Is the specification stating that if the imaging acquisition/enhancement software certifies  to DICOM that it is not DICONDE compliant?  If so please provide supporting evidence, not manufacturers sales literature/specifications. A6. The DICOM/DICONDE compliancy, the software MUST be in Non Destructive Testing format with supporting paperwork that they are compliant per ASNT specifications and must provide this documentation PRIOR to awarding the contract.  It is understood that DI COM/DICONDE is evolving, but enough information and time has been provided by ASNT to allow the vendor to have this process well under way.  I realize it is a long process, but the issue of proprietary software is NOT acceptable due to the problem with sha ring our images with our customers without additional cost.  Q7. The question that I have is on the fifth item listed in the monitor specification.  The request for 5 USB 2.0 High Speed Ports is unusual in that I cannot find a monitor that has that on it.  The workstation has 5 USB 2.0 in the back of the station and  two on the front, in addition, the monitors that are supplied by Dell and others have two USBs available.  The specification that you have sent out appears to be for a Dell system as the nomenclature matches exactly with their website information, but no ne of the monitor options that Dell has have 5 USB ports available, just 2.  I was just wondering if a workstation specification got miss placed on the monitor.   A7.  The USB port issue has been reviewed and is has been determined that 2 ports will be sufficient.
