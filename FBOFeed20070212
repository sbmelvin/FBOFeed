A.	INTRODUCTION: 

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy Directorate(DE) located at Kirtland AFB NM is interested in receiving proposals in the five technical areas under Light Innovation Technologies (LITE). The total program budget for these efforts is $24M over 60 months. The projected start date will be during the third quarter of FY07. 

Proposals are due by 12:00 p.m. Mountain Standard Time, 27 March 2007.  PLEASE REALIZE THIS FUNDING PROFILE IS AN ESTIMATE ONLY, IS NOT A PROMISE FOR FUNDING, AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE DUE TO GOVERNMENT DISCRETION AND AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS. AFRL will not issue a separate solicitation. AFRL is distributing this BAA electronically through FedBizOpps at http://www.fbo.gov. Once there, offerors should enter BAA 07-DE-02 into the search option to reach the posting. 

B.	REQUIREMENT DESCRIPTION/TOPIC AREAS:

Topic Area 1: Real-time Optical Surveillance Applications (ROSA)

	Technical point-of-contact:  Ms. Laura Ulibarri, AFRL/DESM 808-891-7737

	Technical solutions should address development of robust and pioneering algorithms and software tools that will process significant amounts of real-time Electro-Optic (EO) Space Situational Awareness (SSA) data and produce real-time, high-accuracy change detection information in very low light conditions, as well as software to integrate tasking and data integration from networks of EO sensors with disparate capabilities: wavelength coverage, imaging resolution, phenomenology, platform, etc. The next generation of EO SSA sensors must handle complex tasking and operations, and will require a minimal amount of human in the loop to ensure the correct objects were being tracked and the correct information was collected. Technologies developed will include intelligent agent autonomous algorithms, databasing, novel search techniques, and real-time processing software for anomaly detection and cueing of active (laser) and passive EO systems. Estimated funding is $10,000,000.

(In this area the Government contemplates an Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (ID/IQ) CPFF contract vehicle with an ordering period of 5 years. Offerors shall provide a technical proposal for the basic ID/IQ contract, and a cost and technical proposal for proposed initial Task Order plus an additional task order representative of the overarching Contractor Statement of Work for the basic contract. The initial Task Order should focus on development and demonstration of an initial proof of concept that provides a small scale demonstration of the capabilities for integrated tasking and fusion of networked EO sensors. It should be emphasized that we are looking for innovative solutions in this area that will provide the technical basis for enhanced Space Situational Awareness solutions. This effort should be completed within a year and within a budget of approximately $1.2M.  Offerors should contact the technical point of contact designated above for additional information regarding the focus of the first task order.) 

Topic Area 2: Adaptive Optics Improvements

	Technical POC LtCol Scott Hunt, 808-874-1513  and Dr Earl Spillar (DSN 246-6740, comm 505-846-6740)

	The Air Force Research Laboratories Optics Division would like to improve the reliability, maintainability, and performance of its existing adaptive optics systems for advanced research and development enabled by adaptive optics technology. In order to provide maximum flexibility this topic consists of two separate tasks. Offerors may propose to one or both tasks.

	SubTask 1?AMOS Adaptive Optics Tracker and Wavefront Sensor subsystems
	Requirements should address design and development of an improved Adaptive Optics Tracker and Wavefront Sensor subsystem for the Air Force Maui Optical and Supercomputing (AMOS) Site?s 3.6-meter telescope. Solutions providing high reliability, easy maintenance and high performance for high resolution imaging and sodium laser guidestar (Na LGS) beacon for dim objects are required. This effort should include ideas for developing a modular system and interface with the adaptive optics electronics identified in Task 2 of this topic area. Out-of-the-box thinking is encouraged to develop a low-latency system providing exceptional performance on dim objects. System reliability and performance are key, however re-use of existing system components may provide cost savings. This task will also cover integration and testing of the integrated tracker, wavefront sensor and electronics subsystem (developed under Task 2) prior to delivery as well as integration and testing with the 3.6-m telescope.
	SubTask 2?Adaptive Optics Electronic subsystem
	Requirements should address design and development of an improved Electronic subsystem for the Air Force Maui Optical and Supercomputing (AMOS) Site?s 3.6-meter telescope and Starfire Optical Range?SOR?s 3.5-meter telescope. A flexible adaptive optics electronics subsystem which is capable of interfacing with multiple AO Tracker and Wavefront sensor subsystems is required. Applications for this processor will require good latency supporting a large number of channels, and the desire is deterministic timing and data output from the processor to understand system performance. Flexibility to program multiple operating modes and adjust between various control modes on the fly is desirable. The processor should be flexible enough to accommodate additional channels to allow for expansion, such as the integration of a separate WFS for Na LGS operation and focus control.  Flexible collection and reporting of performance data, diagnostics to assist in integration and characterization of tracker, wavefront and optic subsystems is desired. The estimated funding is $3,300,000.


Topic Area 3: Advanced Research Adaptive Optics Prototype

	Technical POC, Earl Spillar, (DSN 246-6740, comm 505-846-6740)

	This task involves development of a research-grade AO electronics control prototype for advanced AO research.  Flexibility in the design should allow for testing of sophisticated reconstructors, sensors, and deformable mirror configurations.  For example, these sensors may include self-referencing interferometers, shearing interferometers or other advanced concepts.  The prototype should be able to accommodate a large number of actuators and sensed sub apertures, possibly distributed across multiple deformable mirrors.  Ability to develop, test and accommodate advanced reconstruction techniques for self referencing interferometers, exponential reconstructors, and other advanced concepts is required. The estimated funding is $500K.

Topic Area 4: Hyper/multispectral Data Reduction and Archiving (HyDRA) 

	Technical POC Mr. Bob Kim (DSN 263-7806, Comm 505 853-7806)

	For Spectral Geographic Information System database solutions to enhance target acquisition and fire control for tactical high energy laser systems, such as Relay Systems. This task will provide pre/post flight and real time software advancements in target identification and change/anomaly detection for multispectral and hyperspectral surveillance and targeting sensors.
HyDRA scope of interest to AFRL/VS as well?working to develop collaborations. The estimated funding is $10,000,000.

Topic Area 5: Advanced Architecture Concept Study for Advanced Beam Control

	Technical POC Dr Paul Merritt (DSN 263-5477, Comm 505 853 5477)

	Conceptualize innovative beam control architectures for conventional (single beam) systems such as advanced pointing and tracking systems.  These new concepts may apply to alignment jitter rejection, adaptive optics, gimbal pointing, tracking, pointing, or a combination of control functions.  An inertial reference shall be included if applicable. Size and weight will be a major consideration. Considerations for base motion and aero-optics are important. The estimated funding is $300K.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<SUBJECT>58--THERMO LUMINESCENT DOSIMETER COMPUTER UPGRADE
<SOLNBR>N0016707Q5045
<CONTACT>Hugh Harrison (301)227-1123
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, (NSWCCD) has a requirement for upgrading the host computer for its Thermo Luminescence Dosimetry (TLD) reader systems from Thermo Electron Radiation Measurements and Protection, aka Thermo Eberline LLC, formerly Harshaw/Bicron NE/ Saint-Gobain Crystals & Detectors (SGCD). Thermo Electron is the original manufacturer of this equipment. It is the only company that presently has an integral knowledge of the system. Award of this contract to a source other than Thermo Electron would significantly increase the cost to the Navy by requiring that another source acquire an integral knowledge of the equipment together with the licensing authority to handle the built-in radiation source. Pursuant to FAR 6.302-l(a)(2)(ii), this highly specialized upgrade is available only from the original source, Thermo Electron, and it is likely that award to any other source would result in (a) substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and (b) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources submitting proposals within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Anticipated award date is on or around 3/9/07. Interested parties may forward capabilities statements to the point of contact no later than 2/27/07. See note #22.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAVAIR WD), China Lake, CA intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to include the requirements listed below.  This procurement is for several circuit board components that make up the Threat Signal Processor-In-The-Loop-Simulator (T-SPIL). This requirement consists of approximately 200-250 different components.  Individual components will be specified in the request for proposal.  The components are listed by Brand Name and part number as it is impractical to develop specifications for each individual component.   Anyone proposing an alternate part number/manufacturer is required to clearly demonstrate that the substitute is equal to the specified part number/manufacturer. Per PGI 211.105, a justification for using brand names is required. That justification is as follows: due to the vast quantity of electronic components being purchased, and the impracticality to describe each compone!  nt and its functionality in a manner that would promote competition, we have opted to give brand names and part numbers which allows potential offerors decide if they have a component that performs the same function.   This competitive procurement is processed under the simplified acquisition procedures at FAR Part 12 and 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The solicitation will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online website at http://www.neco.navy.mil and the FEDBIZOPPS website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about 1 March 2007.  Award is anticipated on or about 15 April 2006.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

<SUBJECT>A -- Conduct Second Follow-up of Patients Enrolled in the Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions (COMBINE) Study
<SOLNBR>NIAAA-07-07
<CONTACT>Patricia Hanacek, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-594-6226, Fax 301-443-3891, Email hanacekp@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) to conduct a second follow-up study of subjects who were previously enrolled in a multi-site randomized clinical trial (RCT) of combined medication and behavioral therapy for alcoholism.  

RTI is the one responsible source that can satisfy the Agency's requirement because (1) RTI is the sole owner of critical previously collected data on human subjects, (2)
has extensive experience necessary to conduct the study proposed  for the current contract; and  (3) no other source can supply the services and data that will satisfy agency requirements for the follow-on work for this study.

Development of the original study, called Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions (COMBINE), was initiated in 1998 and supported by NIAAA under a co-operative agreement.  Data collection was begun in 2001.  In COMBINE, 1383 subjects were randomized to medications: one, both or neither (placebo) naltrexone or acamprosate combined.  In addition to the medication subjects were assigned to either (a) a 16-week behavioral therapy or (b) no behavioral therapy.  Eleven recruitment/ treatment sites and one co-coordinating center participated in COMBINE.  Extensive information was collected on subjects, including data from numerous questionnaires over several time points, tissue samples and genetic analyses.  Staff from the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) participated in development of data collection instruments.
 
A 5-year grant for a follow-up study (Cost Effectiveness of Alcohol Treatment) was awarded to RTI in 2002.  Eight hundred thirty-five subjects and 9 of the 11 original study sites participated in this, the first COMBINE follow-up study.  Follow-up data but no treatments were administered under this study.  A series of in-person interviews were conducted at the 9 participating sites.  Data collection for this study will conclude in the fall of 2006.  Most participants at the 9 sites provided informed consent to (a) be interviewed and (b) have their data from the COMBINE study, with identifiers, linked to data collected under the first-follow-up study.  Under the grant mechanism, these data belong to the grantee, RTI.  In addition to these data, the study maintained records of subject location information and one or two personal contacts useful for tracing subjects who moved and/or changed phone numbers.  

For cost and efficiency purposes, NIAAA plans to conduct the second COMBINE follow-up study using a single contractor (RTI) and telephone interviews.  The contractor will help design and gain Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of the study.  Confidential contact information, already maintained through the RTI grant, will be used to track currently-enrolled subjects.  Subjects will be provided with details of the new follow-up study and asked to provide informed consent for the new study.  Four half-hour telephone interviews, planned at yearly intervals, will be administered to consenting subjects.  Development of the interviews will be done by personnel familiar with the COMBINE and first follow-up instruments.  As in the first follow-up study, subjects will be asked for their consent to link the data from COMBINE and the first follow-up studies with the second follow-up study.  These procedures require that the contractor have access to confidential identifiers and other data.  

Substantial data (including participants' confidentially provided data and list of contacts) which is required to conduct the current study is owned by RTI.  Furthermore, participants' confidential information may not be passed on to another research organization without prior consent of each participant.  As RTI has the unique resources to provide the particular research services proposed, a sole source contract to RTI is the only means to conduct the second follow-up phase as described.  

Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302-1, the Research Triangle Institute is the only source capable of performing this requirement due their ownership of the data and prerequisite knowledge and experience because of their work under the Cooperative Agreement and performing as the grantee for the COMBINE study under the NIAAA Grant.   

To begin anew with a different source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition as well as unacceptable delays in obtaining the required data.   

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements as described above.  A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposal, nor is an RFP available.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Marine Biological Laboratory, 7 MBL Street, Woods Hole, MA 02543 to modify, improve and calibrate the current version of Multiple Element Limitation (MEL-IV) model developed by the Marine Biological Laboratory.  The required calibration of the MEL model and its linkage to the surface hydrology model shall specifically address the down-slope transport of water and nutrients to receiving waters.  This requirement is not adequately addressed by the current version of the linked models, and represents a critical step toward accurately forecasting the disruption of the terrestrial processes that control the transport of nutrients to surface waters. The algorithms used in this MEL model are unique and represent the state of the science. The MEL model and code were developed by Marine Biological Laboratory, therefore,  EPA believes this is the only vendor qualified with the expertise capable of satisfying this requirement.  The circumstance permitting "Other than Full and Open Competition" is FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" at this time.  The anticipated period of performance is 12 months.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.   The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist, therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Robin S. Harris (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, 4930 Page Road, Durham, NC 27703 or email to harris.robin@epa.gov.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

Introduction:

       The CPSC is concerned about the hazards posed to youth under 16 years of age riding All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs).  Incidents related to ATVs can result in death or serious injuries and/or lasting disabilities to youth.  CPSC staff has studied ATVs for many years, most recently in responding to a 2002 petition requesting a ban on the sale of adult four-wheeled ATVs for use by children  and in developing a briefing package recommending that the Commission approve a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) that would set mechanical, labeling, point of sale, instruction, and training requirements for ATVs.   The NPR was subsequently approved by the Commission and published in the August 16, 2006, Federal Register.  

       In 2001, there were an estimated 2.8 million ATV drivers under the age of 16, and another 4.4 million children rode ATVs as passengers.  Children under 16 sustained about 31% of the estimated ATV-related injuries in 2001, and the societal costs associated with all medically attended injuries to children under 16 that year are estimated to be $2.5 billion.  The societal costs of ATV-related deaths to children in 2001 are estimated to have amounted to about $550 million.   Eighty-nine percent of child drivers who were injured were driving an adult ATV at the time.  Based on injury and exposure data estimated from surveys conducted in 2001, the risk of injury to drivers under the age of 16 on adult ATVs was roughly twice the risk for child drivers on youth ATVs.   

       The CPSC staff is considering various means to try to reduce youth deaths and injuries related to ATVs.  Since the risk to youth on adult ATVs is much higher than on youth ATVs, CPSC encourages all youth to ride appropriate youth ATVs.  For more background information on this issue, please see the staff briefing packages and other documents available on CPSC?s Web site (go to http://www.cpsc.gov/cgi-bin/foia.aspx, select All Terrain Vehicles, and click on Find).  The relevant documents with human factors information are as follows (in order of date, beginning with the most recent):
- CPSC Staff Response Regarding Follow-Up Questions from Commissioner Moore after ATV Safety Review Briefing, dated 07/11/2006, Youth ATVs: Questions 1 through 7 (beginning on p. 3 of 18), and Question 9 (beginning on p.7 of 18),
- CPSC Staff Response to Commissioner Nancy Nord after the June 15, 2006 ATV Safety Review Briefing, dated 06/30/2006, Question 3 (beginning on p. 3 of 7) and Question 4 (beginning on p.5 of 7),  
- All Terrain Vehicle Initiative, Part 2, dated 05/31/2006, especially Tabs H (p.138 of 229 through p.149 of 229) and I (p.150 of 229 through p.157 of 229),
- Response to Questions from Commissioner Moore on CP-02-4/HP-02-1; Petition Requesting Ban of All-Terrain Vehicles Sold for Use by Children under Age 16, dated 08/22/2005, Question 8 (beginning on p. 3 of 6),
- Analysis of Petition CP-02-3/HP-02-1 - Requesting Ban of ATVs Sold for the Use of Children Under Age 16 - Part 3, dated 02/02/2005, especially Tab H (p. 39 of 55 through p. 55 of 55), and
 - Analysis of Petition CP-02-3/HP-02-1 - Requesting Ban of ATVs Sold for the Use of Children Under Age 16 - Part 4, dated 02/02/2005, especially Tab I (p. 1 of 43 through p.6 of 43). 

       One of the strategies being proposed by the Commission to encourage youth to select appropriate ATVs is to characterize youth ATVs by speed rather than engine size, as is currently done.  The table below summarizes the category recommendations for ATVs as proposed in the Commission?s August 16, 2006, NPR.

CPSC?s Proposed ATV Models and Intended Ages
ATV Model  Age (years)	Speed Range  Headlights	Conspicuity lights	Tail Lights
Junior	6+	10 mph or less	None	Allowed	Required
Pre-teen	9+	10*-15 mph	None	Allowed	Required
Teen	12+	15*-30 mph	None	Allowed	Required
Adult	16+	Not restricted	Allowed	Allowed	Required
	* with speed limiter	

Request:

       The CPSC staff is interested in obtaining ideas, data, concepts, and feasibility information for human performance and behavioral research that supports or refutes the ATV requirements proposed for each category listed above.  CPSC staff realizes that, while the ideal of eliminating all hazards associated with ATV driving is not feasible, it may be possible to reduce the number of deaths and the severity of injuries, especially to youth.   

       The category recommendations listed in the above table are based on the existing voluntary standard  and on published child development data reviewed by CPSC staff, including research on teen automobile driving.  There are, however, factors CPSC staff has been unable to investigate due to the lack of available research regarding youth ATV drivers.   CPSC staff is aware of little published data regarding the motorized vehicle driving skills of youth under age 16 even though some youth may have years of experience on dirt bikes and ATVs.  CPSC staff therefore would like to consider the feasibility of research specifically focused on youth ATV driving.  

General Questions:

       Responders should provide descriptions of the options available for obtaining human performance data regarding youth driving ATVs.  CPSC staff is particularly interested in the feasibility of obtaining data related to:
1)	Human factors research related to vehicle design factors that may be relevant to youth ATV drivers such as:
a.	Appropriate speed
b.	Appropriate maximum ATV weight and/or driver weight to ATV weight ratio
c.	Control design factors that may be specific to youth driving
2)	Nighttime off-road driving performance and behavior of youth as compared to youth driving performance during daylight and adult driving performance, both during daylight and at night.
3)	Youth distractibility while driving ATVs.
4)	The effects of peer pressure and the extent to which youth ATV drivers may be more or less susceptible to peer pressure than youth automobile drivers. 

       Responders should address the following questions in their submissions:
1)   What are the possible methods that could be employed to collect the desired data?
2)   Are there examples of existing research that have proven successful in collecting the desired data?
3) Is there existing research regarding the off-road driving skills of youth?
4)  What other human performance and behavior factors that may be relevant to youth  ATV driving could and/or should be studied?
5) Would there be difficulties related to obtaining youth participants for a study of  driving behavior (e.g., finding volunteers, research ethics, etc)?
6)  What is a reasonable rough estimate of the time, cost, and other resources needed for such a study?

Driving Simulator Specific Questions:

       CPSC staff is aware that one possible method for obtaining the needed data may be through use of driving simulators.  Responders who are familiar with simulator studies should provide documentation on the technical feasibility of using existing driving simulators to obtain human performance data regarding youth driving ATVs.  CPSC staff is particularly interested in the feasibility of obtaining data related to the maximum appropriate speeds for various categories of youth drivers and the nighttime driving performance of youth as compared to youth driving performance during daylight and adult driving performance both during the day and at night.
       
       Responders who wish to address simulator research should also address the following questions in their submissions:
1) Is the study of ATV driving with driving simulators a pragmatic, valid, and cost- effective methodology?
2)  Are there existing high fidelity simulators for ATVs or similar motorized vehicles?
3)  Can children be successful participants in a driving simulator study?
4)  Can driving simulators accurately test nighttime driving skills?
5)  Would a simulator be able to accurately reproduce the lighting effects of headlights?
6)  Is it feasible to obtain data with a simulator suggesting maximum appropriate speeds for various categories of youth ATVs?
7)  What other human performance and behavioral factors could be studied in a driving simulator that may be relevant to youth ATV driving?
8) Would the prevalence of driving-type video games that may be used by youth confound data obtained?
9) How do simulator studies translate to off-road driving conditions? How do participants alter their behavior when using a simulator versus when driving in an actual off-road environment?  

How to Respond:

       Responses should be in the form of reports or letters discussing the likely success of research projects aimed at acquiring the data listed above, and including factual support for the assertions made therein.   If the responder provides a compilation of published example studies from other sources, the results should be summarized. 

       Responses to this Request for Information (RFI) are to be submitted directly to the Contracting Office address indicated above, Attn: Rudi Johnson no later than 02 April 2007.

This extension will allow the completion of negotiations under solicitation SPM4A6-07-R-0009 to conclude without loss of critical contract support by Safety Kleen under the expiring contract. This extension is justified pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  Safety Kleen is the only known source of supply and services because Safety Kleen is the only known CONUS manufacturer of re-refined motor oil with at least 25% re-refined content in 5W30, 10W30, 10W40, 40W, 15W40, 10W and 30W grades. Safety Kleen is the only known source of supply that provides these oil products with re-refined content and removes used motor oil from CONUS customer locations. The anticipated value of the 30 day extension is $67,712.86.

Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The DoD is seeking vendor solutions that provide real-time, online, integrated, credential verification, identity authentication, and access authorization system.  This Physical Access Control (PAC) effort is designed to increase physical security by allowing access to valid DoD credential holders, and by vetting visitors and vendors who frequent DoD facilities and installations and providing these vendors servicing DoD facilities and installations, a method to more quickly gain access to these facilities to conduct official business.  

b. Participation in this Project, on the part of vendors desiring access to DoD facilities, is voluntary.  Key components of this Project include: demonstration of software; demonstration of architecture, demonstration on the ability to credential those who are not authorized DoD credentials, demonstration of the ability to complete background checks on companies and employees, the implementation of authentication and credentialing capabilities.  

c. The Contractor shall be required to:

i.	Interface with the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) databases, web services and regional infrastructure for authoritative data on DoD personnel and interface with other databases thus improving security and access control.   Software communication between DMDC and external systems is handled through web services and standard interfaces.   

ii.	(NOTE:  Physical access systems, identity management systems, and other types of systems communicate with DMDC Web Services (DWS) with Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messages. To request data from Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIDS), these systems must be able to connect directly or wirelessly to a regional network and send SOAP request messages and receive SOAP response messages.  Integrated systems become network nodes acting as a service requestor. These nodes send a SOAP request message to the DMDC web service (DWS) which acts as a Service Provider. The DWS retrieves the requested data and sends a SOAP response message to the Service Requester. A client program connecting to the DMDC web service can read the Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) document to determine what functions are available from the Service Provider. The client can then use SOAP messages to call one of the functions listed in the WSDL document for DMDC web service. Clients format SOAP messages with specific DMDC data requests. The DMDC web service formats SOAP response messages that contain the requested information, or an error message indicating the information could not be found.)

iii.	Capture fake/lost/stolen ID cards - An automated process which identifies that the credential being presented was reported as lost/stolen.

iv.	Link identity verification and credential verification.

v.	Take multiple biometrics at enrollment which enables biometric matching later.  

vi.	Revoke base access and transmit the revocation to all access points in the infrastructure.

vii.	Capture and maintain an audit history capability of who and how many people enter a facility.

viii.	Limit access based upon Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs).

ix.	Provide an authenticated verification of identity (target - two to six seconds).

x.	 Provide simple equipment operation for security force personnel.

xi.	Provide a method for Participant companies to enroll in the program. Enrollment shall be made available at each participant installation and facility.

xii.	Conduct Background Screening on Participating Companies and Selected Personnel.

xiii.	Conduct screening for visitors.

xiv.	Meet all privacy, Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), networthiness, privacy, security and regulatory requirements. 

2. GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF COVERAGE:

<DESC>Introduction: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), of the United States Department of Transportation, is responsible for reducing the number of injuries and deaths on highways resulting from vehicle crashes.  On January 1, 1981, The NHTSA issued Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 213, Child Restraint Systems.  FMVSS No. 213 specifies various performance tests which include material test and dynamic test.  FMVSS No. 213 sets forth the performance requirements for many types of child restraint systems.  It includes the testing provisions which are necessary to determine whether a restraint system meets those performance requirements.  The test provisions include material tests which are intended to verify webbing, hardware and other components of a child restraint system comply with the requirements of those components. 

Specific Requirements:  NHTSA intends to procure testing services and reports so that the Government can determine whether child restraint system components comply with the requirements of FMVSS No. 213. The Contractor shall furnish the necessary qualified technical personnel, facilities, and equipment to perform testing services necessary to determine conformance of child restraint components, provided to the contractor as Government Furnished Test Items (GTFI), with the applicable requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 213, Child Restraint Systems. Either whole child restraints or individual components will be provided. 

Contract Award:   NHTSA intends to award a single, Firm-Fixed- Price contract with a base year to include optional quantities during year one (1) of the contract.  The contract will also include a provision by which two 24-month option periods can be exercised (in two-year increments) resulting in a total possible performance period of five (5) years. 

This solicitation is full and open competition. 

Solicitation:  The solicitation DTNH22-07-R-00011 will be available for downloading from http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ on or about February 26, 2007.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide clarification to additional questions received:

(1) Which parts of the two existing contracts are each of the incumbents supporting?  One contract supports the U-2 Electronic Warfare Support and the other contract supports all remaining descriptions as outlined in the draft PWS. (2) Are we required to have a Facility Security Clearance for this contract? Yes--military and GS personnel will manage JPAS. (3) Which volume of the proposal submission package will contain the completed RFP and any amendments?  There isn't an assigned volume for these documents; when the final solicitation is issued, it will provide specific instructions on what to include in your proposal package. (4) Technical proposal sub-factor mentions both Quality Program Plan and Quality Control Plan--which is required?  We will require a Quality Control Plan. (5) For the technical proposal ratings, will sub-factor 1 be given a higher value than sub-factor 2? At this time, this has not been determined. (6) Will each of the positions listed be manned one-to-one or more than one person be needed to man a particular position?  This is not a position based contract; this will be performance-based.  We will provide the descriptions of tasks that require completion and each proposal should include a proposed manning and management structure. (7) Where will "Information Technology Management Support" take place?  This support will provided at a squadron level. (8) What are the largest challenges the 9 RW is currently experiencing? In operations and mission support, the challenge is the flexibility of overseas and TDY staffing.  In training and scheduling, the challenge is identifying and preventing confusion on the chain of command.  Overall, the largest challenges are Air Force wide cost constraints and budget reductions. (9) When will the final RFP be issued?  We are continuing to finalize our requirement and do not have a specific date at this time; however, we anticipate posting the final RFP in late February/early March.

<DESC>THIS PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE IS BEING ADVERTISED AS FULL AND OPEN/UNRESTRICTED.  The Request for Proposal will be issued ON OR ABOUT February 16, 2007. Full proposal will be found on Naval Facilities E-Solicitation site at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil/.  A pre-proposal conference and site visit is currently scheduled ON OR ABOUT MARCH 1, 2007.  The proposal due date is currently scheduled ON OR ABOUT APRIL 16, 2007.

The size standard is $31,000,000.00.  This is a fully designed project with a construction project dollar range between $20,000,000 and $26,000,000.  The estimated performance period for design and construction is 554 days from contract award.

1. PROJECT TITLE:  CONSTRUCTION OF A CONSOLIDATED FUEL FACILITY AT NAVAL AIR STATION WHIDBEY ISLAND, OAK HARBOR, WA

2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION.  This is a fully designed project consisting of the following major categories of work:

(1)  Fuel Storage Tank Construction.  This project includes the construction of a large consolidated fuel facility consisting of three (3) 30,000 barrel above-ground steel tanks with floating pans to store JP-8 jet fuel.  These field constructed tanks will be built to the American Petroleum Institute API - 650 standards.  Two (2) 40,000 gallon commercial aboveground steel tanks will be built for JP-5 fuel storage.  Dual fuel pump & filter house, four (4) lanes of loading/unloading stations for fuel trucks, secondary containment structures, cathodic protection, automatic tank gauging, storm drainage, site utilities, fire protection, emergency generators, access pavements, fencing, lighting and security systems will be required.  At another location, this project upgrades fuel booster pumps to increase fuel transfer rate on the existing cross island pipeline which will connect the new consolidated fuel facility with the existing fuel pier for barge delivery approximately 6 miles away.        

(2) Fuel Operations Building Construction.  This project includes the demolition of an existing fuels operations building and construction of a new facility of approximately 3,400 square feet (SF).  The new building will house the fuel manager?s office, dispatch office, driver ready room, fuel laboratory and a small shop for limited repair to fuel trucks.  The new building also consolidates all the instrumentation related to fuel truck dispatch, existing pipeline leak detection system, new tank gaging systems, and other instrumentation related to pipeline fuel transfer operations.

(3) Decommissioning of Existing Fuel Farms.  This project will close, in place, 16 existing field constructed underground fuel tanks ranging in age from 50 - 60 years old.  The tanks are located at four (4) separate fuel farms; two (2) near the Seaplane Base fuel pier; and two (2) at Ault Field Naval Air Station across the island.  The existing fuel storage facilities includes approximately 13 concrete tanks at 250,000 gallons each, two (2) steel tanks at 560,000 gallons, and one (1) steel tank at 154,000 gallons.  The tanks will be cleaned, tank closure samples taken, and reports prepared.  The tank shells will be closed in place by filling with soil.  The tank pump houses and all aboveground features will be demolished.  Underground piping within the tank farms and one of the two cross island pipelines will be flushed, capped and operationally closed.  

(4) This contract will be structured to include a base bid item and several optional items.  The base bid item will be awarded.  Options will be awarded as funding is made available, either with initial contract award or up to 120 days after contract award.  The base bid item is for the Fuel Storage Tank Construction.  Option items will be the Automatic Tank Gauging Equipment for tanks 1 through 3, Automatic Tank Gauging Equipment for Tanks 4 & 5, Physical Security Equipment, Emergency Generators, Fueling Truck Rack Canopy and Weather Shelters, Tank Closure and Demo of Fuel Farm #1, #2, #3, #4, New Fuel Ops Building, JP-5 Tank Fueling System.

CHALLENGES:  NAS Whidbey Island is located outside the large metropolitan areas of Seattle and Everett Washington by approximately 60 to 90 miles.   Due to phased construction requirements (e.g., new facilities must be built, commissioned and the stored fuel transferred to the new facility before the decommissioning work can start), a lengthy construction period is anticipated.  Demolition of the existing Fuels Operations Building and other ancillary buildings may involve some asbestos and lead abatement work.

3. SITE ANALYSIS.  The project is located at Naval Air Station (NAS) Whidbey Island, Oak Harbor, Washington.  The new facility site will be located in undeveloped property adjacent to a fuel tanker parking area.  The area will require pre-loading of the existing soils over approximately half the project site due to varying subsurface conditions.  

4.  The Government will award one Firm-Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible, responsive proposer whose proposal conforms to the solicitation considered to be the ?best value? to the Government, price and technical factors considered.

<DESC>1.6 Meter Telescope/Source Sought Synopsis.  This synopsis is a Source Sought Notice ONLY.   This is NOT a request for proposal (RFP).  NO solicitation is being issued at this time, and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought notice is voluntary.  Responses will not be returned.  No entitlement to payment or direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to the Government.  The information obtained from industry?s responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP.  In the following sources sought synopsis the 
The US Air Force Academy (USAFA) has acquired a 1.6 meter segmented parabolic mirror, together with supporting optical and electronic components. We wish to transform the central segment of this mirror (a hexagon approximately 1.6 meters across) into a ground-based fast-tracking/steering telescope for low earth orbit (LEO) satellite imaging. In addition, the potential contractor will construct a small building to house the telescope, with required HVAC and electrical support. This structure will be located at USAFA (Colorado Springs, CO), near our existing observatory, and will be surmounted by a dome to be constructed by the contractor to provide climate protection for the telescope. It is the Government?s intent to have one primary contractor, who will oversee the design and construction of this requirement, though the ?dome? portion of the project, as well as others, may be subcontracted.
After separation from its existing supports and recoating, the parabolic mirror will be provided to the potential contractor as GFE. The mirror was originally constructed as part of the Large Aperture Mirror Program (LAMP), and consists of 7 segments (a central hexagon and 6 "petals"). It is made of 17mm thick Ultra-Low Expansion glass and has a focal length of 5m. 

The designer and builder of the "telescope" portion of the project will be required to construct the fast steering mount, primary mirror support (cell), truss (to support the secondary mirror), secondary mirror and assembly, tertiary mirror and assembly, and two Nasmyth-style instrument platforms, together with the control electronics necessary for this system. In addition, the successful bidder will be required to interface the telescope control electronics with those of the dome (so the dome is fully operational). The contractor will also be expected to provide operation and maintenance training as well as detailed documentation. It is anticipated that this requirement will be a design build, and the primary contractor  will work closely with other contractors as well as the Government when constructing the dome, pier (telescope foundation), and observatory building itself, in order to ensure that the specifications are met.
  Potential sources must provide the following information:
  
1.	Evidence that they have completed similar type of work, including
design, construction, and integration of telescopes of this scale and capability.
2.	Ability to subcontract as necessary to qualified sources, and to oversee such subcontracts. Alternatively, the ability to team with other contractors on the original proposal to accomplish same.
3.	History of completion of similar projects on schedule and within
original budget.
4.	Evidence of relevant expertise on team, including, but not limited
to, qualified optical engineers, software engineers, and mechanical/structural engineers.
5.	While the telescope is not envisioned as an operational AF asset, the telescope will primarily be used for satellite imaging and other Space Situational Awareness (SSA) activities. Accordingly, we require evidence of substantial experience (3 years or more) working in these areas, and evidence of awareness of current DoD SSA operational requirements.
6.     Evidence the potential contractor has engaged in this type of  business for over 5 (five) years, has the necessary equipment, personnel, and financial resources to fulfill the requirements of this contract.  

All respondents shall indicate their size status in relation to the applicable NAICS code 5451710  (Size Standard 500 employees).  Also identify and address if they are a large or small, 8(a), women owned, HUBZone, or otherwise classified as a small disadvantaged business in their response.  All interested firms shall submit a capabilities package that outlines their firm?s capabilities in providing all of the above mentioned requirements.  The capabilities packages should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements.  Previous experience in all areas should be provided.  Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated.  The response must not exceed 25 single-spaced, 10 point typed pages.  Submit the packages within 30 calendar days after publication of this announcement to Ms. Kelly Snyder, 10 MSG/LGCA, 8110 Industrial Dr, US Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs CO 80840, telephone 719-333-2869.

<DESC>This synopsis is posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) webpage located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  Vendors should regularly access the specified websites to ensure they have downloaded any and all amendments. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) is seeking information on Data Link Equipment from responsible sources, from all segments of the industry sector, including small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and woman-owned small businesses, and firms that may not regularly do business with the Government.  A requirement for Data Link Equipment may be synopsized at a future date, to support field testing of various sensors in a maritime environment.  The equipment is expected to be comprised of multiple, full duplex, data links between multiple platforms (maximum of three platforms) and is expected to include both sides of the link, transmitter and receiver, for each of the full duplex links and encompass all equipment from data input to RF output, including modems, transmitters, receivers, and antennas.  Input/Output to and from the data link equipment will be via Ethernet interface operating at a maximum data rate of 24 Mbps (that number includes networ!  k overhead).  Each direction of each data link must support that data rate.  Data link equipment will primarily be operated in an over water setting (Potomac River and Virginia Capes regions) between various ship platforms, so mitigation of multi-path losses should be addressed in link budget calculations.       MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS for the Data Link equipment are: 1.	Maximum distance between platforms will be seven kilometers.  Mast heights (for installation of antenna equipment) may vary from 10 feet above water level to 70 feet above water level.   2.	Each platform will support one set of data links to each of two other geographically dispersed platforms, for a maximum of two data links per platform.  All links will be operated simultaneously.  Respondents should address the scheme (frequency division multiplex, antenna polarization, other) selected, in order to ensure simultaneous operation of multiple links between multiple platforms without unsuitable interference from one data link to another.   3.	Un-gimbaled pan/tilt units will be provided for antenna mounting onboard ship.  Antenna pointing solutions will be calculated by external equipment not part of the Data Link Equipment sought here.   4.	The equipment will not be required to operate in fog or anything greater than light rain conditions (< .2 mm/hr).  The systems shall be operable in up to Sea State 2 conditions and be able to survive Sea State 5 shock and vibration conditions when not operating.  Temperature and humidity operational ranges for equipment located above deck (uncontrolled) are 10o to 50oC at 95% relative humidity.     5.	Each link will support a maximum unavailability of 1%.  Each link will perform, at worst case, with a raw bit error rate of 1 X 10-6.   6.	One set of data link equipment will be required to operate in the dense electromagnetic environment of a U.S. Navy ship.  Sufficient filtering will be required to minimize RF interference between the data link equipment and other shipboard transmitters/receivers.   DESIRABLE FEATURES.  Equipment possessing some, or all, the following additional features is desired: 1.	Specification of transmit/receive equipment that can operate over multiple frequency bands is preferable, as is transmit equipment with adjustable power output levels.   2.	Specification of modem equipment that supports multiple modulation types and multiple data rates is preferable.  Equipment that supports higher data rates than those listed above is preferable.  Equipment that supports Forward Error Correction is preferable.   3.	Where the link budget permits, utilization of omni-directional vice directional antennas is preferable.     4.	The system will, primarily, be operated at DOD ranges.  For frequency approval purposes, it is preferable that the link equipment specified operate in at least one of the following MOBILE communications bands (as specified by the FCC): 1350 to 1390 MHz, 1755 to 1850 MHz, 4400 to 4900 MHz, 14.5 to 15.35 GHz, 21.2 to 23.6 GHz.   RESPONSES SOUGHT.  Interested sources should submit the following information: 1.	A list of equipment, with model numbers, to meet the requirements specified above.  The list should note any equipment that is not off-the-shelf, i.e., equipment that must be developed to satisfy this requirement.  The Government intent is to maximize the use of Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) equipment for this effort.  The list should indicate whether proposed equipment can be located in controlled spaces or must be mounted close to the antenna.   2.	A link budget calculation.  Calculation should note any assumptions made in generating the link budget.   3.	Rough order of magnitude costs for the equipment set defined by the respondent.   4.	Estimate of time from contract award to delivery of equipment to the Government.  Provide a list of long lead time items for planning purposes. Questions and responses should be submitted, in Microsoft Word format, no later than 12 March 2007 to DLGR_NSWC_XDS13@NAVY.MIL and should reference this sources sought number: N00178-07-Q-3008. Please include your company CAGE code (if you have one) and POC information with your response. This synopsis/sources sought does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals, nor a Request for Quotations, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a contract or an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  This synopsis is issued for informational purposes only.  Responses in any form are not offers.  There are no funds available to pay for the cost of preparing responses to this synopsis.

<DESC>This is not a request for proposals. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. Reimbursement will not be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.
U.S. Coast Guard Air Station San Francisco located at the International Airport in San Francisco, CA is searching for sources that can provide literature, plans, etc. in response to this announcement within 14 days of this announcement.

The Government is searching for sources that can assess, design new or alter an existing stair system and complete the installation of a vertical entry system into an existing elevated shop space above an aviation hangar.  The current access to the space is accomplished using a long diagonal staircase system with the use of one intermediate landing separating an upper and lower section of stairs both with separate slopes.  The upper stair system is much steeper and creates a potential falling hazard.  The final solution should include an entry method compliant with local building codes and OSHA requirements for personnel safety including the slope of the stairs, appropriate use of intermediate landings, and an adequate handrail to prevent personal falls and injuries.  The Government is also interested in examining all possible solutions to shop entry including the installation of an elevator.  All companies that can meet the specification are encouraged to provide a capability statement, company literature, brochures, or any other information that demonstrates that the specifications can be met.

Any questions concerning the technical specifications or to schedule a tour of the existing aircraft servicing locations should be directed to LCDR Ed Sheppard at 650-808-2950 or Edward.B.SheppardJr@uscg.mil and other questions should be directed to Mrs. Deborah Cefaratti at 510-437-3195 or Deborah.S.Cefaratti@uscg.mil .

For FY09, the deadline for submission of pre-proposals is 3:00 PM CST, 14 March 2008 for the funding cycle that begins 1 October 2008, and the deadline for submission of full technical proposals is 3:00 PM CST, 16 May 2008.  Proposals received after the due date will be considered only if funds remain available.  The format for pre-proposals and proposals may be obtained from the Program Assistant, Lisa Williams at 850-230-3205 or E-mail: lisa.m.williams@navy.mil.  The Pre-proposal should be three to five pages of text and should include an estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for each year of the proposed effort.  A curriculum vitae of the principal investigator(s) should be appended together with any supporting information, such as reprints or preprints, which will assist in the evaluation of the pre-proposal.   Offerors submitting the most promising pre-proposals will be invited to submit a full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their pre-proposal submission. However, any such invitation does not obligate the Government to make an award.  Any offeror may submit a full technical proposal even if its pre-proposal was not identified as promising or if no pre-proposal is submitted; however any full proposal submission would be made without the benefit of feedback prior to full proposal submission.  A completed animal use protocol with supporting documentation is required when animals are employed.  Any proposal that involves the experimental use of human subjects must include a separate evaluation of proposed technical approaches and associated risks by the contractors committee for protection of human subjects.  This evaluation must conform with current Department of the Navy instructions relating to the use of human subjects, DODD 3126.2 and SECNAVINST 3900.39C.  Offeror!  s must state in their pre-proposals and full proposals that it is submitted in response to this BAA.  This BAA provides no funding for pre-proposals or subsequent proposal development purposes.  All pre-proposals will be acknowledged.  Proposals will not be returned after evaluation.  (3) Criteria for Selecting Proposals, their Relative Importance, and the Method of Evaluation  Pre-proposal and full technical proposal submissions will be evaluated on (1) the overall basis of innovation and scientific merit; (2) the relevance to submarine escape, rescue, and diving; (3) the overall value and affordability of the proposal; and (4) the offerors capabilities, strengths and weaknesses or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives.  The Government reserves the right to select for funding any, all, part or none of the responses received. For efforts funded as contracts, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities.  This is to notify potential offerors that each contract that may be placed under this announcement, or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the fol!  lowing clause:  As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) an entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students.  If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative payments unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award. If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any contract, including any existing contract, (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a contract or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation." See instructions above for pre-proposals and proposals. The Governments preference is to award definitive contracts under this BAA. However, an award can be made via grant at the sole discretion of the Government.  All responsive sources may submit proposals that will be considered by NSWCPC.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals or join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete and severable areas of submarine escape, rescue, and diving for exclusive competition among these entities.  This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d) (2) (i).  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.

A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs
- Sun Rack 900-38 with front door and PDS installed
- Sun Rack power cable
- Sun Rack power jumper cables

A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.
The issue is not compatibility, but rather, adding another vendor (variable) that could impact our high-availability and if that item fails and we need to request service from yet another vendor.  If we acquire the Sun rack, it will be maintained under the current agreement.  We have invested heavily with redundancy of key components to achieve this desired availability.  Adding another variable would increase the risk in our ability to meet the desired level of availability. 

NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE.  Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than February 14, 2007 at 8:00 A.M. EST.  A request for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered an affirmative response.

This agency intends to negotiate and possibly award a fixed priced contract to CyberDefenses Inc. 1205 Sam Bass Rd, Ste 300, Roun d Rock, TX 78681-4251. CyberDefenses is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business. The primary objectives of the Statement of Work (SOW) are to obtain critically needed services for emergency operations before the annual hurricane season, standardize and improve existing and less-than-adequate processes in a manner consistent with Inform ation Technology Enterprise Architecture Management System (ITEAMS), Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) best practices for Service Support and Service Level Management. Sole source determination is based on the following:  Cyber Defenses, Inc. is the developer of the content, uniquely qualified in providing services, developer of the training, developer of the software and consequently the best and only known qualified vendor currently available to provide the required servi ces.    A greater percentage of the items to be purchased under this statement of work have already been produced and delivered to other National Guard Units, under the Kentucky National Guard completed contract.  Follow up services and additional support for the Louisiana National Guard will preclude initiating, learning and long start-up curve and other possible delays under a new contract and new contractor.  The selected contractor has intimate knowledge of National Guard operations and has recent expertise d eveloping, integrating and implementing the needed services by this agency. Search based on National Guard requirements has been conducted by the different National Guard Units over the last four years.  A recent market search has been conducted under ITEMS and ITIL service providers with little return in finding a vendor well ali gned and understanding of National Guard needs to the level found in the selected contractor. Full and open competition for this level of effort is not deemed necessary as stated above and exception sought under FAR 5.202; exception.  No solicitation package will be issued.      This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, responses received by February 22, 2007 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.     Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whet her to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>--Open Season for the Programmatic EXPRESS Domain
<DESC>The US Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) announces an open season for the Programmatic Domain under the Expedited Professional and Engineering Support Services (EXPRESS) program.  EXPRESS is a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) program based up on the use of GSA Federal Supply Schedules for acquiring advisory and assistance services (including all supervision, labor, incidental materials, and travel).  These services may take the form of information, advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, eval uations, recommendations, training, and technical and management support.  The complete scope of work for each domain may be reviewed on the website listed below.  Four competitively awarded BPAs have been established in the EXPRESS Programmatic Domain.  The BPAs were established with a provision for an annual open season in which the government may add additional BPA teams or allow existing Prime Contractors/Team Le aders the opportunity to restructure existing teams.  The purpose of the current open season will allow the existing EXPRESS Programmatic Domain Prime Contractors/Team Leaders to restructure existing teams to include adding new team members and subcontract ors, deleting current team members and subcontractors, changing current subcontractors to team members, changing current team members to subcontractors, and/or revising teaming arrangement(s) to respond to future EXPRESS task order requirements.  Parties i nterested in participating as a team member (GSA Schedule required), subcontractor (no GSA Schedule required) or providing incidental materials (GSA Schedule preferred), are encouraged to pursue appropriate arrangements with the current EXPRESS Programmati c Domain Prime Contractor/Team Leaders.  A list of the current EXPRESS Prime Contractors/Team Leaders may be found on the AMCOM EXPRESS website located at https://amcomexpress.redstone.army.mil.  This website also contains a link to each BPA teams website  for additional information. To restructure teaming relationships on existing BPAs, Prime Contractors/Team Leaders are requested to forward submission via email and required to submit one CD-ROM electronically containing the following information:  a team matrix that identifies both c urrent and planned team members/subcontractors; a revised Attachment 4 (Team File); and an updated RFQ Attachment 9 (Performance Capability Team File).  The current format for Attachment 4 shall be updated to incorporate a separate worksheet that lists eac h team member according to its paying office if different from the primes.  Formats for Attachments 4 and 9 can be found on the EXPRESS website under the Open Season link.  Responses to this open season announcement are due no later than 1400 (CST) on 15 M arch 2007 to the following address:  COMMANDER, U.S. Army Aviation & Missile Command, ATTN:  AMSAM-AC-OS-O/Jeannie King, Sparkman Center, Building 5303, Redstone Arsenal, AL  35898.

<DESC>Military Sealift Fleet Support Command (MSFSC) Ship Support Unit (SSU) Guam anticipates entering into a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with several rental car companies to supply rental car services to MSFSC assets on the island of Guam.  

This acquisition will follow Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12--Acquisition Of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  

Due to the anticipated dollar thresholds involved, per FAR 13.003(b)(1), this acquisition will be reserved exclusively for small business concerns, as defined in FAR Part 19.

Currently, MSFSC SSU Guam receives 10 to 12 rental car requests per month, with 5 to 8 vehicles per request.  Typical rental periods average 5 to 7 days.  However, some rental requests can be for as long as 30 days.  

The attached Statement Of Work (SOW) contains the service/performance requirements of the BPA.  

Vendors interested in entering into a BPA with the Government should review the attached SOW, and submit pricing (daily, weekly, and monthly rates) for the classes of vehicles identified on the Commercial Vehicle Rental Price List (first page of attached SOW).  

Pricing should be submitted for as many of the vehicle classes as the vendor's inventory allows.  

Price Lists from interested vendors should be received as an email attachment no later than 23 February 2007.  Price lists should be submitted via email to Mr. Tom Bickley at the following email address:
william.bickley@msc.navy.mil

Late submissions will not be considered. 

Price lists submitted should be certified (via vendor signature) as valid for a period of not more than 12 months from the date of submission.   Price lists will be counter-signed by the contracting officer upon establishment of the BPA. 

MSFSC anticipates entering into BPAs with as many as three (3) lowest-priced, technically acceptable vendors.  

Low price will be determined by conducting a line for line comparison of submitted prices per vehicle class, specifically the daily rates for Items 0001, 0002, 0007A, 0007B, and 0008 (see Commercial Vehicle Rental Price List of the attached SOW)--as these vehicle classes and rates represent the majority of rental vehicle requests.  The low price vendor(s) will be determined by the lowest daily rates on the majority of the following vehicle classes:  Items 0001, 0002, 0007A, 0007B, and 0008.    

Technical acceptability will be established by receipt of a complete and comprehensive price list.  Failure to provide price quotes on each of the 10 classes of vehicles will render the offer technically unacceptable.

After the BPAs are established, rental vehicle requests will be rotated through the roster of selected suppliers.  It is recognized that a vendor may not be able to supply every vehicle on each request every time. However, rental requests will not be split.  If a selected vendor is not able to supply a request in its entirety, then the request will be directed to the next eligible supplier.   Per the SOW, repeated failures to supply
requested rental vehicles may result in a vendor being removed from the list of eligible vendors.

Questions regarding the performance specifications or requirements of the attached SOW should be directed via email to Mr. Tom Bickley.  Questions will be entertained through close of business, local Guam time, Friday, 16 February 2007.  

Mr. Bickley can be reached via email at william.bickley@msc.navy.mil

GREEN  A proposal that demonstrates competence and exceeds the minimum requirements of the criteria; has an above average probability of success; contains no significant weaknesses and only minor, correctable weaknesses exist. BLUE  A proposal that meets in all aspects the minimum requirements of the criteria; has a good probability of success; no significant weaknesses and any deficiencies can be readily corrected. YELLOW   A proposal that fails to meet the minimum requirements of the criteria but may meet them through negotiations; low probability of success; major weaknesses and/or significant number of deficiencies exist that may be improved or corrected through d iscussions. RED  A proposal that fails to meet minimum requirements of the criteria; proposal needs major revisions; very low probability of success. An offeror must be rated at least BLUE in all Sub-Factors (FACOTOR 1) in order to be eligible for contract award.   SUB-FACTOR A:  OVERALL MISSION UNDERSTANDING.  A demonstrated understanding of the processes and procedures required for performing services to include the functions of this contract.  To obtain a blue rating, the proposal must demonstrate an adequate unde rstanding of the services required and their mission.   SUB-FACTOR B:  PROPOSED MANAGEMENT PLAN.  (a) Core Group  The proposal must demonstrate a structure that promotes the efficient and flexible use of the offerors personnel.  (b) Surge Capabilities  The proposal must demonstrate the offerors ability to o btain the additional, temporary and/or part-time staff, with the appropriate security clearances, to satisfy shortfalls, if any and as applicable.  (c) Management Communication Style  The proposal must demonstrate an understanding of the skills required i n obtaining and retaining qualified personnel.  To obtain a blue rating, the proposal must demonstrate a clear understanding of organization, personnel management, transitioning and administrative requirements for providing these services. SUB-FACTOR C:  QUALITY ASSURANCE.  The proposal must demonstrate how the offeror expects to maintain the highest standards in the professional services delivered.  To receive a blue rating, the proposal must demonstrate a clear understanding of specific te chniques and activities to be performed, in addition to their integration and development in conjunction with the task orders.  All proposals must meet minimum standards and regulations set out in JP 3-50 and other referenced joint publications listed in t his solicitation.   SUB-FACTOR D:  PAST PERFORMANCE.  The proposal must demonstrate present and past performance as it relates to this current procurement.  All referenced contracts are required to be on-going or have been completed within the last three years.  Further, cont racts determined to be more relevant to the REF-APO requirement will be given more weight than those less similar.  If deemed necessary, the evaluation team will determine the appropriate personnel to contact for information on the offeror's present and pa st performance based on the present and past performance information and points of cont act (POCs) provided by the offeror and any Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS)-like information from other Government sources.  After receipt of the questionnaires, follow up telephone calls may be made to clarify the responses provided o r to obtain additional information.  To receive a blue rating, the proposal must show successful performance of similar contracts to this procurement. SUB-FACTOR E: SECURITY ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS.  The proposal must demonstrate the offerors ability to maintain a full training cadre at the minimum level of security eligibility outlined in this RFP.  The proposal should display the offerors understand ing of Department of the Army security requirements as they pertain to the RFP and REF-APO requirements.  Interim DoD security eligibilities are acceptable, Secret or Above.  The security eligibility requirements in this RFP are non-negotiable and must be met in order to obtain a blue rating.    Further, in order to obtain a purple rating, it is desirable that the offeror have the ability to maintain higher level security eligibilities which may be required in option years of the contract. FACTOR 2:  COST/PRICE.  The second evaluation factor is cost/price.  While the Subfactors A  E of Factor 1, when combined are significantly more important when compared to price, as ratings equalize, price may become a deciding factor.  Phase-in price and  proposed costs and fees for all years shall  be evaluated as the total price proposal (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly un balanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, shall be mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offe r (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  Offorers submitting a proposal shall include a completed copy of the provision 52.213-3 -- Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with its offer.

Interested contractors should supply their name, company name and vehicle license number at least 24 hours in advance of the site visit to the POC in order to gain access to the facility.

The following FAR and DFARS clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition.  The full text version may be viewed at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.

DLAD 52.233-9000-Agency Protests
Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity?s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.
(End of provision)
DLAD 52.233-9001-Disputes; Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).

(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party.

FAR 52.212-2  Evaluation-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition:
(a)  The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.  Proposals shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-price factors.  The following two (2) non-price factors shall be used to evaluate proposals:  Factor 1-Technical capability to transport, repair and make fully functional the Grove RTT-990 truck mounted crane and Factor 2-Past Performance. Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a go/no go basis.  If a proposal has been determined acceptable (go) on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror?s past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable proposal and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its proposal evaluated for the lowest price.
FACTOR 1-Technical capability to transport, repair and make fully functional the Grove RTT-990 truck mounted crane.  The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of the following information demonstrating the contractor?s ability to perform:
  1.  Evidence that the offeror operates an established business with experience in the repair of cranes.
  2. Evidence that the offeror can provide the necessary personnel, equipment and financial resources needed to repair the crane.

FACTOR 2 Past Performance.
By past performance the Government means the offeror?s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror?s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror?s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror?s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely response.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable proposal will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.
In evaluating an offeror?s past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offeror?s proposal and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; Federal, State or Local Governments and/or commercial sources.  The information provided should reflect similar contracts for same or similar type service.
The offeror shall provide:
  1. Past experience for preferably three contracts that the offeror has performed within the past 5 years or is performing for projects similar in scope and size to the one described in the Description of Services to include the following information:
    (a)  Company/division name
    (b)  Project Title
    (c)  Contract number
    (d)  Brief description of the contractual effort
    (e)  Period of Performance
    (f)  Contract Dollar Value
    (g)  Current points of contact (include name, address, phone and fax numbers)
  2. A list of any significant problems encountered for the contracts reported in response to paragraph (1) above.  General examples are:  employees not reporting to work on time and customer complaints, i.e., damaged property.  Include also a brief description of how these problems were handled and remedied.

Interested contractors should supply their name, company name and vehicle license number at least 24 hours in advance of the site visit to the POC in order to gain access to the facility.

Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979."

The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1).
