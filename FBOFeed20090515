<CONTACT>Collette A Grosselin, Contract Administrator, Phone 3106535602, Email collette.grosselin@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC><p>The 61st Contracting Squadron, Los Angeles AFB, CA intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for acquisition for replacing entry doors in Bldg 270 and 271 at Los Angeles AFB, El Segundo, CA. The Government is soliciting for the award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract. This proposed contract is being considered as a set-aside under a small business set-aside program. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 238290. The size standard for NAICS 238290 is $14.0 M. The government is interested in all small businesses including (8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses that are interested in performing this requirement. The government requests interested parties submit a brief description of their company's business size (i.e. annual revenues and employee size), business status (i.e., 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, small business) anticipated teaming arrangements, and a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners. The Government will use this information in determining its small business set-aside decision.
<p>This project consists of replacing the store front doors for Bldg 270 abd 271 because existing doors are difficult to open and close due to wind and internal building pressure with same, similar, or equivalent sliding electric doors. The Contractor will also be responsible to install applicable security equipment for the doors and meet ADA standards and requirements. Doors will have sensors that will open when an individual approaches from either the interior or exterior of the building. The Performance Period for this project is estimated to be one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days after receiving the Notice to Proceed. The magnitude of this project is estimated between $100,000 and $250,000.</p>
<p><br />The evaluation technique to be utilized for the contemplated award of the issued solicitation is Performance Price Trade-Off (PPT). Under PPT, past performance will be evaluated. The Government anticipates the issuance of the Request for Proposal in March 2009 and anticipates a closing in April 2009. The target award date is May 2009.</p>
<p>Interested parties should register online and subscribe to receive procurement announcements related to this solicitation by entering the website at http://www.fbo.gov. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for release of the solicitation package. To be eligible for contract award, offerors must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>EXPRESSION OF INTEREST

The United States Government Farm Service Agency currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Brown County, NE located at 731 East 4th Street, Ainsworth, Nebraska, that will be expiring June 30, 2009. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 3,780 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 3,600 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 5 years. The space must be available for occupancy by July 1, 2009. The delineated area is North bounded by: 8th Street; East bounded by: County Road East of Kracl Equip; South bounded by: South Street; West bounded by: Ultrich Street. 

Other applicable requirements include: 

• Parking: 25 on site paved parking spaces. 

• Others. 

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

• Building name and address and location of the available space within the building. 

• Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced. 

• ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF) to be offered and expected rental rate per OASF, fully serviced. Indicate whether or not the quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvements and state the amount, if any. 

• Date of space availability. 

• Method of rentable space measurement. 

• Building ownership information. 

• Amount of parking available on-site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any). 

• Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building. 

• List of building services provided. 

The Government’s decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.

<SUBJECT>Detection and Analysis of Adverse Events related to Regulated Products in Automated Healthcare Data: Efforts to Develop the Sentinel Initiative
<SOLNBR>FDA-SOL-09-1056109
<CONTACT>Tara R. Hobson, Contract Specialist, Phone 3018279691, Email Tara.Hobson@fda.hhs.gov - Doreen Williams , Team Lead , Phone 301-827-3366, Fax 301-827-7106, Email doreen.williams@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>The FDA intends to issue a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for Detection and Analysis of Adverse Events related to Regulated Products in Automated Healthcare Data: Efforts to Develop the Sentinel Initiative.

The Sentinel Initiative is a response to various calls for developing active surveillance of product safety from the Agency.  In September 2005, the HHS Secretary asked the Agency to expand its current system for monitoring medical product performance and to explore the possibility of working with multiple automated healthcare data systems to augment the Agency’s current capabilities of identifying and evaluating product safety information.  The Secretary recommended that the Agency explore creating a public-private collaboration as a framework for such an effort, leveraging large, automated healthcare databases.

In May 2008, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the FDA Commissioner announced the Sentinel Initiative.  The Sentinel Initiative is a long-term effort by the Agency to create a national electronic system for monitoring product safety.  The system is intended to augment the Agency’s existing postmarket (primarily passive) safety surveillance systems and enable the Agency to actively gather information about the post market safety and performance of its regulated products. 

As currently envisioned, the Sentinel will enable the Agency to capitalize on the capabilities of multiple, existing automated healthcare data systems (e.g. electronic health record systems, administrative claims databases, registries) to augment the Agency’s current surveillance capabilities. Sentinel will enable queries of disparate data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included.  Questions would be sent to appropriate, participating data holders, who in turn would evaluate their data according to existing privacy and security safeguards, and send summary results for Agency review.  
  
The objective of this requirement is to provide the necessary support to facilitate the development of Sentinel and carry out mandates delineated in the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA), including, but not limited to, requirements in Section 905.  This will be carried out via the development of specific tasks, as deemed necessary by the Agency, and outlined below in the Scope of Work.

Scope of Work:

a.      The Offeror shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, services, facilities, and otherwise do all things, necessary for or incident to the performance of the work as described below.  

b.      The scope of this requirement covers all aspects of access to automated healthcare data system(s) for active medical product surveillance; signal detection, signal strengthening, and signal validation methodologies; evaluation of scientific methods; risk communication tools; and other requirements for conducting the specified task orders.  

c.       The Offeror shall specify the methods it will employ in accomplishing the key components of each task order. The Offeror shall demonstrate the ability to do all of the following:

    1)Provide technical expertise in pharmacoepidemiology and biostatistics for identifying, developing, validating, enhancing, and implementing advanced analytical and statistical methods (related to signal detection, signal strengthening, and signal validation) to address the specific issues, challenges, and objectives outlined for each task.  

    2)Access (directly) and utilize data from disparate automated healthcare data systems, including, but not limited to electronic health record systems, administrative claims databases, and registries, primarily for active medical product surveillance. Demonstrate experience with methods for detecting, evaluating, and validating signals in these data.  Additionally, they should have ready access/relationships with other organizations with automated healthcare data, and with the researchers that are intimately familiar with those data, whether or not they have been used for signal detection, signal strengthening, or signal validation before.

           a.  The Offeror shall have continuous direct access to various regularly updated automated healthcare data sources containing patient-level health encounter data from the United States in a platform that protects the integrity of patient records.  The data sources shall be a computerized system able to link each patient to all relevant medical care data including enrollment status, medical product exposure data, and coded medical procedures and outcomes.   The data sources should include, to the extent possible, a broad range of patient populations with regard to demographics and socioeconomic status.  Linkage of this data source to additional information, including vital records, chronic disease and/or cancer registries, birth defect registries, and medical device registries, if available, is also desirable. 

      b.  The data sources shall be sufficient to meet the Agency’s need to access patient-level data describing health encounters and medical product use by individuals over time.  The data sources shall have longitudinal data that shall be capable of following uniquely identifiable individuals over time.

      c.   Demographic information (e.g. age and gender), health history, diagnoses and procedures, and hospitalizations shall be available.  Information on race/ethnicity shall be included where available, accompanied by documentation of the origin of this information.  

       d.   In addition, for each patient these data shall contain prescription drug and biologic utilization information, typically including but not limited to the generic and brand name of the product, manufacturer, strength, dosage form, days supply, all dates dispensed, initial/continuing therapy indicator, quantity dispensed, instructions for use, indication for use and prescriber specialty.   The resources shall employ the use of a generally accepted, granular coding system for drugs and medical products, as well as for diagnoses and procedures.  In addition, the Offeror shall have the ability to determine that the product was dispensed to the patient, rather than just prescribed to the patient.  

       e.  Optimally, medical device utilization by patients would also be captured, either at the device type level (e.g., by using diagnostic or procedural coding) or manufacturer level (e.g., by using registry data or bar code data).  

       f.   Although accessible databases will often not have this information, it optimally will be useful to also capture specific product identification data in addition to brand and generic name, including:  lot number (and model designation for devices); product integrity (e.g. visible damage to product or container closure); expiration date;  whether a sterile product; and, whether a new molecular entity. To evaluate potential interactions, data should additionally be captured when available on over the counter medications, dietary supplements and special diets.

      g.    All patient medical diagnostic information shall be represented in the data sources, including diagnoses and procedures associated with all ambulatory, emergency, chronic or acute care setting visits and their dates, diagnoses and procedures associated with related hospitalizations and their dates, and laboratory tests and results (if available) and their dates.  Other health measures (such as family health history, height, weight, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol use, blood pressure measurements, etc.), are of interest if available, as are results of imaging studies.  

          h.    The Offeror shall have the capability of accessing inpatient medical records for validating coded diagnostic data; access to outpatient medical records is also of interest if available. Patient identifiers would stay behind the firewalls of each data holder and only aggregate information would be shared with the Agency.

        i.     The Offeror shall be responsible for ensuring that the uses of the data are HIPAA-compliant.   The Agency will require no patient-, provider-, or health plan-specific identifiers and any aggregated results provided to the Agency will be provided in a standard format.  All activities performed by the Offeror shall and must comply with standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information and protect the rights of human subjects in research. All analysis of data shall be performed by the data holders in their secure environment without transfer of patient level data.  If FDA deems it necessary to review certain data to protect the public, data holders shall make those data available in compliance with HIPAA for FDA review. 

      j.     All data accessed should be available in a timely fashion so as to be conducive to surveillance.

     k.     All data accessed should be from privately held, non-federal data sources from US patients.  

   3)Develop data identification and access plans that includes the kinds, and availability of, data necessary to complete the specified analytic task and related evaluation. 

   4)Develop surveillance plans and study designs, applying pharmacoepidemiological and biostatistical principles and methods. 

    5)Test data model options and the effects on signal detection, signal strengthening, and signal validation.

    6)Provide demonstrated expertise in implementing standardized data elements in disparate automated healthcare data systems.

   7) Develop and propose a secure communication strategy to support the above analysis and data access needs.  If an IT architecture solution is proposed, the design shall incorporate appropriate privacy, security, and auditing mechanisms.  It would not be intended to interact with any existing Agency IT infrastructure. This secure communication strategy would enable the dissemination of queries and subsequent reporting of results between accessed data sources and authorized users.   The Office of Information Management/ FDA should be informed and consulted on required infrastructure components needed for the long-term support of this work.

   8)Provide regular briefings to the Agency on deliverables and findings, e.g., following proposed approaches to analysis, the findings of conducted analyses, and other tasks, to obtain agency input.  This could include training, as appropriate, on methods and tools employed in carrying out identified tasks.

d.     Examples of tasks of interest that might be awarded under this requirement would include but not be limited to: 

        1)Develop, apply and/or evaluate advanced statistical approaches to safety signal detection, signal strengthening, and signal validation in automated healthcare data sources for regulated products during the postmarketing period.
 
      2)Test data model characteristics pertinent to postmarket safety analysis of automated healthcare data.

      3)Create a secure communication strategy to enable coordination of disparate sources to answer questions related to active medical product surveillance.

The anticipated award type is an IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity) with time and materials for a base year and four option years.  This will be a full and open competition solicitation.  This contract will be awarded on best value.

The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541690-Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services.

All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a federal contract.  The website is http://www.ccr.gov.   This announcement is not a RFQ.

<DESC>Boa Prescription Burn Project,
NEPA Categorical Exclusion Process
A.  Introduction
This performance-based Work Statement defines the effort required to secure professional services to manage an Inter-disciplinary Team (IDT), conduct environmental analysis and public involvement, and prepare a Decision Memo for a project to reduce fire hazard on the San Bernardino National Forest, Front Country Ranger District near Lytle Creek and Keenbrook California. The project will be analyzed using Forest Service Categorical Exclusion FSH 1909.15, 31.2 (6) in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
Background:
The Boa Burn is located in an area classified as Wildland-Urban-Interface by the San Bernardino National Forest. Under the National Fire Plan and the Healthy Forest Initiative, emphasis is placed on reducing the risk of wildfire within the urban interface around communities at risk. The area is 834 acres in size.  
The suppression of low intensity fires  for the past 100 years has resulted in a forest condition where the vegetation is denser, ladder fuels are abundant,  and there are accumulations of woody material. Some parts of the project area are exceeding the carrying capacity resulting in vegetation mortality. In addition, the San Bernardino National Forest has experienced drought in recent years, the effects of which are still evident.  A drought is a natural phenomenon; however, when vegetation density exceeds the carrying capacity, many trees and shrubs are unable to withstand drought conditions.  This leads to plant mortality resulting in the current forest conditions with high levels of fuel loading.   
Project Location
The Boa Prescription Burn Project is located in between the communities of Lytle Creek and Keenbrook in the San Bernardino National Forest, San Bernardino County, California.  The project lies on the Lower Lytle Creek Ridge, on an east facing slope, in T2N, R6W, Sections 11, 14, 23, and 24.  
The solicitation will be available for downloading on this site on or about March 30, 2009.
This will be a cascading set-aside.  The primary set-aside is for HUB Zone businesses.  If a fair and reasonable price is not received, then Service-disabled Veteran-owned Businesses will be considered and if no fair and reasonable prices are received from a Service-disabled Veteran-owned Business, then Small Businesses will be considered.

<DESC>Santa Ana Hazardous Fuels Reduction Project, Environmental Assessment Process
A.  Introduction
This performance-based Work Statement defines the effort required to secure professional services to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) for a hazardous fuels reduction project on the San Bernardino National Forest, Front Country Ranger District, Lytle Creek, California. This project will be performed under the authority of, and must comply with, the Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA).
Background:  
The Santa Ana project area is located in an area classified as Wildland-Urban-Interface by the San Bernardino National Forest.  Under the National Fire Plan and the Healthy Forest Initiative, emphasis is placed on reducing the risk of wildfire within the urban interface around communities at risk. The Front Country Ranger District of the San Bernardino National Forest proposes to redevelop the Santa Ana Fuelbreak. This fuelbreak lies in between the San Bernardino foothill communities of Highland and Mentone to the south, and the Mountain communities of Skyforest, Running Springs, and Arrowbear to the north.  Total population to be protected is 109621 (2005 census data).  Number of Housing units to be protected is 35860 (2005 Census data). 
The current state of the fire break needs repair due to the lack of recent thinning and fires has resulted in a forest condition where the vegetation is denser, ladder fuels are present, and there are unnaturally-high levels of woody material in some parts of the project area. In addition, the San Bernardino National Forest has experienced an extreme drought in recent years, the effects of which are still evident.  A drought is a natural phenomenon; however, when vegetation is unnaturally dense, many trees and shrubs are unable to withstand drought conditions.  This leads to tree and shrub mortality resulting in the current forest conditions with unnaturally high levels of fuel loading. Trees, stressed due to the lack of moisture, are also being killed by insects and diseases.  Countless trees died as a result of drought and drought-related stresses.
Project Location
The project area is located along an existing fuelbreak, which lies between the San Bernardino foothill communities of Highland and Mentone to the south, and the Mountain communities of Skyforest, Running Springs, and Arrowbear to the north.  Fuelbreak parallels Forest Road 1N09 east of Highway 330.  The projects’ legal description is T1N, R1W sections 8, 16,17,18, and T1N, R2W sections 8, 13,14,15,16,17,18, 20, 22, 24 and T1N, R3W sections 10,11,12,13,14. The proposed project study area is approximately 1992 acres. 

The solicitation will be available for downloading on this site on or about March 30, 2009.

This will be a cascading set-aside. The primary set-aside is for HUB Zone businesses. If a fair and reasonable price is not received, then Service-disabled Veteran-owned Businesses will be considered and if no fair and reasonable prices are received from a Service-disabled Veteran-owned Business, then Small Businesses will be considered

<DESC> Security Compliance Posture Monitoring and Reporting (SCPMaR) 

The Department of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires an integrated security compliance posture monitoring and reporting solution that will provide the IRS with the ability to monitor, measure, and manage the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) compliance of its implemented technical security controls, enterprise-wide. Towards this end, the IRS is conducting a full and open competition and will be soliciting requests for proposals (RFP) from eligible vendors who can provide an integrated comprehensive solution that meets the following minimum requirements.

Security posture is defined as: Level of assurance that adequate technical security controls have been implemented to meet the information protection needs, as defined by Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 200, and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53.  Security posture metrics are defined as:
&#61607;	Degree of assurance that the technical security controls and security configurations defined by IRS and NIST have been implemented.
&#61607;	Level of assurance that security patches specified by the IRS Computer Security Incident Response Center (CSIRC) and the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) have been implemented.
&#61607;	Identification of IRS CSIRC/US-CERT-announced security vulnerabilities have been enumerated (e.g., SANS Top 20 and CVE) utilizing the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

Term and Condition – Solution Qualification Criteria

The “solution” – Security Compliance Posture Monitoring & Reporting (SCPMaR) System, must provide the following functional, operational, import/integration and reporting capabilities:

Functional capabilities:
1.	The solution shall monitor and measure the effectiveness of IRS’s implementation of mandated security controls (i.e. security configuration benchmarks) on computing assets, enterprise-wide, and in a timely manner.
2.	The solution shall manage security configurations throughout the system life cycle by assessing and reporting the level of compliance with IRS and US Government standard technical security controls. 
3.	The solution shall use NIST-defined Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP).

Operational capabilities:
4.	The solution shall automate the security compliance assessment and reporting processes to reduce the level of effort in coordination and execution, across the enterprise.
5.	The solution shall facilitate the risk management process by verifying that computing assets operate within the established security configuration baselines and identify risks at the appropriate level of abstraction.
6.	The solution shall support IRS change control processes by assisting the authorized organizations to define and maintain baseline security configurations with risk commensurate deviations throughout the system life cycle.

Import/Integration capabilities:
7.	The solution must integrate with IRS's existing IT computing infrastructure which operates in a geographically diverse environment and consists of approximately:
&#61607;	120,000+ Windows XP desktop workstations and laptops
&#61607;	1,000+ Windows-based servers running Windows 2000 Server 
&#61607;	3,000+ Windows-based servers running Windows 2003 (x-32 and x-64 bit platforms)
&#61607;	1,000+ Unix-based servers running Solaris 8, 9, and 10
&#61607;	300+ UNIX-based servers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5
&#61607;	100+ UNIX-based servers running HP-UX 11 and IBM AIX 5.2

 Most of the servers are located in 3 geographically diverse enterprise computing centers (ECC) and 10 campuses.  The desktop workstations and laptops are located in across 600 post-of-duty stations (PODs) throughout the U.S. and overseas.

8.	For interoperability to existing IRS IT investments, the solution must be able to import or integrate data from existing IRS platforms, systems and tools including but not limited to:
&#61607;	Import a list of identified vulnerabilities generated from ISS Internet Scanner (Version 7.x or most current release) and Nessus (Version 3.x or most current release).
&#61607;	Import a list of required security patches specified by IRS or US-CERT.
&#61607;	Integrate with IRS Directory Service (DS) (i.e., Microsoft Active Directory Service) and IRS Employee User Portal (EUP) (i.e., SiteMinder) for user authentication.
&#61607;	Integrate with NetIQ Group Policy Administrator.
&#61607;	Integrate with Altiris Patch Manager and Sun N1 Patch Manager.

Reporting Capabilities:
9.	The solution must provide FISMA compliance reports in accordance with OMB M-07-19 and Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) compliance report as defined in OMB-M-07-11 using NIST-defined FDCC reporting format.

<DESC>Federal Business Opportunities Draft/ Synopsis


The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Metabolism Branch, plans to procure on a sole source basis services regarding testing of a proposed new anthrax vaccine.

The Metabolism Branch, NCI has developed a safer and more immunogenic vaccine candidate against anthrax by integrating a codon-optimized gene encoding the protective antigen (PA) of Bacillus anthracis into the genome of Dryvax (Wyeth) vaccinia strain and Modified Virus Ankara (MVA) strain of vaccinia virus. The purpose of this procurement is to ascertain the efficacy of this NCI-owned vaccine against an experimental challenge of B. anthracis in a specific rabbit model of disease and it is necessary for the government to correlate immunological findings of the NCI owned vaccine candidate against anthrax with results from other completed studies.  This challenge study will provide critical information as to the immunogenicity, reactogenecity and correlates of immunity for these anthrax vaccines in an appropriate, validated small animal model (Hermanson, G. et al PNAS, 2004, 101: 13601-13606), a required step before a vaccine could be used in people.

It is critical that the facility performing this evaluation is experienced with the complex methodology of procuring and housing rabbits under appropriate conditions for aerosol inoculation with the targeted B. anthracis spore (Ames strain) inhaled dose. The facility performing this testing must be able to provide a validated stock of known lethal dose titrer B. anthracis spores for the aerosol inoculation required and to perform bacteremia evaluations on serum after bleeding the injected rabbits from an auricular artery or vein.
  
This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party has the unique capabilities, resources and personnel to perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on December 18, 2008.  For further information please contact Michael Marino, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at marinomic@mail.nih.gov .   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).   Reference NCI-80064-MM.

The estimated maximum value for all contracts is $50,000,000.   
Proposers will be evaluated using the two-phase request for proposal procedures that result in awards based on best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.
Phase 1 is the pre-qualification phase.  Phase I factors relate to the five year ID/IQ contract requirements for new construction, renovation, alteration, maintenance and repair work, with some design capability.  A maximum of seven firms will be prequalified in Phase I and will participate and advance to Phase II technical solutions and price.  For Phase 1, offerors will be evaluated on the following factors:  Factor 1 - Past Performance and Relevant Project Experience including Subfactor 1A - Design Team and Subfactor 1B - Construction Team; Factor 2 - Technical Qualifications including Subfactor 2A - Design Team and 2B - Construction Team; and Factor 3 - Management Approach including Subfactor 3A - Management Approach, Subfactor 3B -Construction Quality Control and Subfactor 3C - Safety and Experience Modifier Rate (EMR).
In Phase II, the selected Phase I offerors must submit technical and price proposals for the seed project. Offerors who fail to submit their Phase II technical and price proposals will not be considered for award. The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution for the seed project and other factors that define the quality requirements for the seed project.  Offerors claiming professional designation shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline. Price proposals may include total price evaluation or evaluation of scope/design options, within the Government's published budget for award.  Proposers will be required to submit a bid bond for the seed project and for each task order.  The best value offeror will receive a contract for the seed project.  The remaining best value offerors selected will receive a D/B Multiple Award Construction Contract that will include a minimum guarantee of $10,000.  Should one or more of the D/B M! ACC Contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate that task order with only that offeror.
FOLLOW-ON WORK AFER AWARD: The successful offerors awarded a D/B MACC contract in Phase II will compete on future task orders.  Offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract. Participation in the pre-proposal conferences or site visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government. The task order statements of work may be written based on Government/Contractor team cooperative scoping of the work. Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages. Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or lowest price technically acceptable. If the Government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task!  order. 
NOTE:  Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor's Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a DoD contract.  Offerors are further advised that failure to register in the DoD CCR database may render your firm ineligible for award.  Contractors not already registered in CCR are highly encouraged to register.  For more information, see the CCR website at www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolk, Contracting Department,Philadelphia Office intends to procure non-personal, operational and technicalsupport services to integrate a Boeing Scan Eagle Unmanned Aerial Vehicle System(UAVS) into a joint intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR)architecture and execute tasks to support the United States Joint Forces Command(USJFCOM), Joint Transformation Command for Intelligence (JTC-1), JointBattlespace Awareness ISR Integration Capability (JBAIIC) experimentrequirements for Empire Challenge 2009 (EC09).  The EC09 demonstration period is6-31 July 2009.  The anticipated period of performance is 1 July 2009 through 7August 2009.  The proposed action is for services for which the Governmentintends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, The Boeing Company(Boeing), under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The Boeing Scan Eagle UAVS is akey enabler for the USJFCOM-planned EC09 experiments.  With its uniquecombination of EO/IR/SAR sensors, the Scan Eagle UAVS can provide real-timesurveillance through smoke, fog, sand, snow, rain and darkness, augmenting otherISR collection systems, and expanding the range of possible missions a small UAScan accomplish.  Real-time ISR FMV imagery with embedded metadata from theBoeing Scan Eagle UAVS is ideal for the multiple, highly persistent sensingroles required of JBAIIC field experimentation. The Scan Eagle is flexible,expandable, and quickly reconfigurable in the field, (due to the modularitydesigned into its airframe, avionics, ISR payloads, and personal computer (PC)expansion boards); it is the only UAVS of its size to integrate a SAR; and iscurrently deployed in large numbers with U.S. Navy and Marine Corps units toSouthwest Asian combatant theaters; it represents the singular UAVS platformsuitable to facilitate planned JBAIIC experimentation.  In addition, thehardware design of the UAVS with its airframe, avionics, payloads, and PCexpansion boards contains proprietary data available only from Boeing, theoriginal equipment manufacturer.  Boeing is the only known source that canprovide the Scan Eagle UAVS, the technical experience and expertise, theproprietary technical design data, and the qualified personnel necessary tosuccessfully enable the United States Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) to meetmission requirements to plan, coordinate, and execute EC09 experimentationobjectives.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability torespond to the requirement or to submit proposals.  This notice of intent is nota request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider allproposals received within forty-five (45) days after the date of publication ofthis synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposedcontract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within thediscretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be consideredsolely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitiveprocurement.  The Government will not pay for information received.  Based uponmarket research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12,Acquisition of Commercial Items.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NAICS Code: 541620 - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) intends to award additional capacity to Eastern Research Group, Inc. on a sole source basis for the continuation of services under EPA contractEP-W-04-047.  This award is to continue on-going, uncompleted work assignments featuring services including field inspections, soil sample gathering, new source air emissions file reviews, petroleum refineries investigations, chemical risks investigations, and case support preparations on Municipal wastewater treatment plants.   The anticipated additional capacity is 5,870 hours to support on-going, non-severable services under three work assignments under EP-W-04-047.   The period of performance for this procurement will be from date of award through September 30, 2009. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.  It has been determined that Eastern Research Group, Inc. is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirements, as they are the current contract holder working on these non-severable projects that cannot be stopped as they are critical to the success of the Agency's mission.  ERG is the only company with the innate knowledge, experience and personnel to complete the requirements within the Government's schedule. Additionally, it has been determined that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government, as well as unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency's requirements.  A solicitation re-competing EP-W-04-047 is current out for bid, but will not be placed in time to meet the current contract and the above noted work assignments needs.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, which if received within ten (10) calendar days of the date of this announcement will be evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions or comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to Cara Lynch, at lynch.cara@epa.gov.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE.  The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Head Start (OHS), through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Division of Acquisition Management (DAM), intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Zero to Three, 2000 M Street, Northwest Suite 200, Washington, DC 20036, TO EXTEND ITS CURRENT CONTRACT, number HHSP23320042900YC, for six (6) months.  The statutory authority is 10 USC 2304(c), as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

OHS is seeking a six-month extension to its contract for the Early Head Start National Resource Center (EHSNRC) with Zero to Three.  Zero to Three provides technical assistance (TA) and support to more than 700 Early Head Start (EHS) programs across the country serving 62,000 children and families.  As a result of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), 400-600 additional programs will be funded this summer, serving an additional 55,000 children and 10,000 staff.  This funding almost doubles the number of currently funded EHS programs.  Programs must be funded by the end of the summer and into the fall, and services currently provided by Zero to Three must begin immediately.  The Government must award ARRA money quickly, and then work with grantees to ensure full implementation of services shortly after they are awarded funds.  Zero to Three is the only firm with the capacity to complete the tasks that must begin summer 2009.  

As required in the Memorandum on Funding Guidance for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 issued by Executive Office of the President on February 18, 2009, the work must begin immediately.  Zero to Three is prepared to begin this work immediately.  The following activities must take place as soon as grantees are awarded, which is to be no later than September 30, 2009:

1.  Using a variety of means including listservs, teleconferencing, tip sheets, videoconferencing and web based interactive system, set up peer to peer and other communication systems for federal staff, regional and state Training and Technical Assistance (T/TA) providers, and grantees.  During the extension the EHSNRC will need to add all of the newly hired federal staff, TA staff and grantee staff to the existing communication networks that have been established.  They will need to conduct information teleconference calls, and webinars to bring new federal, TA and grantee staff into the various networks. 

2.  Maintain and monitor the toll-free number and phone and email information requests.  The current system will need to be expanded to include new parties. 

3.  Plan and conduct Leadership Seminars.  The OHS must hire additional federal staff to award ARRA funds and monitor the new grantees.  All new, and many of the existing federal staff, must attend the leadership seminars to support their work providing oversight and monitoring to new grantees.  It is the task of the EHSNRC to conduct leadership Seminars.  The contractor will need to conduct these seminars in the fall of 2009.

4.  Plan and conduct National Orientation Conference.  This is an ongoing task of the contract based on funding of new programs.  With the expected funding of 400-600 new EHS programs, the contractor will need to conduct 2-3 national orientation conferences throughout the fall.  It is an OHS requirement that new grantees attend a National Orientation Conference shortly after being awarded EHS funds. 

5.  Develop a tool to assess risk of new grantees.  The contractor will develop a tool based on the current Organization Readiness Chart used by EHSNRC.  It will support the federal staff and the contractor to determine the need for targeted on-site visits to new grantees as well as train other consultants to do that work.  

Zero to Three is uniquely qualified to start the tasks quickly and complete them in the 6 month time period.  Zero to Three has been the contractor for the EHSNRC, since Early Head Start was established in 1995.  Zero to Three trains and supports professionals, policymakers and parents in their efforts to improve the lives of infants and toddlers.  In the initial funding of Early Head Start grantees in 1996, and the expansions in the few years following, Zero to Three took a leadership role in providing services, resources, materials, and training to new grantees.  Early Head Start presented unique challenges to the Head Start community, and Zero to Three’s EHSNRC has provided outstanding leadership and support to the federal government and new grantees.  

Interested concerns may identify their interest and submit a capability statement that demonstrates their ability to provide the services required in the timeframe required.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE; THEREFORE, REQUEST FOR SUCH DOCUMENT WILL BE CONSIDERED INVALID RESPONSES.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days from the date of this synopsis, the Contracting Officer will proceed with the modification.

<DESC><p>Based upon the results of the Justification and Approval notice dated May 6, 2009, The General Services Administration, Public Building Service, Boston Service Center, Boston, MA intends to issue a sole source contract modification in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to extend Contract Number GS-01P-03-BWC-0071, and retain Northern Management, 607 Church Street Sandpoint, ID 83864, for a six (6) month performance period from June 1, 2009 to November 30, 2009. The current contract provides operation and maintenance services for the Frederick C. (FC) Murphy Federal Records Building, 380 Trapelo Road, Waltham, MA 02452. The current contract expires May 31, 2009. The Government is in the process of conducting market research and soliciting the mechanical portion, which includes landscaping and snow removal, of this contract. The process is taking longer than anticipated due to changes in requirements, and interest from NISH. Therefore, this sole source extension is necessary to bridge the gap between the current contract and new award to ensure continuity of services and support the transition to a new competitive award.
<p>The Description of the work to be performed: The Contractor shall be responsible to provide all management, supervision, labor, subcontractors, materials, supplies and equipment, and shall plan, schedule, coordinate, and assure effective completion of all services described within the current contract. The contractor shall be fully responsible for providing all customer service, cleaning, mechanical operations and maintenance, incidental repairs, minor repairs, landscaping and quality control at the FC Murphy Federal Records Center, Waltham, MA. The period of performance will be six (6) months.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C 253 (c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p>This extension is issued to facilitate continuation of services. A lapse in service will have a detrimental effect on the ability of the General Services Administration to provide building services to the Federal Agencies who occupy the FC Murphy Federal Records Center. This extension will provide services without disruption for the operation of facilities of this size and complexity by a firm that is familiar with the equipment and hold current security clearances. Northern Management has been performing these services since 2003 and is fully capable of continuing to perform for the additional 6-month performance period.</p>

<DESC>This competitive combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items is prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Solicitation No. DTRT57-09-Q-80071 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13.5 and FAR Part 12. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32.  The NAICS Code is 922160.  The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order on a competitive basis.  This is a Small Business Set-Aside.  The John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) has a requirement to purchase 280 Fire Extinguishers in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW) below. 
STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)?(BEGIN)
The Volpe Center, wishes to purchase 250 portable fire extinguishers and an additional 30 extinguishers to comply with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 10 for Buildings 1 through 6.  The Contractor shall provide services in accordance with the requirements, schedules, guidance, and information contained or referenced herein for the project listed below:
PROJECT TITLE: PORTABLE FIRE EXTINGUISHERS FOR BUILDINGS 1 THROUGH 6PROJECT LOCATION:  JOHN A. VOLPE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS CENTER CAMBRIDGE, MA. 02142
Government points of contact for this project are:
Mr. Bill Ng, Facility Engineer
A site visit is required and shall be coordinated with Ms. Karen Marino, at (617) 494-2437.
Hours of Operation The Volpe Center is open from 6:30 AM to 3:00 PM Monday through Friday.  These hours constitute normal working hours.  The work shall be performed during normal working hours. Drawings There are no sketches or drawings accompanying this package.  
Scope of Work
The Volpe Center has completed their annual portable fire extinguisher (PFE) inspection.
The Volpe Center is comprised of 6 Buildings:
Building 1 has a total of 123 extinguishersBuilding 2 has a total of 15 extinguishersBuilding 3 has a total of 56 extinguishersBuilding 4 has a total of 29 extinguishersBuilding 5 has a total of 5 extinguishersBuilding 6 has a total of 22 extinguishers
Total 250 portable fire extinguishers (PFE) were inspected.
Upon inspection, 2 ? 10lb ABC extinguishers will require 6 year maintenance, 108 - 10lb ABC extinguishers require hydro testing and refill along with valves and o-rings.  After reviewing the final report, the Volpe Center would need to service the final 140 PFE in the next several years. 
The Volpe Center desires to purchase 250 new PFE rather than servicing the 110 PFE that need service and the140 PFE which will require service in the next few years.  This approach would provide the Volpe Center with a base-line throughout the Volpe Center Campus, thus eliminating the need to swap out PFE every year.  With this approach the Volpe Center will have PFE for the next 6 years, with only inspection every year.  The contractor shall remove all existing PFE at the Volpe Center and install all new PFE with the appropriate inspection certificates.  
The contractor must be able to read the exiting bar code for each PFE and provide a report of its location and present condition.  The existing bar code format is 3 of 9 with a minimum of 8 digits that comprise a unique serial identifier within the Web-based Reporting System.  The report shall be downloadable in rich text format or Microsoft Word.
In addition, the following were recommendations for each Building to comply with NFPA 10.  The Contractor will provide the following additional 30 new PFE with the appropriate inspection certificates and mounting.

<DESC>RECOVERY - MATOC Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Pool of Contractors IDIQ Southwestern Division, Horizontal Construction<BR><BR>Solicitation Notice   This solicitation is issued as a SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS for Design-Build Horizontal Construction Services.  This solicitation will be evaluated under the Design-Build two-phase process utilizing best value trade-off acquisition procedures. <BR><BR>The Galveston District intends to award two or more Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) to SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS, with an estimated workload value of approximately $80,000,000.00 for SWG and SWD customers as follows:  Civil Works, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) mission area.  The contracts will contain a base period plus four one-year options for the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for design-build, design-bid-build and construction services with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $5 million and a minimum task order limitation of $3 thousand.  The minimum guarantee for the unrestricted MATOCs is $3000 and it only applies to the base period. <BR><BR>The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  The solicitation will be a two-phase negotiated acquisition; there will not be a public bid opening.  All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government.  <BR><BR>It is anticipated that the majority of the work will be limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  However, because SWD Services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered, therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical areas as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement.  <BR><BR>Scope of Work:  The MATO contracts are intended for multi-tasking of horizontal construction services for a wide variety of new construction, maintenance, repair, and alteration projects for Civil, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) Projects.

The goal is to provide responsive and cost effective supply chains for each National Stock Number (NSN) with increased component availability and reliability as a complement/alternative to any existing depot or Inventory Control Point (ICP) capabilities already in place.

1.0 SCOPE

1.1 BACKGROUND 

The HEART conference is co-sponsored by the Department of Defense (DoD).  The conference was established jointly by Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) Sandia National Laboratory (SNL) in accordance with a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), dated 9 August 1999, to effectively disseminate classified and sensitive technology development in the areas of radiation vulnerability and hardening, while restricting the information flow to those with appropriate security clearances and a need-to-know.   For over 20 years, the HEART Conference has been one of the world’s preeminent conferences concerned with the effects of both nuclear and space radiation effects on electronics and systems.  The HEART Conference represents the major event for government organizations and their contractors to present the results of their classified research and development activities.  Each year’s conference consists of a tutorial course, oral presentations, and posters sessions presented at the ITAR level with some presentations presented at the SECRET/RD level.  The HEART Conference provides a venue for organizations to report on the results of their research activities in this area to serve as a measure to assess the efficacy of DTRA research.  The topics generally included at the conference are x-ray simulators and testing, EMP and ionizing radiation hardening approaches for systems and components and other issues having to do with nuclear hardening and survivability.             

1.2 OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project is to support the HEART Conference which provides a professionally recognized forum for the presentation and publication of radiation effects research and to distribute research results, not available for general publication, to system developers for support of future military applications.

2.0 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS

	2.1. Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5105.62, DTRA
	2.2. DTRA  Instruction 4500.02
	2.3. HEART Guidelines 

3.0 REQUIREMENTS  

      3.1. Provide the 2009 HEART Conference that will stimulate a professional forum specifically for classified/sensitive research and development investigations in space radiation, nuclear, electromagnetic pulse phenomena, and EMP/HPM effects on systems and subsystems.

       3.2. Provide a unique, classified and export controlled colloquium for authors who desire the professional recognition associated with full refereed publications.

       3.3. Acquire and stimulate papers for publication in the Journal of Radiation Effects: Research and Engineering.

       3.4. Follow the HEART Organization and Guidelines for Operation.

<SUBJECT>Combined Trace and Microbiological Evidence Collector and Separator
<SOLNBR>09-LDQ002021
<RESPDATE>052709
<CONTACT>Lynda M. Theisen, Fax 703-632-8480, Email Lynda.Theisen@ic.fbi.gov
<DESC><p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation issues this sources sought notice to conduct market research for information and planning purposes to determine the existing market capability of potential small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) capable of providing a combined trace and microbiological evidence collector and separator.</p>
<p><br />1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND</span></p>
<p><br />Trace evidence has traditionally been collected from surfaces by vacuum onto the surface of filters. Vacuum collection has also been demonstrated to be effective for microbes can be collected from a large surface area of any texture. The Hazardous Materials Response unit (HMRU) uses the 3M Trace Evidence Vacuum Filter for microbiological collection. However, there are several limitations associated with the use of the filter.</p>
<p><br />Traditional forensic methods for trace evidence collection and microbiological sampling methods are rarely compatible. For example, typical microbiological sampling methods use a swab or wipe tends to obliterate latent fingerprints on the surface. Cutting of vacuum filters and vigorous physical handling of the pieces for microbial evidence collection can result in loss of trace evidence (e.g., hairs and fibers). Examination of the filters for trace evidence prior to extraction of the microbes could be hazardous because the microbes may be pathogenic. In addition, even if trace evidence is found on the filter, the significance of the finding is relevant only after it has been shown that a pathogen has also been trapped by the device.</p>
<p><br />The 3M Trace Evidence Filters also have physical limitations. For example, in dirty environments, the filters become clogged rapidly. Such filters buckle, creating a pathway for dangerous microbes to pass into the vacuum source and possibly into the environment. Clogging limits the amount of evidence that can be collected as well as the area that can be probed. Thus, the field operator, who may be dressed in full personal protective equipment, must change filters often in dirty environments. This process requires more time be spent in a potentially hostile environment and under unpleasantly high body temperatures associated with wearing the PPE.</p>
<p>The HMRU requires a device designed to permit simultaneous trace evidence collection and microbiological sampling into an easily-handled collection tube and with a greater capacity than filter devices. A possible solution is to design a device based on the use of two particle collection technologies placed in series. The device would separate particles larger than about 10 microns in a dry collection cup in a cyclonic separator and smaller, microbe-sized particles in a small volume of liquid in a liquid impinger.</p>
<p><br />2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">OBJECTIVE</span></p>

<DESC>A. General Information:

In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), this request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the announcement. This is a Sources Sought regarding potential sources. 

The intent of this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement is to conduct market research to identify sources to support informed decisions to procure for the required services, i.e., a total small business set-aside action  (e.g., SBA Certified 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned, HUBZone, Small Disadvantaged, Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned,), GSA task order, etc. Our intention is to specifically identify small businesses. This notice is a Request for Information (SOURCES SOUGHT) for all interested qualified small businesses that meet the requirements for this effort.
The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541711 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This is not an invitation for bid, request for quote or other solicitation. 

B. Project Background:

The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) has specific regulatory responsibilities directed at ensuring the safety of food, food additive, dietary supplement, and cosmetic products.  In part, CFSAN maintains an active research program for the purpose of developing and applying technologies to detect, to identify and evaluate microbial hazards that may contaminate products either naturally or intentionally.  

CFSAN has a research project in place to develop methods for the isolation and identification of biothreat agents and conventional pathogens in foods.  The identification methods currently in place will identify a single agent in a food matrix, which is fine if there is intelligence such as clinical cases of infection that suggest the causative agent of the infection.  However, in the event of an unknown with either biothreat or conventional pathogens, separate methods would be needed to screen for all of the microbial agents of concern.   This analysis would require a large amount of time that could result in significant morbidity and mortality.  Using the multiplex approach such as the Luminex (Bio-plex) system multiple agents could be screened for simultaneously significantly reducing analysis time and removal of contaminated products from the US food supply. 

C. Objective: 

The objective of this potential requirement is to assist CFSAN in fulfilling its regulatory responsibilities and guard the American public from intentional or accidental contamination of the food supply with these microbiological agents. 

D. Draft Project Requirements:

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, furnish the necessary personnel, services, and otherwise do all things necessary for, or incident to, the following:

To accomplish the requirements for this requirement the contractor shall have access to both a Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) and a Biosafety Level 3 (BLS-3) laboratory registered with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) select agent program that will enable the contractor to obtain purified DNA from  fully virulent strains of biothreat agents such as Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, Brucella spp., and Burkholderia spp.  The laboratory shall also have access to genetic material from conventional foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serotypes, Cronobacter spp., marine vibrios, Listeria spp., Campylobacter spp., norovirus and hepatitis A virus..  This requires that the laboratory shall have access to strain collections of the above listed pathogens to complete the work required for this requirement. The facility isolating the genetic material  shall have a USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) import permit to receive specific strains of B. anthracis, F. tularensis, Brucella spp., and Burkholderia spp. that the Government may require for use on this requirement.  

The facility shall have a security plan in place to safeguard the data generated from this requirement.  It is highly desirable that at least one person working directly on this requirement has a security clearance at the Secret Level or above. 

The contractor shall have knowledge on the isolation of highly purified DNA from gram-negative and gram-negative bacterial cultures as well as viral cultures.  The facility shall have the capability to conduct studies and develop DNA-based reagents for the Luminex (Bio-plex) system for the identification of bacterial and viral pathogens.  It is highly desirable that the contractor has or is currently developing identification methods for the biothreat using the Bio-plex.  If these methods are not currently available, the contractor shall have capability to develop them rapidly and validate them for high priority biothreat agents and foodborne bacterial and viral agents specified by the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.  It is highly desirable that the contractor be familiar with the Bio-plex reagents developed for the CDC Laboratory Response Network (LRN) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHHS), and have knowledge of the validation requirements for reagents utilized by these agencies.    

The contractor shall work closely with CFSAN throughout this requirement and all services shall be provided in a timely manner
1.	All signatures will be designed using a whole-genome approach such that all available complete genomes of different strains of the target species will be compared using multiple genome alignment programs. 
2.	A consensus alignment using programs such as the Gestalt Workbench developed by Gustavo Glusman will be preformed from the alignments that contain the target sequence conserved among all input genomes.  To establish that the organism-conserved sequences do not occur in any other sequenced microbe, the consensus gestalt is compared against database of microbial organisms.  An algorithm will be used for electronic subtraction of sequences from the consensus gestalt that was not unique to the pathogen targets of interest and the result will be a uniqueness gestalt that is mined for potential signature candidates.  At this stage, a number of constraints specific to the type of assay and/or platform (See Table 2 below) will be imposed on the candidate signatures, further narrowing the signature set.  
3.	A final in-silico screening will be performed to verify that signatures will detect the pathogen targets and not detect any non-pathogen targets.  After automated signature design and electronic screening, a file containing primer/probe sequence information is automatically generated for electronic ordering.

4.	Assay format will be a single TaqMan RT-PCR signature comprised of an unmodified forward primer, an unmodified reverse primer and a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe labeled with a 5´FAM fluorophore and 3´Black Hole Quencher 1.  Assays will be tested on using the appropriate PCR instrumentation.  Use of Cepheid Smart Cycler is highly desirable.
5.	Data from the single signature development will be provided to CFSAN prior to development of the multi-plex assay.
6.	Upon completion of TaqMan signature development, a multiplex panel consisting of multiple signatures per agent that can be used to amplify a single agent or multiple agents in a single sample will be developed. This multiplex will consist of probes with recognition sequences identical to TaqMan signatures developed and coupled through an 18 carbon spacer and a carboxyl moiety to polystyrene fluorescent microbeads or immunomagnetic beads as employed by the Luminex platform.  The forward TaqMan primers will be modified by the addition of a 5’ biotin moiety; the reverse primers will remain unmodified.  Probe and primer recognition sequences will be identical to the corresponding TaqMan signatures.
7.	For the assay protocol, all signatures will be computationally designed with specific constraints on GC-content, melting temperature (TM), and primer-dimer formation (Table 2 above) to enhance multiplex capability.  
8.	A standardized one-step PCR protocol for bacterial agents and a three-step RT-PCR protocol for viruses using a commercially available RT-PCR kit will be developed for the PCR portions of the work.
9.	Endpoint thermal cycling will be followed by gel screening or Multiplex hybridization.  PCR amplification will be conducted using one-step amplification kits for ease of assembly and prevention of cross-contamination encountered with two-step procedures.
10.	Standardized amounts of background, target, and near-neighbor nucleic acids will be used during screening process.  The amount of DNA will be determined for each food matrix in consultation with CFSAN.
11.	Each signature will be analyzed for each of the following characteristics.  The values associated with each will be determined in consultation with CFSAN for each agent and food matrix.
o	Limit of detection
o	Repeatability
o	Specificity
o	Robustness
12.	The Cepheid SmartCycler is the preferred instrumentation for development of TaqMan assays and end-point PCR and RT-PCR for gel and Luminex analysis since this is the instrumentation available in the majority of the ORA, FERN and LRN laboratories.  However, assays developed on instruments such the BioRad iCycler and ABI 7000 96-well plate real-time PCR instruments that can be transferred to the SmartCycler platform are acceptable.  
13.	All reagents for all assays shall be available from commercial vendors.
14.	The  efficacy of the nucleic acid purification extraction and purification process will be assessed using known quantities RNA for the virus assays  (e.g synthetic RNA encapsulated by phage MS-2 capsid protein and used as both an end-to-end assay control and extraction efficiency control) and whole bacterial DNA from a non-related non-human pathogen such as Erwinia herbicola.  Efficiency of extraction will be accessed by TaqMan RT-PCR for RNA and by TaqMan PCR for DNA.

Introduction
This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses, HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.  Your response to this information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.  An organization that is not considered a small business under NAICS code 541712 should not submit a response to this notice.

Background
The NHLBI is seeking a small business with the ability to serve as a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) capable of conducting all aspects (administrative guidance, oversight, and support) of a multi-center Randomized Evaluation of VAD InterVEntion before Inotropic Therapy (REVIVE-IT) feasibility clinical study. 

Purpose and Objective
The purpose of this clinical feasibility study is to explore the potential benefit of mechanical circulatory support therapy using ventricular assist devices (VADs) in functionally-impaired advanced heart failure patients who have not yet developed serious consequences from their disease.  The study will serve to inform a pivotal trial directed at a large and growing patient population for whom VADs could offer substantial benefit beyond current medical therapies.  

Project Requirements
The clinical study to be developed will test the hypothesis that VAD therapy improves both survival and quality of life in those advanced heart failure patients who are neither inotrope-dependent nor exercise-intolerant and have not yet developed serious consequences such as malnourishment, end-organ damage, and immobility.  The recommendations made by the NHLBI Working Group on the Clinical Use of VADs are given below.  

• Study hypothesis: VAD therapy in the proposed patient population will improve functional 
  status at 12 months post-randomization and all cause mortality will be no worse than that in 
  the optimal medical management arm of the study. 

• Patients for the study should be ill enough to potentially experience both functional and
  survival benefits from the therapy without undue risk. 

• The estimated mortality rate for this group should be 20%- 30% at one year. 

• Patient Population Inclusion Criteria includes (1) hospitalization in past 6 months, (2) NYHA
  Class IV or Advanced Class III, (3) maximal evidence-based therapies for 3 months, (4) 
  duration of heart failure of at least a year, and (5) no inotropic support for 30 days prior to 
  enrollment.

• The study should be randomized between VAD and optimal medical management (OMM)
  arms.

• The primary endpoint should be a composite of survival and functional status where the
   improvement in functional status would need to be substantial and assessed through 
   objective metrics.

• Secondary endpoints are safety, secondary functional and physiologic markers, quality of
   life, neurocognition, and cost and cost effectiveness.

• Patients should be followed for at least two years.

• Substantial evidence of acceptable clinical performance is required for VADs to be used in
   the study. 

The DCC is expected to develop the clinical study plan (including specific inclusion/exclusion criteria and rationale, device(s) for the VAD therapy arm of the clinical study, adverse event definitions, and functional, quality of life, and neurocognitive measures), a draft protocol, negotiate and obtain signed contracts/agreements with clinical sites and industry partners. 

Required activities by the DCC include, but are not limited to, (1) finalizing all details of the clinical study to provide evidence for the proposed hypothesis and to assess recruitment and data quality; (2) finalizing the clinical protocol and protocol-related documents (e.g. informed consent form, case report forms, etc.); (3) implementation and conduct of the clinical study in accordance with all Federal requirements; (4) management and oversight of the conduct of the clinical study; (5) providing clinical research support services; (6) providing monitoring and safety oversight; (7) providing site training and support; (8) organizing investigator and DSMB meetings and teleconferences; (9) recruiting and randomizing patients; (10) organizing, conducting, and reimbursing for patient protocol evaluations and tests (including follow-up); and (11) analyzing the data and authoring and submitting papers on the study for publication. 

Anticipated Period of Performance

<DESC><p>Sources sought for information regarding Virtual Reality and other visualization tools
<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is seeking information from companies, educational institutions, research and development laboratories (public and private), or other sources about commercially available systems, government available or near-commercial technologies that may be used for the development of next generation, information immersive operator environments for industry.<br /><br />This request for information is part of an overall strategy to identify, integrate or develop the next generation of certain operation control and training systems for fielding by government and industrial clients.</p>
<p>PNNL is assessing the market to gain information about commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), government off-the-shelf (GOTS) and near commercial software products as well as hardware components specific to development of VR based tools for potential use at or in the development of tools to be used at installations world-wide supporting training and operations of large complex systems.</p>
<p>CAPABILITIES</p>
<p>The following capabilities, in a non-prioritized order, are of specific interest to PNNL: 2d and 3d visualization hardware and software, HCI aids including tracking and gesture recognition hardware and software, visors and feedback systems and related development tools, GIS interfaces, support for real time or near real time refresh of data to the VR environment; support for VR integrated modeling tools, support for recording participant actions for future use, support for intranet and internet hosted collaboration, secure communication technologies as they pertain to multi player VR environments.</p>
<p>PNNL is requesting detailed product literature, to assist in determining the capability of software against specific requirements and future needs. Software vendors are invited to participate initially by providing information about their products. Based on the information provided and market research, selected vendors will be given the opportunity to continue in the assessment process by demonstrating capabilities of their software offering or components as needed to perform a more in-depth assessment of functional capabilities. The demonstration may take place at a vendor site or take the form of use of an evaluation copy of software.</p>
<p>The goal of the assessment is to identify new capabilities and evaluate existing COTS, GOTS and near commercial products against specific functional requirements and future needs. These requirements and scenarios are derived from real-world needs, usability standards, and human factors.</p>
<p>Other evaluation criteria include product maturity, interoperability with other systems and data; maintainability, expandability, standards compliance, certification or evaluation by external bodies, training support, and system costs.</p>
<p>Please send product literature and/or other information to:</p>
<p>Sheena Kanyid at Sheena.kanyid@pnl.gov or PO Box, 999 Richland, WA 99354</p>
<p>Proprietary information will be protected to the greatest extent provided by law.</p>
<p>Please note that this information is being requested for information and planning purposes and does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred with participation in this assessment or in the submission of any information requested. The Government does not intend to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information requested. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION/REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, BUT A MARKET SURVEY TO LOCATE POTENTIAL SOURCES.</p>

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare SystemsCommand (SPAWARSYSCOM), onbehalf of the Joint Program ExecutiveOffice (JPEO) for Joint Tactical RadioSystem (JTRS) Network EnterpriseDomain (NED), is announcing anIndustry Day that serves as a forum fortechnical interchange with vendors ofSRW-capable radios. This synopsis isissued solely to inform vendors of theNED strategy and encourage Industryparticipation in this strategy. It doesnot constitute a Request for Proposal(RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP inthe future. Responses to this synopsisare not offers and do not commit theGovernment to a contract for anysupply or service whatsoever. At thistime, the government is not seekingproposals and will not acceptunsolicited proposals. Respondents areadvised that the Government will notpay for any information oradministrative costs incurred inresponse to this synopsis and that allcosts incurred or associated withresponding to this synopsis will besolely at the interested partysexpense.The Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS)Network Enterprise Domain (NED) hascontracted development of the SoldierRadio Waveform (SRW) NetworkManager (SRWNM), version 1.0+, aproduct that will provide planning,configuration, and monitoringcapabilities for radios that provide SRWnetworking. NED is particularlyinterested in sharing SRWNM 1.0+development plans with radio vendorsutilizing the SRW v1.0c waveform togenerate interest in vendorparticipation in SRWNM 1.0+development, integration, and testing.NED will provide information on SRWNMinterfaces with radios for configurationand monitoring and encourage vendorsto develop SRW-capable radios thatcan interface with SRWNM 1.0+ forplanning, configuration,reconfiguration, and monitoring.SRWNM 1.0+ is expected to beginFunctional Qualification Test (FQT) inJune 2010.NED will fund the SRWNM 1.0+developer to build SRWNM 1.0+interfaces with participating radiovendors who agree to develop theirside of the interface with SRWNM 1.0+at their own expense.  Participatingradio vendors will be expected toprovide necessary information andequipment to NED so that NED canprovide this to the SRWNM 1.0+developer. If the SRWNM 1.0+development contractor opts to offeran SRW-capable radio in this effort,that contractor will be expected toisolate SRWNM development from SRW-radio development to ensureconfidentiality of information providedby other radio vendors.NED believes that this strategy willfoster competition among radiovendors and remove a barrier to entryinto JTRS competition bydemonstrating SRWNM 1.0+ supportfor radios from participating vendors.An Industry Day is planned for Friday,29 May 2009, 11:00 AM  3:00 PM,Pacific Time, at the Admiral Kidd Clubat the Antisubmarine Warfare Base(ASW Base) on North Harbor Blvd, SanDiego, CA.  This day will serve toprovide a more detailed description ofthe SRWNM capabilities, radiointerfaces, and approaches forintegrating SRWNM with vendor radios.After Industry Day, interested partieswill be provided further information onwhere and how to submit theirresponses to the Government.Questions concerning thisannouncement may be directed to Mr.Tom Vinson, Contract Specialist, (619)524-5420, Email:tom.vinson@navy.mil, or Ms. JenniferTsui, Procuring Contracting Officer,(619) 524-6307, Email:jennifer.tsui@navy.mil, Space andNaval Warfare Systems Command,4301 Pacific Highway, San Diego CA92110.

The HaMMER ATD will technically and operationally demonstrate new decontaminant technologies in 2010-12 as part of a larger suite of hazard mitigation technologies.  Technologies with sufficient maturity and military utility will be transitioned to the Joint Program Manager-Decontamination (JPM-Decon) for possible incorporation into the Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS).  The HaMMER ATD provides an excellent opportunity for industry to submit technologies with potential military utility for Government consideration, possible evaluation, and possible incorporation into a new program of record.  <BR><BR>Specifically, the HaMMER ATD is requesting information on: <BR><BR>"	Decontaminants that have an improved effectiveness / performance and a reduced logistics footprint than currently fielded decontaminants. <BR><BR>"	Threat and/or material specific decontaminants that will allow for improved decontamination performance on sorptive, permeable materials, such as elastomers and rubbers, as well as ability to decontaminate Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs), Biological Warfare Agents (BWAs), or Non-Traditional Agents (NTAs).<BR><BR>"	Dial-A Decon approach that provides an integrated system that presents choices of different decontaminants, agent indicators, mixing, and application methods to the Warfighter to adapt to the situation.<BR><BR>Proposed decontaminants will be evaluated for operational relevance and demonstrated utility to meet the Warfighters needs.  The maturity of proposed decontaminants should be at an initial Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 4 (minimum) or could be mature enough to meet a TRL 4 before the HaMMER ATD Early User Assessments (2QFY11).  Note:  By definition, a TRL 4 is the Validation of Basic Application Concepts (Component and/or breadboard in a laboratory environment).  However, if agent test data is not available, simulant/surrogate data can be used if and only if a strong case is presented that outlines the agent characteristics being mimicked  this position must be strengthened by including historic agent to simulant correlation data; modeling studies will also strengthen this approach.  Submitted technologies will also be assessed on their ability for transition.  Specifically:<BR><BR>"	Decontaminants considered for CWAs on rubber, elastomeric, and other sorptive components must be effective enough to perform thorough decontamination on hard to reach locations, and show capability to decontaminate a challenge of 10 g/m2 within 30 minutes or less.  (Decontaminants must also eliminate residual hazards thus reducing the need to remove or destroy rubber components).<BR><BR>"	Decontaminants considered for NTAs must be reliable, safe, effective, fast acting, and have a broad spectrum of material compatibility.  NTA decontaminants should be able to decontaminate a challenge of 10 g/m2 within 30 minutes or less.<BR><BR>"	Decontaminants should be ready to use within 15 minutes and remain effective for mission duration.<BR><BR>"	Decontaminants must not degrade or affect the performance of individual protection equipment (IPE) to a level of unacceptable risk, or present any uncontrolled safety hazards to personnel in appropriate mission oriented protective posture (MOPP).<BR><BR>"	Decontaminants should be compatible and not interfere with all standard fielded detectors (i.e., M8 CW Agent Detector Paper, M9 CW Agent Detector Tape, JCAD, CAM, ACADA) used to evaluate decontamination effectiveness and be safe to operate, transport, store, and maintain throughout its life cycle.<BR><BR>"	Decontaminants should have a shelf life of five years and maintain a pot life of six hours following any necessary mixing.<BR><BR>"	Decontaminants will introduce minimal or no decrement in equipment or electronic or optical component performance and be safe to both personnel and the environment.<BR><BR>"	Dial-A-Decon systems should be able to store, mix, and apply decontaminants or other HaMMER technologies at varying pH, pressure, flow rate, etc., pending the operational need and specific CBWA and NTA threat.<BR><BR>"	Dial-A-Decon systems and decontaminants will be ground, sea, and air transportable.<BR><BR>Requested Information<BR><BR>Please complete the attached questionnaire and provide any supporting data, to include the documents specified below.

<DESC><BR>Request for Information (RFI) for Hazard Mitigation Materiel and Equipment Restoration (HaMMER) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD)  Agent Disclosure / Decontamination Assurance<BR><BR>General Information<BR><BR>Document Type: Request for Information<BR>Solicitation Number:  W911SR-09-R-0029-03<BR>Posted Date: 15 May 2009<BR>Response Date: NLT COB 29 June 2009<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address<BR><BR>US ARMY RDECOM CONTRACTING CTR.  W911SR<BR>EDGEWOOD CONTRACTING DIVISION<BR>ATTN:  CCRD -ED/BLDG E-4455<BR>E-4455 LIETZAN ROAD<BR>ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, MD 21010-5401<BR><BR>Description<BR><BR>The Technical Manager (TM) for the Hazard Mitigation, Materiel and Equipment Restoration (HaMMER) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) is conducting a market survey to identify potential Agent Disclosure / Decontamination Assurance technologies that could benefit the Warfighter by identifying the location of Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents (CBWA), Non-Traditional Agents (NTAs) and Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) / Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs) on military vehicles and equipment.  The HaMMER ATD will technically and operationally demonstrate these technologies in 2010-12 as part of a larger suite of hazard mitigation technologies.  Technologies with sufficient maturity and military utility will be transitioned to the Joint Program Manager-Decontamination (JPM-Decon) for possible incorporation into the Decontamination Family of Systems (DFoS).  The HaMMER ATD provides an excellent opportunity for industry to submit technologies with potential military utility for Government consideration, possible evaluation, and possible incorporation into a new program of record.<BR><BR>Specifically, the HaMMER ATD is requesting information on: <BR><BR>"	Agent Disclosure / Decontamination Assurance technologies with the ability to identify the specific types of Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs) and the locations of CBWA contamination or post-decontamination CBWA residual.<BR><BR>"	The performance of Agent Disclosure / Decontamination Assurance technologies in the presence of field grime (mud, blood, and crud) , other common materials encountered in the field of operations area (e.g., Petroleum Oil, and lubricants (POLs)), or cleaning/decontamination materials/methods.<BR><BR>"	The compatibility of Agent Disclosure / Decontamination Assurance residues as they relate with the application of a protective coating that is designed to seal the contaminated area and protect Warfighters from exposure.<BR><BR>Proposed Agent Disclosure / Decontamination Assurance technologies will be evaluated for operational relevance and demonstrated utility to meet the Warfighters needs.  The maturity of proposed Agent Disclosure / Decontamination Assurance technologies should be at an initial Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 4 (minimum) or could be mature enough to meet a TRL 4 before the HaMMER ATD Early User Assessments (2QFY11).  Note:  By definition, a TRL 4 is the Validation of Basic Application Concepts (Component and/or breadboard in a laboratory environment).  However, if agent test data is not available, simulant/surrogate data can be used if and only if a strong case is presented that outlines the agent characteristics being mimicked  this position must be strengthened by including historic agent to simulant correlation data; modeling studies will also strengthen this approach.  Submitted technologies will also be assessed on their ability for transition.  Specifically:<BR><BR>"	Agent Disclosure technologies must be capable of providing a visible indication of gross contamination when applied to a surface as a stand-alone technology or with a decontaminant.<BR><BR>"	Agent Disclosure technologies must be sensitive enough to indicate contamination levels to that of standard fielded detectors (i.e., M8 CW Agent Detector Paper, M9 CW Agent Detector Tape, JCAD, CAM, ACADA) and be visible by the human eye or detectable/visible by a supporting technology, ideally remaining visible for the length of the decontamination process.<BR><BR>"	Agent Disclosure technologies must minimize false-positive responses to POLs, coating/sealant technologies, exhaust fumes, cleaning compounds/disinfectants, etc.<BR><BR>"	Decontamination Assurance technologies must be capable of providing indication when the decontamination thorough efficacy levels have been achieved.<BR><BR>"	Agent Disclosure / Decontamination Assurance technologies should minimize degradation to military equipment, its electronic and optic components, hazards to both personnel and the environment, and not produce uncontrollable residual hazards during the decontamination process.<BR><BR>"	Agent Disclosure / Decontamination Assurance technologies should be capable of maintaining a shelf life of five years and a pot life of six hours following any necessary mixing.<BR><BR>"	Agent Disclosure / Decontamination Assurance technologies should be compatible and not interfere with all standard fielded detectors (i.e., M8 CW Agent Detector Paper, M9 CW Agent Detector Tape, JCAD, CAM, ACADA).<BR><BR>"	Agent Disclosure / Decontamination Assurance technologies must not degrade or affect the performance of individual protection equipment (IPE) to a level of unacceptable risk, or present any uncontrolled safety hazards to personnel in appropriate mission oriented protective posture (MOPP).<BR><BR>Requested Information<BR><BR>Please complete the attached questionnaire and provide any supporting data, to include the documents specified below.  The questionnaire covers technical performance, compatibility and logistical parameters for the Agent Disclosure / Decontamination Assurance technology.  Documentation provided in response to this RFI (W911SR-09-R-0029-03) will be used to substantiate information provided to the questionnaire.<BR><BR>Mandatory RFI Submission Documents <BR>1.	Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for agent disclosure or decontamination (decon) assurance (AD/DA) material mixed as appropriate and ready to apply<BR>2.	MSDSs for each component of AD/DA material as manufactured and stored<BR>3.	Performance and Efficacy Test Reports/Data to support claims<BR>4.	Commercial Specifications/Standards Documentation to support claims<BR>5.	Vendor Preliminary Assessment of Military Utility (i.e., how will the AD/DA reduce Warfighter risk, labor, time and materials required for decontamination, and how it will increase efficacy, throughput, decrease logistics burden, etc.?)<BR><BR>Point of Contact (POC)<BR><BR>Interested parties shall submit information in response to this RFI to:<BR><BR>US ARMY RDECOM CONTRACTING CTR.

<SOLNBR>CP-09-05-15-01
<RESPDATE>052909
<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Floor Mats by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>7220-00-NIB-0381 Mat-A-Dor, 24x32", Black<br />7220-00-NIB-0382 Mat-A-Dor, 36x72", Black<br />7220-00-NIB-0375 Finger-Tip, 24x32", Black<br />7220-00-NIB-0376 Finger-Tip, 36x72", Black<br />7220-00-NIB-0369 SKILCRAFT-3M Nomad 6050, 3x5, Black<br />7220-00-NIB-0370 SKILCRAFT-3M Nomad 6050, 4x6, Black<br />7220-00-NIB-0372 SKILCRAFT-3M Nomad 6050, 4x6, Gray<br />7220-00-NIB-0377 Scraper, Fore-Runner, 3x5, Gray<br />7220-00-NIB-0378 Scraper, Fore-Runner, 4x6 Gray<br />7220-00-NIB-0383 Eco-Plus Wiper/Scraper, 3x5, Gray<br />7220-00-NIB-0384 Eco-Plus Wiper/Scraper, 4x6, Gray<br />7220-00-NIB-0391 Eco-Step Wiper, 3x5, Gray<br />7220-00-NIB-0392 Eco-Step Wiper, 4x6, Gray<br />7220-00-NIB-0397 Vinyl Ribbed Anti-Fatigue Mat, 2x3, Gray<br />7220-00-NIB-0398 Vinyl Ribbed Anti-Fatigue Mat, 3x5, Gray<br />7220-00-NIB-0399 Industrial Deck Top Anti-Fatigue Mat, 2x3, Black<br />7220-00-NIB-0400 Industrial Deck Top Anti-Fatigue Mat, 3x5, Black<br />7220-00-NIB-0402 Industrial Deck Top Anti-Fatigue Mat, 2x3, Black<br />7220-00-NIB-0403 Industrial Deck Top Anti-Fatigue Mat, 3x5, Black<br />7220-00-NIB-0411 2X3 gray anti-fatigue mat<br />7220-00-NIB-0412 3X5 gray anti-fatigue mat</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the GSA/FAS Southwest Supply Center, Fort Worth, TX.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Floor Mats to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>7220-00-NIB-0381 CWNMASR42BK<br />7220-00-NIB-0382 CWNMAFG62BK<br />7220-00-NIB-0375 CRO FTS432BK<br />7220-00-NIB-0376 CRO FTS672 BLA<br />7220-00-NIB-0369 MMM-17780<br />7220-00-NIB-0370 MMM-17790<br />7220-00-NIB-0372 MMM-26452<br />7220-00-NIB-0377 CWNFN0035GY<br />7220-00-NIB-0378 CWNFN0046GY<br />7220-00-NIB-0383 NA<br />7220-00-NIB-0384 NA<br />7220-00-NIB-0391 MLLEG030504<br />7220-00-NIB-0392 MLLEG040604<br />7220-00-NIB-0397 CWNFJS736GY<br />7220-00-NIB-0398 CWNFL3660GY<br />7220-00-NIB-0399 CWNCD0023DB<br />7220-00-NIB-0400 CWNCD0035DB<br />7220-00-NIB-0402 CWNCD0023YB<br />7220-00-NIB-0403 CWNCD0035YB<br />7220-00-NIB-0411 CRO CU2436 BLA<br />7220-00-NIB-0412 CRO CU3660 BLA</p>
<p><br />In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Floor Mats to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than May 29, 2009 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

All inquires and concerns must be addressed to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Ayana Graham at ayana.graham@navy.mil or call 407-380-4012.  Responses to this notice must be submitted by 19 March 2009.

<DESC>The Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs will be holding an Industry Day from 9:30 a.m. to 12:00 noon on Wednesday, June 10, 2009 in the East Auditorium of the Harry S. Truman Building (2201 C St., N.W., Washington, DC 20520) for vendors who may be interested in the upcoming Global Support Strategy (GSS) for Visa Services program solicitation.  The Department of State GSS contract will provide support services for nonimmigrant and immigrant visa operations at United States consulates and embassies abroad, including but not limited to public inquiry services, appointment services, fee collection services, biometric enrollment services, document delivery services and data collection services.  GSS service providers will perform non-inherently governmental activities associated with consular services and provide data collection and delivery to the United States Government.  In order to be eligible to perform under the GSS contract, the selected GSS prime contractors, including all entities which comprise a joint venture, and the joint venture itself, must possess or be able to obtain a Department of Defense (DoD) Secret facility security clearance (FCL) issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M prior to contract award/performance.  The GSS program will be performed outside the continental United States.

The purpose of this meeting is to exchange preliminary information with industry and to solicit feedback on the Government’s acquisition strategy for this solicitation, which will provide a new GSS to replace the patchwork of existing concession agreements with a performance-based contracting framework, ending the model of “user-pays” arrangements as the means of outsourced support in the field.  For this acquisition, the anticipated NAICS code is 541513.  A GSS Discussion Paper is attached to enhance industry’s understanding of the requirement and to allow interested vendors to email questions to the Government in advance of Industry Day.  Questions will be addressed during Industry Day, however the Government may not respond to all specific questions or comments submitted in response to this announcement or information provided as a result of this announcement.  The deadline for emailed questions is June 3, 2009 at 11:00 a.m. EDT. Send all questions via email to mickaligermj@state.gov.

Industry Day attendance is limited to no more than three individuals per organization.  Participants interested in attending Industry Day must provide the following information for each attendee via mail or by courier/hand delivery to the below address by the registration closing date of June 3, 2009 at 11:00 a.m. EDT:

-	Company name

<p>2. Evaluation Factors of Award in section, 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items of this solicitation</p>
<p>ADDENDA TO 52.212-2</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Set-Aside competitive selection in which competing offeror's past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis of past performance and price; with past performance being approximately equal to price. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, the offeror accedes to the term of this model contract and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and past performance records. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. Initially, offers shall be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item Number or Subcontract Line Item Number to confirm the extended amount for each.</p>
<p>B. Performance confidence assessments will be made using the complete questionnaires, submitted directly to the contracting officer on all offerors and data independently obtained from the government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performance efforts involving limited to design/ layout and installation of furniture that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in the solicitation. Performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none if the lower priced offerors receive a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3,Table 3. See Table below for rating and description ----</p>
<p>TABLE 3- PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS</p>
<p>Rating Description<br />Substantial Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort..<br />Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Limited Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort<br />No Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />Unknown Confidence No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned..</p>
<p>C. In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br /><br />D. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>E. If the lowest price offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated.</p>
<p>F. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the section entitled "Proposal Preparation Instructions". Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse performance is defined as performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.<br /><br />G. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offers. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. If discussions are held, the Offerors will be required to respond to evaluation notices within a short time frame (24 hours or less).</p>

<DESC>Thank you for your continued interest in the Presidential Appointee Leadership Program.  Earlier in the week, we posted amendment 4 indicating that we had postponed the submission date for proposals and would alert you when we were ready to receive them.  GSA did this both to streamline the RFP, which had been amended several times, but also to allow GSA additional time to work out some internal logistics on the RFP.  The new date for proposal submission is now Friday, May 22, 2009 at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  

Please be advised that all future postings for this acquisition of a Presidential Appointee Program originally solicited under Solicitation No. GS-03P-CD-C-0039 can be found at this new location under Federal Acquisition Service, Location - Office of Acquisition Operations, Office of Travel, Motor Vehicles, and Card Services (QMA).  

An amendment to Solicitation No. GS-03P-CD-C-0039 has now posted on Friday, May 15, 2009 that makes changes to the solicitation and re-establishes the new due date for proposals.  The quickest way to find the amendment and the transferred solicitation is to access it through the "Quick Search" bar in the upper right corner of the home page of www.fbo.gov, and type in the new solicitation number (necessary as a result of the transfer), QMAD-RK-090001-N.  

Those firms that have already registered their names on the original Interested Vendors List or Add to Watchlist must re-register their names at the transferred posting site to continue receiving notifications with respect to this solicitation.  

Proposals should be sent no later than May 22, 2009, 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time, to:  U.S. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION, ATTN:  Bid Room, Solicitation No. QMAD-RK-090001-N / Rebecca Koses / 703 605 5606, 301 7th Street SW, Room 1065, Washington DC 20407.

Solicitation Number:  FDA1055151

Response Date: 1 June 2009

DESCRIPTION: THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 13.5.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-32.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541690 for a 100% small business set-aside.  

BACKGROUND:  
The Retail Food Protection Team (RFPT) provides expert technical support to the Agency’s Regional Food Specialists and to federal, state, and local regulatory programs.  This is accomplished through several mechanisms, including the issuance of model codes and interpretative guidance, standardization exercises, and training courses.  Retail Food Protection is a cooperative program that is administratively assisted, in part, by FDA’s participation in the Conference for Food Protection (CFP).  In accordance with an FDA/CFP Memorandum of Understanding, biennial CFP recommendations related to the FDA Model Food Code that are made by the CFP membership of state and local regulatory jurisdictions and the retail food industry are reviewed and responded to by the Agency.  

The Center requires expertise in food safety at the retail level coupled with an intimate understanding of Agency rules, procedures, and policies that relate to retail food establishments.   Specific knowledge and skills that are needed include experience in writing Food Code regulatory language and writing CFP position papers, as well as the ability to network within and outside of, CFSAN for collaboration on retail food topics that are cross-cutting with other CFSAN Office responsibilities.

The work under this contract aligns with the FDA Food Protection Plan initiatives and goals, specifically targeted to the purpose of prevention and a deliverable of broad stakeholder awareness.  

SCOPE OF WORK:  

The work shall be divided into separate tasks:  

(1)  Technical Assistance - for the FDA Food Code and variance requests.  Tasks will involve assuring technical accuracy and writing of interpretations and variance request responses based on the FDA Food Code. This may include converting Agency positions into the interpretation format.   
 
(2)  Conference for Food Protection:  Tasks involve assistance to the RFPT in researching information to provide scientific justification in support of agency positions regarding conference recommendations and then assessing the consistency of this information in language used in the 2009 Food Code.  Agency positions are pertinent talking points for the FDA representatives during Executive Board meetings and CFP Committee conference calls.  Tasks may also include review and comment on CFP committee reports. 

(3)  Interpretations and Opinions:  Tasks will involve assisting the RFPT in developing and effecting interpretations and opinions related to specific Food Code provisions as well as assembling and cataloguing technical reference and historical materials that support these provisions in response to requests by regulatory or retail food personnel.  This may include making ready the existing interpretations and opinions scheduled for inclusion in the new searchable database.  This database is a critical part of assuring consistent compliance from State to State. 

Specific Qualifications & Experience:

The proposed Contractor shall have drafted Food Codes for both state regulatory agency private industry and for a Federal Agency.  Qualified persons shall have trained others in both the technical writing and the scientific justifications and concurrences needed to produce this widely accepted document.  The Contractor shall be intimately familiar with the eight Chapters and seven Annexes of the Food Code and other interpretive guidance documents for retail food.  Contractor shall demonstrate past working relations with a Federal Agency, state agency, consumers and industry regarding food safety issues at the retail and food safety level.  In that same capacity, the Contractor shall have conducted numerous field standardization exercises.  

Contractor shall have participated in the Conference for Food Protection (CFP) and have prepared Position Papers for such conferences.  Contractor shall have working relations (liaison) on behalf of other Federal Agencies (USDA and CDC) to coordinate policy decisions on specific food safety issues.  

A resume is required for the position which measures the qualifications and experience of the proposed contractor detailed in the requirement. A “man year” equates to 1880 hours. One resume is to be provided for the combined labor category as follows:

Technical Writer III (Occupation Code 30463) and Computer Operator V (Occupation Code 14045)

A total of one (1) resume shall be included with your proposal for evaluation.  Resumes shall not be submitted for the labor categories containing zero hours.  Personnel proposed by the offeror will be evaluated for their formal education/training, technical skills and years of experience against the desired qualifications set forth in Attachment A.  All resumes shall be weighted equally for evaluation purposes. Resumes that meet the desired qualifications will be scored in the acceptable range, while those that exceed the desired requirements of education and/or experience will be scored higher."  For instance, if the requirement is for a Bachelor's degree and the proposed person has a Masters degree they would receive extra credit (i.e. Acceptable versus Exceptional).

The resumes will be scored against the following criteria:
1. Formal Education and/or training.
2. General Experience.
3. Specialized Experience.
4. Previous work experience clearly indicates skill and ability to perform in the labor category for which he/she is being proposed.

QUESTIONS DEADLINE: all questions must be received by email (david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov) before 4:30 pm (1630) EST on 25 May 2009.  

Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination.  FOB Destination means the contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. 

The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the base price plus all options to arrive to the total price for the requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise an option line item.
 
Award will be made to the party whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.  The Government may award this contract to other than the lowest price technically acceptable quote.  The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor described to "Meet or Exceed the Requirement," 2) Past Performance and 3) Price.  Technical Capability and Past Performance is significantly more important than price.

A.1. Blanket Purchase Agreement

The Government is obligated under this BPA only to the extent of call(s) placed by authorized individuals against this agreement. The Contractor is cautioned that acceptance of calls from personnel other than those authorized herein, acting within the scope of their delegated authority, may jeopardize payment.

1.1.2 Individuals Authorized to Place Calls/Orders and Dollar Limitations

When placing calls, all individuals authorized to place calls must have an obligating document established. The individuals authorized to place calls/orders under this Agreement, and the limits of their purchase authority, are shown below:


UP TO AUTHORITY ORGANIZATION

US Employees    Up to authorized authority amount                  (219) 937-2009

1.1.4 Multiple awards may result from this solicitation. In addition, an award may be made for grand jury services only, deposition services only, or both.


1.2 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The Department of Justice may award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) resulting from this Request for Quotation.

In general, services performed by Contractor personnel may fall within three (3) risk categories as described below:

High Risk Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for exceptionally serious impact involving duties especially critical to the DOJ or a program mission with broad scope of policy or program authority, such as:


• Policy development or implementation

• Higher-level management assignment

• Independent spokespersons or non-management positions with authority for independent action,

• Significant fiduciary and procurement authority and responsibilities, and 

• IT-computer positions responsible for the planning, and implementation of a computer security program; the direction, planning and design of a computer system, including the hardware and software; or, accessing a system during the operation or maintenance in such a way, with relatively High Risk to cause grave damage or realizing significant personal gain. (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, “Management of Federal Information Resources,” for those computer positions that are High Risk at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a130/a130appendix_iii.html).

• Assistance to policy development and implementation,

• Mid-level management assignments,

• Non-management positions with authority for independent or semi-independent action,

• Delivery of service positions that demand public confidence or trust,

• IT-computer positions of a lesser degree of risk that required for High Risk positions (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, “Management of Federal Information Resources,” for those computer positions that are other than High Risk.).

Low Risk (Non-sensitive) - Are those non-sensitive positions that do not fall into any of the above categories and include those positions with potential for impact involving duties of limited relation to the DOJ mission.

4.7.2.3 Types and Numbers of Background Investigations

Work performed under this BPA will fall within one or more of the risk categories defined paragraph 4.7.2.2.

4.7.2.4 Pre-Appointment Background Investigations and Waivers

Background investigations must be conducted and favorably adjudicated for each contract employee prior to commencing work on this task order. However, where programmatic needs do not permit the Government to wait for completion of the entire background investigation, the SPM, in consultation with the COTR, can grant a pre-appointment background investigation waiver. The extent of the background investigation and/or the information needed to waive the background investigation will vary depending upon the Risk Category associated with each position. A waiver will be revoked if the resulting investigation uncovers derogatory information that cannot be resolved in the contract employee’s favor. When derogatory information has been discovered that cannot be resolved in the contract employee’s favor, the employee should be removed from the contract. Minimum pre-appointment investigative requirements are listed below. 

High Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be an LBI (Limited Background Investigation) consisting of a personal subject interview, NAC, credit history check, written inquiries and record searches covering 5 years, and personal interviews covering specific areas during the most recent 3 years. Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a successful National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check, vouchering of previous 2 employers and a favorable review of forms submitted.

Moderate Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be a NACI (National Agency Check and Inquiries) consisting of a NAC, written inquiries, and record searches covering specific areas of a subject’s background during the past 5 years. Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a favorable NCIC check and a favorable review of forms submitted.

If the Contractor determines that employing an applicant will not promote the efficiency of this BPA, the applicant must be disqualified from assignment on the BPA. In this regard, the Contractor shall be responsible for performing the following pre-screening and investigative duties for all persons proposed for work under this BPA:

The COTR should determine if the Contractor is registered in the NISP, then the facility clearance level held by the Contractor, and if individuals selected to work for the Department were previously investigated in accordance with NISP procedures. If an individual selected to work for the Department was previously investigated within the last 12 months, the COTR will obtain a copy of the Letter of Consent (LOC) issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). 

4.7.2.8 Factors for Suitability Determinations. The Department of Justice uses several basic factors in making suitability determinations for contract employees. This information is intended as a guide for the Contractor during their screening process and is not inclusive of all disqualifying situations.

Disqualifying Factors The following conduct factors, as disclosed on the SF-85P and the SF-85P-S, in a written statement or personal interview with the applicant, or established during a reference check may disqualify an applicant from employment on a DOJ contract. Contractors should be aware such individuals may not be able to work for the Department under the BPA.

Criminal Behavior (e.g., a conviction resulting from a serious felony -- murder, rape, armed robbery, etc. -- regardless of when the conviction occurred; a felony conviction, notwithstanding the severity of the crime, within the previous seven (7) years; a period of incarceration as a result of a felony conviction within the previous seven (7) years; or pending indictments or criminal charges)

Infamous or disgraceful conduct (e.g., sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted, or bizarre behavior indicating depravity)

Improper or illegal involvement with drugs within the past 7 years.

Current and continuing alcohol abuse

Intentional false statement, deception, fraud in appointment (e.g., altering the condition of discharge on military discharge documents, altering college transcripts, falsely completing the SF-85P or SF-85P-S, etc.)

Financial considerations (e.g., deceptive or illegal financial practices; continuing inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; financial problems linked to such dependencies on alcohol, drugs, gambling, etc.)

Non-U.S. Citizenship (e.g. non-legal residents; recent legal residents, residing in the U.S. less than four years; non-U.S. citizens maintaining citizenship in "hostile" countries)

Questionable Allegiance to the United States (e.g., membership in organizations or association with individuals advocating violence or overthrow of the U.S. government or involvement in any act of sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition)

Emotional, mental, and personality disorders (when a credentialed mental health professional acceptable to the government has determined that the individual has a condition or treatment that may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability or stability or could physically harm him/herself or others)

Previous security violations (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of classified information or deliberate or multiple violations)

Misuse of information technology systems (e.g. illegal or unauthorized entry into or illegal, unauthorized, or improper use of an information technology system) 

Foreign Influence (e.g. when an individual’s immediate family, including co-habitants and other who the individual is bound by close ties or affection, is not a U.S. citizen and may be subject to coercion and/or duress)

Foreign Preference (e.g. and individual’s behavior indicates a preference for a foreign country over the United States)

4.7.2.9 Mitigating Factors When questionable conduct is disclosed, the following factors should be considered as to whether or not disqualification of an individual for work in the Department is warranted. The decision is made on a case-by-case basis, and is subject to review by the assigned Security Officer, in consultation with the COTR.

(a) The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct.

(b) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation.

(c) The frequency and recency of the conduct.

(d) The individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct.

(e) The voluntaries of participation.

(f) The presence or absence of rehabilitation, resolution, and other pertinent behavioral 
changes.

(g) The motivation for the conduct.

(h) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress.

(i) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

4.7.2.10 Given the above guidelines for determining suitability, the Contractor should be able to determine, without DOJ involvement, which applicants are unsuitable for employment under this contract. However, additional questions and requests for information may result from review of the security packages by DOJ personnel. In the event the Department or the contractor has reasonable cause to believe that an employee under the BPA falls under any of the eleven mandatory disqualification factors listed above, the employee must be removed from this BPA. In addition, all contract employees are expected to adhere to the Department's Standards of Conduct.

4.7.2.11 The COTR will notify the Contractor of the results of background investigations as they are completed and adjudicated. The COTR will also notify the Contractor of any applicants who are found ineligible for employment under this contract so that the Contractor can immediately recruit and initiate paperwork to clear replacement applicants. If a contract employee is already working on the BPA and is determined to be ineligible, he or she will be removed from the call order.

4.7.212 The COTR will notify the Contracting Officer when a sufficient number of Contractor employees have received employment security approvals or pre-appointment waivers approvals. Upon receipt of this information and any other information, which may be required elsewhere in the BPA, the Contracting Officer will issue the Contractor a Notice to Proceed, which permits the commencement of work under the call(s).

4.7.2.13 The Contractor shall ensure no contract or subcontract employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of a written authorization from the Contracting Officer.

4.7.2.14 The Contractor shall make every effort to preclude incurrence of costs by the Government for security investigations for replacement of employees, and in so doing shall ensure otherwise satisfactory and physically able employees assigned hereunder remain in contract performance for at least one year. The Contractor shall take all necessary steps to assure contract or subcontract personnel selected for assignment to this contract are professionally qualified and personally reliable, of reputable background and sound character, and meet all other requirements stipulated herein. The fact the Government performs security investigations shall not in any manner relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to ensure that all personnel furnished are reliable and of reputable background and sound character. Should a security investigation conducted by the Government render ineligible a Contractor-furnished employee, the Contracting Officer will investigate the cause and determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibility to make every effort to select reliable employees of reputable background and sound character. Should there be a need to replace a contract or subcontract employee due to non-performance, the Contracting Officer will determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibilities to make every effort to select trained and experienced employees.

4.7.2.15 Should the Contracting Officer determine the Contractor has failed to comply with the terms of paragraph above, the Contractor may be held monetarily responsible, at a minimum, for all reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the Government to (a) provide coverage (performance) through assignment of individuals employed by the Government or third parties in those cases where absence of contract personnel would cause either a security threat or DOJ program disruption, and (b) conduct security investigations in excess of those which would otherwise be required. 

4.7.2.16 Nothing in this clause shall require the Contractor to bear costs involved in the conduct of security investigations for replacement of an employee who becomes deceased or severely ill for a long period of time.

4.7.2.17 Under no circumstances shall the Contractor fail to comply with the terms and conditions set forth herein without assuming liability for such failure as may be established pursuant to this clause. The rights and remedies conferred upon the Government by this clause are in addition to all and other rights and remedies specified elsewhere in this contract or established by law.

4.7.3 Protection of Grand Jury Information

4.7.3.1 Grand jury testimony is sensitive Limited Official Use information, which must be protected against disclosure to unauthorized personnel. Pursuant to Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures, disclosures of matters occurring before the grand jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made available to the attorneys for the Government to use in the performance of their duties. Otherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter, stenographer, or operator of a recorded testimony may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the court.

4.7.3.2 It shall be the duty of the Official Reporter to safeguard all materials relating to grand jury hearings, which are in his/her possession and/or under his/her custody. The USA may at his/her discretion retain custody of the material, including notes, tapes, drafts, etc., and require all transcribing and typing of the grand jury information be done within the USAO.

4.7.3.3 The Contractor shall hold inviolate and in the strictest confidence any and all information of an official character which he/she may gain in the performance of his/her duties under this agreement. The Contractor shall not divulge, sell, or distribute any information gained at a grand jury proceeding, except as authorized by the presiding official. 

4.7.4 Contractor Physical Security Requirements

4.7.4.1 Contractor employees assigned to work areas where Grand Jury information is processed, stored, or transcribed must challenge the presence of any unknown or unauthorized person. The need-to-know principle shall be adhered to at all times within the closed area. When the materials are not stored in security containers or vaults, and when in actual use by authorized personnel, they shall be protected as follows: 
o Kept under constant surveillance by an authorized person who is in a physical position to exercise direct security controls over the material. 
o Covered, turned face down, placed in storage containers, or otherwise protected when unauthorized persons are present. 
o The room containing the materials must be locked when vacated for short periods of time. 
o Returned to storage containers as soon as practicable after use. Grand jury material shall not be removed from the premises of the court reporter for transcription except for delivery to the USAOs. Approved storage containers include: the GSA Class 6 security container; a lock-bar file cabinet (with a GSA approved lock); or 3-position dial safe. 

4.7.4.2 An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) must be installed connected to a central station at the Contractor’s facility or the facility of a subcontractor who monitor the IDS and guard or law enforcement response to the Grand Jury processing area must occur within 15 minutes of alarm activation. Central station burglar alarm systems classified by the Underwriter’s Laboratories, Inc. or other systems with built-in auxiliary power for fail safe protection, shall satisfy this requirement. (Such system shall not use shunt switches to shut off control panels and all alarm sensors and control boxes should be equipped with tamper-proof switches). A direct-connect or remote station alarm system (i.e., a system connected by direct wire to alarm receiving equipment located in a local police department headquarters, which is activated and deactivated by the using Contractor and responded to by personnel of the local police department) may be utilized. If the contracting firm is housed in a building with a 24 hour guard service, the IDS requirement may be waived. The representative of the Contractor shall be required to report immediately to the facility to ascertain the nature of the alarm and to take appropriate measures to ensure the security of area concerned. 

4.7.4.3 End-of-day security checks shall be performed within the contract facility to ensure that precautions are taken to protect grand jury material. The court reporter firm shall designate an individual or individuals, to make daily checks to ensure all grand jury material has been properly stored. This can be the Grand Jury Court Reporter personnel, or another individual who has been granted security approval by the EOUSA SPS.

4.7.4.4 The Contracting Officer or his/her authorized representative, of the USAO, shall have the right to inspect at reasonable intervals, but at least annually, the procedures, equipment, and facilities used by the Contractor to comply with these requirements.

4.7.4.5 If the contractor is unable to provide the required physical security in his/her workplace, a work area and storage space for Grand Jury transcript processing will be provided at the USAO.

4.7.5 Information Technology

4.7.5.1 Information Technology Equipment refers to computers, steno machines, transcription devices, printers, scanners, and all other technological devices used to electronically process grand jury information for the USAO.

4.7.5.2 When grand jury court reporters process grand jury information outside the USAO while utilizing Information Technology equipment that is not the property of the USAO, the equipment will be used in a dedicated, stand-alone, single user mode (no network capability). The information must be unclassified. All processing must be done on removable storage media (floppy disks, CDs, removable hard drives, cartridges). Removable storage media must be marked "Grand Jury Information." When marking the media, no acronyms should be used. 

4.7.5.3 In addition, any Information Technology equipment used to process USAO information may be subject to certification/accreditation and/or disk-based sanitization to protect grand jury information. As a general rule, grand jury court reporters may not use personally-owned PCs and equipment to process grand jury information. Personally-owned PCs and equipment are those devices the grand jury court reporter uses to conduct personal projects related to obligations, affairs, assets, or life of the operator.

4.7.5.4 When grand jury court reporter owned PCs are used, and/or have fixed hard drives, and the PC is also used for transcription work outside of the USAO, the equipment must have the ability to download to USAO equipment or storage media. In addition, temporary files must be deleted from the grand jury court reporter’s equipment using the currently approved USAO sanitization method. 

4.7.5.5 Access to information technology equipment must be controlled and restricted to personnel authorized to handle grand jury information and having appropriate access approval. Unauthorized personnel must not be permitted to view any grand jury information. The equipment must be turned off, or otherwise disabled, when not in use.

4.7.5.6 The removable media must be stored in an approved security container or lockable file cabinet (in accordance with 6.C.1) after normal working hours or when the equipment is not in use. 

4.7.5.7 All printed output material must be protected. USAO personnel must ensure this requirement is adhered to and documented in the Grand Jury Inspection Reports. 

4.7.5.8 Only appropriately-cleared maintenance personnel escorted and monitored by USAO personnel or court reporter service personnel are allowed to perform on-site maintenance for the equipment. The USAO must grant approval before maintenance of the PC is allowed. The storage media must be removed from the PC prior to removal of the PC from the area for maintenance. 

4.7.5.9 Grand jury information should be backed up on a weekly basis. Grand jury information may not be processed by individuals outside of those contracted and granted security approval. 

4.7.6 Security of Systems and Data, Including Personally Identifiable Data.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2) 
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to:
(A) Change the name in the CCR database; 
(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;
(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor’s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

SECTION D. ATTACHMENTS

D.1 Contractor Residency Requirement Information


All Contractor employees assigned to this contract and working within the United States shall meet the DOJ Residency Requirement. The Residency Requirement states that, for three of the five years immediately prior to applying for a position, the individual must have: 1) resided in the United States; 2) worked for the United States overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or 3) be a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.

This requirement can be waived for short-term (i.e., those employees performing duties for a cumulative total of 14 days or less) if there is a critical need for their specialized or unique skills (for example, interpreters for rare foreign languages). These individuals must be United States citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens. A waiver request from the head of the Component outlining the extenuating circumstances along with the requisite Contractor clearance package shall be submitted through the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) to the Department Security Officer (DSO) for approval. Each waiver request will be reviewed by the DSO and a determination made on a case-by-case basis.

Additionally, a Contractor employee who is not a U.S. citizen must be from a country allied with the United States. Since the countries on the Allied Countries List are subject to change, the head of the Component shall review the following website for current information: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/Citizen.htm.


D. 2 Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza or other National Emergency 

Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza
or other National Emergency

During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation. 

The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: 

• Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. 

• Contractors should cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. 

• Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency. 

• Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. 

• Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. 

• Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. 

• With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Contract Security requirements must be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees’ personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. 

• Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. 

• Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.

• Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. 

• Identify how time and attendance will be maintained. 

It is the contractor’s responsibility to advise the government contracting officer or COTR if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the contracting officer, COTR or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractors notification.

Canadian or Israeli End Products:
Line Item No.:	Country of Origin:
  	  
  	  
  	  
[List as necessary]
(4) Trade Agreements Certificate. (Applies only if the clause at FAR 52.225-5, Trade Agreements, is included in this solicitation.)
(i) The offeror certifies that each end product, except those listed in paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this provision, is a U.S.-made or designated country end product as defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled “Trade Agreements.”
(ii) The offeror shall list as other end products those end products that are not U.S.-made or designated country end products.
Other End Products
Line Item No.:	Country of Origin:
  	  
  	  
  	  
[List as necessary]
(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.
(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--
(1) * Are, * are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) * Have, * have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and
(3) * Are, * are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
(4) * Have, *have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]
(1) Listed End Product
Listed End Product:	Listed Countries of Origin:

(2) [ ] Outside the United States.
(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]
(1) [ ] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that—
(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies—
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
(l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)
(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror’s relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards as a result of this RFQ while also reserving the right to limit awards when it determines that a desired competency has been satisfied. The Government also reserves the right to limit awards to one contract award per industry sector (for example: trade finance or international shipping and logistics). Because this solicitation may result in multiple awards and partnerships of differing natures, selected partners may be incorporated into selected CS programs at anytime following selection, subject to considerations such as the value of partner's offerings to CS customers and clients, ease and cost of integration, compatibility of partner's offerings with CS capabilities and brand, and others.

The OSO has operational responsibility for the Satellite Operations Control Center (SOCC) at Suitland, MD and Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) facilities at Wallops, VA and Fairbanks, AK to command and control the satellites, to track the satellites, and to acquire their data.<br />A primary component in the NOAA satellite fleet is the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series. The GOES satellites provide the kind of continuous monitoring necessary for intensive data analysis. They circle the Earth in a geosynchronous orbit, which means they orbit the equatorial plane of the Earth at a speed matching the Earth's rotation. This allows them to hover continuously over one position on the surface. The geosynchronous plane is about 35,800 km (22,300 miles) above the Earth, high enough to allow the satellites, a full-disc view of the Earth. Because they stay above a fixed spot on the surface, they provide a constant vigil for the atmospheric "triggers" for severe weather conditions such as tornadoes, flash floods, hail storms, and hurricanes. When these conditions develop the GOES satellites are able to monitor storm development and track their movements.<br />The Wallops CDA Station makes use of Nexcom, Inc. Transmitters to support the commanding of the GOES series. To facilitate the remote control and monitor functionality of the Nexcom transmit systems, Wallops requires a Nexcom Transmitter Control Subsystem. Wallops currently uses six of these transmit subsystems to enable the remote control of Nexcom transmitters, in six other GOES antennas. These transmit subsystems make use of proprietary software to control and monitor the operation of the Nexcom transmitters. Wallops has a requirement to provide remote control to a Nexcom transmitter for the recently refurbished 8 meter antenna system. Implementing a different transmitter control system is impractical and would require additional cost for software development, programming, and testing with no certainty of their successful integration with the Nexcom Transmitter.</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

HSAR 3052.209-70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES         (JUN 2006) 

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.     (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>Question #1 Section 3 Cabinetry/Cabinet: Do you have a layout drawing or design on the cabinet. It appears to be a “single drawer weapons locker”, but discusses adjustable shelves, vertical dividers and doors.  

In regards to the Section 3, there is an attached drawing. The items identified (shelving, doors, etc.) is a generic description scope of work, this will not apply to these units.  However, dividers will be part of the drawer system to provide the handler options.

Question #2 Will the chassis be delivered?

It is NOW requested that the contractor provide a cost estimate to pick up these units at our warehouse in Sterling, Virginia via trucking company and drop ship via trucking company two units at Glynco Ga., one unit at Dallas, Texas, and one unit at Sterling Virginia. Complete address will be provided upon award of the contract. This is a change to the original statement of work.

Question #3  Can you clarify the layout?

It is a basic layout as far as a police package goes.  It states in the scope of work plans need to be submitted for all electrical, cabinetry, and console before work will begin.  This means that the contractor will have to provide proof of their knowledge of law enforcement vehicles and be able to work closely with ATF before any work is to begin.

<DESC><p>Combined Synopsis/Solicitation Amendment #1<br />RFQ09-LDQ001996
<p>The purpose of this amendment is to 1) respond to questions received prior to the cutoff date listed in the notice; 2) supplement technical specifications to include changes, additions, and clarifications in response to the questions.</p>
<p>1. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p>
<p>Q1) Is this specification the full supply requirement? The reason why we ask is that typically govt bids are a mass of paperwork and this seems unusually concise.</p>
<p>A1) For the vendor that is awarded the purchase order, several security forms will need to be completed by all involved in the installation process in advance of delivery. Please carefully read each paragraph, particularly to the security and calibration requirements.</p>
<p>Q2) Could you please clarify the difference between "Total Crosshead Travel" and "Total Vertical Test Space"? Our current interpretation is that the Crosshead travel is the total available movement of the crosshead when the load cell is attached to the frame, with the Vertical Test Space being without the load cell attached.</p>
<p>A2) The interpretation intended is that the Crosshead travel is the total available movement of the crosshead when the load cell is attached to the frame, with the Vertical Test Space being without the load cell attached. Total vertical test space minimum has changed from 48" minimum to 47" minimum. Change has been incorporated in the supplemental technical specification within Section 2 of this amendment.</p>
<p>Q3) Can you please confirm that the requirements for the "Cord/wire/yarn grip fixture" are technically correct in terms of capacity and diameter of cords? If correct please confirm the cord materials that you look to test. It is our feeling that there is somewhat of a miss-match here. Either the specimen sizes will not be anywhere near 1.5" diameter or the load will be significantly more than 1,000 lbs. It would be our expectation that a cord of 1.5" could be reach tens of thousands of pounds depending on material.</p>
<p>A3) The cord, wire, yarn grip fixture should be set to the 1,000lb capacity or higher, accommodating 0.1 to 0.5 inch cord diameters. Change has been incorporated in the supplemental technical specification within Section 2 of this amendment.<br />.<br />Q4) Could you please confirm what you require in terms of "Installation"? For example, if we provide foundation and power requirements to you will you be able to provide this? We are trying to establish how much that our technician will be required to perform. Typically our customers connect power to the machine and fix the machine to any foundations we recommend to the customer. The Technician would then visit on site to calibrate and issue any A2LA certification.</p>
<p>A4) The FBI requires complete installation, including delivery of the instrument to the building, unpacking, trash removal, and any rigging required. The FBI will have installed any preliminary facilities requirements (power, foundation, etc.) that are indicated by the vendor.</p>
<p>Q5) To what criteria do you need the machine to be calibrated? We can offer A2LA certification for force, speed, specimen alignment, position, auxiliary extensometers etc.</p>
<p>A5) The FBI Laboratory equipment must be consistent with the ASCLDLAB (American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors/Laboratory Accreditation Board) accreditation requirements. Instruments must be calibrated by an ISO17025 accredited calibration laboratory with standards traceable to NIST. Addition has been incorporated in the supplemental technical specification within Section 2 of this amendment.<br /><br />Q6) Please confirm what you define as a "Fasten Grip"? If possible also confirm the materials and specimen shapes that you expect to test with this item.</p>
<p>A6) Fastener grip set with set of inserts - 20,000 lb capacity; for 1/4", 5/16", 3/8", 5/16", 1/2" diameters. The specifications were not written with any particular brand in mind; however, as an example, Materials Testing Technology Co., Model ASTM.A0185.20 is similar to what is requested with regards to the fastener grips and inserts. Adapters must be supplied to use these grips with the 20,000 lb load cell.</p>
<p>This RFQ is not being converted to a "brand name or equal" request. Any manufacturer who can meet all of the requirements will be considered. Clarification has been incorporated in the supplemental technical specification within Section 2 of this amendment.</p>
<p>Q7) Can you please confirm your definition of "Response Date" &amp; "Archive Date"? We are ultimately trying to establish the closing date that our quotation must be submitted by.</p>
<p>A7) The Response Date is the closing date. All questions must be submitted via email to Dina.Olibah@ic.fbi.gov by May 18, 2009 10AM Eastern. All QUOTES must be submitted by May 29, 2009 by 10AM Eastern via email. Quotes will not be accepted after May 29, 2009 10AM Eastern time.</p>
<p>The Archive Date is the date on FedBizOpps that the combo synopsis/solicitation will be removed from the active site to the archived site. It is an administrative matter.<br /><br />Q8) There is no capacity listed for the Wedge grips. Would they be 20kip to match the load of the frame?</p>
<p>A8) Yes, the load frame is a 20,000lb capacity therefore the wedge grips would be 20kip. Addition has been incorporated in the supplemental technical specification within Section 2 of this amendment.</p>
<p><br />Q9) What would be the maximum load for the compression platens?</p>
<p>A9) 20,000 lb</p>
<p><br />Q10) Which load cells would they need to attach to?</p>
<p>A10) 20,000 lb</p>
<p><br />Q11) With regard to the extensometer, our 1" Gage length extensometers come with different travels, either 10%, 50% or 100%. Which one is required?</p>
<p>A11) The extensometer must be able to be calibrated to 50% extension. Addition has been incorporated in the supplemental technical specification within Section 2 of this amendment.</p>
<p>Q12) Finally, the RFQ calls for "hardware" to be included, but oftentimes in secure facilities outside PC's are not allowed. Our equipment is controlled by PC, so would the FBI provide this piece or would it be part of the bid?</p>
<p>A12) Any machine control hardware required must be included in the bid, whether PC based or not. PC's must have any wireless capability disabled.

<DESC>Subject: Laboratory Case Model Validation

Solicitation Number:  FDA1056086

Response Date: 21 May 2009

DESCRIPTION:

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 13.5.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-32.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541712 for a 100% small business set-aside.  

The FDA intends to issue a firm fixed-price purchase order for the following laboratory case model validation. 

Summary: 
Validation of the Magneto Hydro Dynamic (MHD) simulation platform for the study of MHD induced signals during MRI scans (already developed) and investigation of the MHD effect by simulations and measurements. This work is mainly based on the Virtual Family male model (with revised aorta and vena cava model) and the corresponding MRI measurements. 

Background: 
The overall research objective is to investigate and characterize an electromagnetic biomarker for heart failure (HF) and recovery. The goal is to develop a method to non-invasively characterize cardiac dynamics, including stroke volume and cardiac output. The research will assess information about blood flow that can supplement present non-invasive ultrasound techniques for the evaluation of heart failure. The new physiological biomarker that will be evaluated is the MHD signal recorded on the electrocardiograom (ECG) while the subject is in the strong static magnetic field of a magnetic resonance imager (MRI). This MHD signal is caused by blood flow in the magnetic field. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the MHD signal is capable of the rapid and non-invasive flow measurements that are necessary for evaluating HF, particularly diastolic HF. Such signals have been collected in both animals and humans by other investigators. Analysis of the MHD signal recorded with the 12-lead ECG in conjunction with physiological measurements will require electromagnetic modeling to determine the sources of the signals (i.e., ventricle, aorta, coronary arteries, and carotid arteries) and the size of the magnetic field needed to obtain useful physiological signals. The final goal is to determine locations and blood-flow vectors (magnitude and direction) that may be used as functional biomarkers for cardiac function in healthy and HF subjects. 

Previous work: 
In the first phase of the this project a MHD solver was developed that reads in a given flow distribution and, based on a novel quasistatic approximation, calculates the resulting electric field distribution due to the application of an external magnetic field and its interaction with the charged particles in the blood flow. The solver has been fully integrated into SEMCAD X and works with the detailed anatomical full-body models available for SEMCAD X. The SEMCAD X modeling, import and export feature have been extended (including scripting interface). Novel postprocessing functionality has been added. 

Statement of Work: 
The purpose of this purchase order is the validation of the previously developed MHD solver and its application to a model case (based on Virtual Family male).  For this the following tasks need to be performed: 
1) Development and delivery of aorta and vena cava models suitable for computational flow simulations based on the Virtual Family male data. The aorta model should include the descending and abdominal aorta with branches into iliac arteries (abdominal bifurcation). The vena cava model should include the anterior and posterior part of the vena cava model. All models should be delivered as CAD models in *.sat format. 
2) Transient (pulsatile) simulations of realistic temporal blood flow distribution (unlike the steady state flow solution used under contract HHSF22320081116P) with 0.01 second temporal resolution in the vessel structures developed in Task 1 using flow solvers. 
3) Comparison of the spatial and temporal simulated blood flow distribution with MRI velocity measurements which are compatible with the original Virtual Family male model. The simulated data should be within 20% of the MRI velocity measurements. 
The FDA will use the MHD solver developed under contract HHSF22320081116P to select optimized surface locations, on the Virtual Family male model, for MHD measurements. These locations will be provided to the contractor so that they may: 
4) Extract MHD time curves for the selected optimized surface locations from multiple MHD simulations, 
5) Compare ECG (free space) and ECG+MHD (in 3 Tesla MRI field) simulations to recorded measurements, under the same conditions, from an anatomy similar to the actual Virtual Family male model. 

QUESTIONS DEADLINE: all questions must be received by email (david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov) before 4:30 pm (1630) EST on 4 May 2009.  

Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination.

It is the government's belief that only MFG KEYSTONE, INC, or authorized distributors can provide these critical parts. Note: No Drawings, Specifications or schematics are available from this agency. That information is proprietary to MFG KEYSTONE, INC and the Coast Guard is unable to supply any information other than part name and part number to prospective offerors. However, other potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities to manufacture these parts to OEM specifications are invited and encouraged to submit proposals. The following information must be provided to evaluate past performance: evidence of past successful manufacture to OEM specifications of all required parts, for the government, OEM, or secondary market, to include evidence of durability and that the parts met normal life cycle expectations without failures.  Quotations submitted in response to this solicitation must include: (1) Solicitation number HSCG85-09-Q-66PB43; (2) CLIN number, item name, part number, and unit/extended prices for all CLIN’s (3) proposed delivery after receipt of order in calendar days for each CLIN; (4) past performance information as required above (5) verification that each item shall be individually preserved, packaged, marked, bar-coded and shipped surface freight in accordance with best commercial practices; (6) taxpayer identification and Dun & Bradstreet (DUNS) number and Central Contractor Registration (CCR) number; (7) Contractors full name, address, and telephone number.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.  Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—  (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><p>This notice is amended to expand its' scope&nbsp;to include&nbsp;a Visual System Replacement (VSR) upgrade, to&nbsp;be Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) as a modification task, representative of the kinds of changes that will be accomplished under the KC-135 ATS program in out-years but which cannot be defined and priced at this time. This will provide a meaningful opportunity to price a task with the kind of Labor Skills mix and subcontracting managment that will be expected in these out-year changes to the ATS.&nbsp; Note that part but not all VSR required funding will be available at the outset of the newly awarded contract, and some applicable line items will be described as options. Draft documentation in the KC-135 notice will be amended in the next few weeks to address functional requirements, specifications, and schedules and to detail additional evaluation criteria which will be created in the section M (model contract) for this expanded effort. The Air Force intends to promote a fair and open competitive procedure for this mod task to be accomplished within the context of the KC-135 ATS solicitation. Opportunities for small business participation will also be promoted in accordance with the special provision for enhanced small business participation in the draft KC-135 ATS documentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; An opportunity for a technical conference at McConnell AFB, Wichita, Kansas,&nbsp;will also be provided on Monday, 15 Jun 09.&nbsp; This will not be a full Industry Days conference, but an opportunity to observe an Operational Flight&nbsp;Trainer (OFT) to see exterior mounting surfaces, etc.&nbsp; Access to the Visual System Mirror and Display Bay cannot be allowed, but a meaningful look at the OFT will be provided.&nbsp;Rules of engagement in exchange with Government&nbsp;representatives and incumbent contractor employees at the site, security information for access to the base, and an agenda for the technical conference can be obtained from MR.

<CONTACT>Collette A Grosselin, Contract Administrator, Phone 3106535602, Email collette.grosselin@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC><p>The 61st Contracting Squadron, Los Angeles AFB, CA intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for acquisition for replacing entry doors in Bldg 270 and 271 at Los Angeles AFB, El Segundo, CA. The Government is soliciting for the award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract. This proposed contract is being considered as a set-aside under a small business set-aside program. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 238290. The size standard for NAICS 238290 is $14.0 M. The government is interested in all small businesses including (8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses that are interested in performing this requirement. The government requests interested parties submit a brief description of their company's business size (i.e. annual revenues and employee size), business status (i.e., 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, small business) anticipated teaming arrangements, and a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners. The Government will use this information in determining its small business set-aside decision.
<p>This project consists of replacing the store front doors for Bldg 270 abd 271 because existing doors are difficult to open and close due to wind and internal building pressure with same, similar, or equivalent sliding electric doors. The Contractor will also be responsible to install applicable security equipment for the doors and meet ADA standards and requirements. Doors will have sensors that will open when an individual approaches from either the interior or exterior of the building. The Performance Period for this project is estimated to be one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days after receiving the Notice to Proceed. The magnitude of this project is estimated between $100,000 and $250,000.</p>
<p><br />The evaluation technique to be utilized for the contemplated award of the issued solicitation is Performance Price Trade-Off (PPT). Under PPT, past performance will be evaluated. The Government anticipates the issuance of the Request for Proposal in March 2009 and anticipates a closing in April 2009. The target award date is May 2009.</p>
<p>Interested parties should register online and subscribe to receive procurement announcements related to this solicitation by entering the website at http://www.fbo.gov. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for release of the solicitation package. To be eligible for contract award, offerors must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. Contractors must also submit their representations and certifications at the online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) website at https://orca.bpn.gov. There will be no paper copies of this solicitation available. The RFP will be released using the Electronic Posting System (EPS) available at http://www.fbo.gov. All solicitation information may be obtained through the above referenced website. The Government will not reimburse any interested parties for monies spent to provide a response to the subsequent solicitation notice. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation at any time.</p>

<DESC> Security Compliance Posture Monitoring and Reporting (SCPMaR) 

The Department of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires an integrated security compliance posture monitoring and reporting solution that will provide the IRS with the ability to monitor, measure, and manage the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) compliance of its implemented technical security controls, enterprise-wide. Towards this end, the IRS is conducting a 100% Small Business Set-Aside competition among GSA Federal Supply Schedule Holders only. We will be soliciting requests for proposals (RFP) from eligible vendors who can provide an integrated comprehensive solution that meets the following minimum requirements.

Security posture is defined as: Level of assurance that adequate technical security controls have been implemented to meet the information protection needs, as defined by Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 200, and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53.  Security posture metrics are defined as:
&#61607;	Degree of assurance that the technical security controls and security configurations defined by IRS and NIST have been implemented.
&#61607;	Level of assurance that security patches specified by the IRS Computer Security Incident Response Center (CSIRC) and the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) have been implemented.
&#61607;	Identification of IRS CSIRC/US-CERT-announced security vulnerabilities have been enumerated (e.g., SANS Top 20 and CVE) utilizing the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

Term and Condition – Solution Qualification Criteria

The “solution” – Security Compliance Posture Monitoring & Reporting (SCPMaR) System, must provide the following functional, operational, import/integration and reporting capabilities:

Functional capabilities:
1.	The solution shall monitor and measure the effectiveness of IRS’s implementation of mandated security controls (i.e. security configuration benchmarks) on computing assets, enterprise-wide, and in a timely manner.
2.	The solution shall manage security configurations throughout the system life cycle by assessing and reporting the level of compliance with IRS and US Government standard technical security controls. 
3.	The solution shall use NIST-defined Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP).

Operational capabilities:
4.	The solution shall automate the security compliance assessment and reporting processes to reduce the level of effort in coordination and execution, across the enterprise.
5.	The solution shall facilitate the risk management process by verifying that computing assets operate within the established security configuration baselines and identify risks at the appropriate level of abstraction.
6.	The solution shall support IRS change control processes by assisting the authorized organizations to define and maintain baseline security configurations with risk commensurate deviations throughout the system life cycle.

Import/Integration capabilities:
7.	The solution must integrate with IRS's existing IT computing infrastructure which operates in a geographically diverse environment and consists of approximately:
&#61607;	120,000+ Windows XP desktop workstations and laptops
&#61607;	1,000+ Windows-based servers running Windows 2000 Server 
&#61607;	3,000+ Windows-based servers running Windows 2003 (x-32 and x-64 bit platforms)
&#61607;	1,000+ Unix-based servers running Solaris 8, 9, and 10
&#61607;	300+ UNIX-based servers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5
&#61607;	100+ UNIX-based servers running HP-UX 11 and IBM AIX 5.2

8.	For interoperability to existing IRS IT investments, the solution must be able to import or integrate data from existing IRS platforms, systems and tools including but not limited to:
&#61607;	Import a list of identified vulnerabilities generated from ISS Internet Scanner (Version 7.x or most current release) and Nessus (Version 3.x or most current release).
&#61607;	Import a list of required security patches specified by IRS or US-CERT.
&#61607;	Integrate with IRS Directory Service (DS) (i.e., Microsoft Active Directory Service) and IRS Employee User Portal (EUP) (i.e., SiteMinder) for user authentication.
&#61607;	Integrate with NetIQ Group Policy Administrator.
&#61607;	Integrate with Altiris Patch Manager and Sun N1 Patch Manager.

Reporting Capabilities:
9.	The solution must provide FISMA compliance reports in accordance with OMB M-07-19 and Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) compliance report as defined in OMB-M-07-11 using NIST-defined FDCC reporting format.

<SUBJECT>Gene-environment interactions and risk factors for rare lymphoma subtypes and pooled analyses within the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph)
<SOLNBR>NCI-90093-AV
<RESPDATE>051809
<CONTACT>Ashley L. Virts, Email virtsa@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>Notice has been amended to correct period of performance. The correct period of performance is a base year plus one option period.




The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) plans to procure on a sole source basis, Gene-environment interactions and risk factors for rare lymphoma subtypes and pooled analyses within the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph)
with Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Department of Health Science Research, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905-0002.

The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-(b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541711 the business size standard is 500 employees.

Period of Performance is twelve months from the date of award.

The Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) within the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is currently conducting studies to understand the relationship between environmental and genetic factors and risk of NHL and its subtypes. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is composed of many closely-related, yet heterogeneous, diseases characterized by the malignant transformation of lymphoid cells but with distinctive morphologic, immunophenotypic, genetic, and clinical features. The strongest and most consistently observed risk factor for NHL is severe immunodeficiency, but the etiologies of most lymphomas remain unknown. InterLymph was formed in 2001 to undertake collaborative epidemiologic research to help discover the causes of NHL.

Recent results from individual studies participating in the InterLymph Consortium have    further suggested intriguing gene-environment interactions (e.g., autoimmune conditions, obesity, sun exposure, hepatitis C and atopy with TNF/IL 10 genotypes, and cigarette smoking with NAT1/2 phenotypes). However, none of the individually reported gene- environment interactions have sufficient power to robustly demonstrate such interactions statistically. In addition, data are lacking regarding potential specificity of the reported gene-environment interactions by NHL subtype. A unique opportunity therefore exists to examine pooled analyses within the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph).

The purpose of this procurement is to obtain the services of a contractor experienced in collaborating with InterLymph, as well as the conduct of pooled epidemiologic studies. Specifically, the contractor shall: (i) coordinate the request and receipt of key variables (e g., environmental and genetic factors, and lymphoma subtype definitions) from all participating InterLymph studies; (ii) harmonize key variables across all studies with detailed documentation regarding data cleaning and translation; and (iii) create pooled datasets for specific InterLymph analyses. In addition, because of the complexity of the consortial collaboration, the Data Coordinating Center at the Mayo Clinic has a history of effective, ethical and responsible collaborations with multiple institutions as well as high-quality computing, statistical and informatics resources including dedicated time of experienced data manager and analysts to standardize data and perform basic data analyses. Most importantly, the Mayo Clinic houses computing resources, server space, IT support and an encrypted contributor web-site for a data dictionary, documentation for variable creation, description of database software, specific statistical approaches and other key information needed to analyze the allotted information in the InterLymph study.  Because the Mayo Clinic is the only Data Coordinating Center for InterLymph, it is essential that they perform the requested services.

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can meet this requirement. One (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 a.m. ET on May 18, 2009. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to Ashley Virts: virtsa@mail.nih.gov. It is the vendor’s responsibility to ensure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractor must have valid, updated registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). Please reference NCI-90093-AV on all correspondence.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The National Cancer Institute intends to procure the services of the Battelle Memorial Institute, 505 King Avenue, Columbus, OH 43201 for this new requirement.

The sole source acquisition is justified under the statutory authority contained in 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) and the following authority contemplated by FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2).  “When supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.”  We could not locate another contractor with validated experience and security clearance in the very specific process of performing an aerosol spore challenge of Bacillus anthracis that is classified as a Category A human pathogen and is subject to strict Federal Control measures. Battelle Labs in Columbus, OH is the only place capable of performing the work of the SOW (investigating an NCI vaccine candidate against anthrax in a BSL-3 facility capable of handling aerosol anthrax) in a testing facility that meets government and safety requirements, and where the results will be interpretable with prior data and thus satisfactorily meet the government’s objectives.  Battelle lab has limited space for rabbit experiments of the type required by this SOW, and research facilities from across the country are requesting use of these particular Battelle facilities.

<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking a contractor to provide testing of a proposed new anthrax vaccine.</p>
<p>The Metabolism Branch, NCI has developed a safer and more immunogenic vaccine candidate against anthrax by integrating a codon-optimized gene encoding the protective antigen (PA) of Bacillus anthracis into the genome of Dryvax (Wyeth) vaccinia strain and Modified Virus Ankara (MVA) strain of vaccinia virus. The purpose of this procurement is to ascertain the efficacy of this NCI-owned vaccine against an experimental challenge of B. anthracis in a specific rabbit model of disease and it is necessary for the government to correlate immunological findings of the NCI owned vaccine candidate against anthrax with results from other completed studies. This challenge study will provide critical information as to the immunogenicity, reactogenecity and correlates of immunity for these anthrax vaccines in an appropriate, validated small animal model (Hermanson, G. et al PNAS, 2004, 101: 13601-13606), a required step before a vaccine could be used in people.</p>
<p>It is critical that the facility performing this evaluation is experienced with the complex methodology of procuring and housing rabbits under appropriate conditions for aerosol inoculation with the targeted B. anthracis spore (Ames strain) inhaled dose. The facility performing this testing must be able to provide a validated stock of known lethal dose titrer B. anthracis spores for the aerosol inoculation required and to perform bacteremia evaluations on serum after bleeding the injected rabbits from an auricular artery or vein.</p>
<p><br />The Government anticipates that one (1) cost-plus-fixed-fee type contract will be awarded for a period of four (4) months. The anticipated solicitation issue date is approximately on or around&nbsp;June 1, 2009, and proposals will be due approximately 30 calendar days after the solicitation issue date. The RFP will be available at the website of the Office of Acquisitions (OA), NCI, at the following url: http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/appl/rfp/published_rfps.jsp . IT IS THE OFFEROR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE ABOVE INTERNET SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION AND ANY AMENDMENTS. The NAICS Code is 541380 with a size standard of $12 million per annum. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. Point of contact is Michael P. Marino; electronic mail address: marinomic@mail.nih.gov ; telephone: (301)435-3801; fax: (301)402-6699. Collect calls will not be accepted.</p>

The project work location is in the U.S. Coast Guard Base Mobile, Mobile County, Alabama.

The solicitation in its entirety and any amendments will be available at no charge online at http://www.fbo.gov under the above solicitation number.   At the present time, this acquisition is expected to be issued as a Small Business set aside. However, in accordance with FAR 19.1305, if your firm is HubZone certified or 19.1404, if your firm is SDVOSB and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by e-mail to Odalys.McGee@uscg.mil or by fax at (305)-278-6696.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER DTFH61-02-C-00001.

A modification was issued to contract DTFH61-02-C-00001 for ARRA related information technology support services for the Federal Highway Administration.  A cost reimbursement modification was issued to the contract.  The use of a fixed-price modification is impractical because the nature of the work involves information technology support services which cannot be adequately defined to a level permitting a fixed-price modification.  The requirement was not competed because a contract for general information technology support services for the Federal Highway Administration is already in place.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>Not-yet-awarded
<DESC><p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS), Office of Systems Development, Ground Systems Division intends to negotiate with Real Time Logic, Inc. on a sole-source basis for spare receivers and individual spare parts for T400XR telemetry receivers previously acquired from RT Logic. These spare units are necessary for operations support to be distributed to maintenance supply at both satellite tracking stations at Wallops, Virginia and Fairbanks, Alaska. The design of the hardware, firmware and software that comprises the T400XR receiver is only known by RT Logic. In addition to NOAA missions, the NOAA Polar Acquisition System (NPAS) satellite ground system also supports the Initial Joint Polar System (IJPS) which operates jointly between NOAA and EUMETSAT under an international agreement and the OSTM/Jason-2 mission as part of an international agreement between NOAA, NASA, CNES and EUMETAAT. Any failure of the NPAS ground system could impact both the IJPS and the Jason-2 missions which would create a risk for NOAA of not being able to fulfill the terms of the international agreements. The resultant purchase order will be awarded under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The NAICS under this procurement is 334220. This notice constitutes the required publication of a proposed contract action in accordance with FAR 5.203. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this notification will be considered by the Government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
