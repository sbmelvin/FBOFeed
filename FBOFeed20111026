<DESC>Description<br />1. This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for information purposes only and neither constitutes a solicitation nor a commitment by the government to award a contract now or in the future. Submitting information for this RFI is voluntary, and participants will not be compensated. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.
<p>2. The ASC's Special Operations Forces and Personnel Recovery Division of the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Directorate is soliciting information to identify possible non-developmental sources for the follow-on production and engineering support of the Precision Strike Package (PSP) Mission Operator Pallet (MOP) for the MC-130J.

With the exception of the gun and the EO/IR sensors the MOP powers all of the mission equipment both on and off the pallet. The MOP hosts the battle management system software and the fire control system software and, through operator controls, controls the employment of SOPGMs and firing of the gun.</p>
<p>3. Responses to this RFI should assume very limited (TOs) United States Government (USG) provided data for MC-130J aircraft and variants and no design data for the MOP structure and MOP hardware/software architecture.

<p><br />a. Responses should address any safety concerns/considerations and integration challenges associated with the MOP.</p>
<p>b. Identify certification efforts required to support use of your system and proposed timeline to achieve that certification..</p>
<p>c. Your relevant experience with recent weapon system control stations involving the integration of sensors, communication systems and weapons.</p>
<p>d. The process used for airworthiness certification of your proposed solution.</p>
<p>e. Provide a notional schedule clearly showing contract award, long lead procurement, production milestones, integration/development &amp; test, technical order development, and logistics/sustainment events with assets available and IOC. Delivery of the first system is required in Jan 2013 and must be certified and ready for aircraft installation.</p>
<p>5.Responses to this RFI shall be limited to 25 pages in length, not including the cover page or exhibits (including pictures within the text). Do not submit classified data. It is desirable, but not required, that responses be submitted on CD-ROM in an electronic format compatible with Microsoft Windows/Office with no macros. Two copies of the paper submittals should be submitted; this is in addition to, or in lieu of the CD submittal. If the CD contains proprietary/competition sensitive material, the CD and the cover label should be marked &#8223;Proprietary/Competition Sensitive Material". Paper copies must be clearly labeled &#8223;Proprietary/Competition Sensitive Material". Proprietary/competition sensitive material will be protected from disclosure. As appropriate, e-mail copies of the paper submittal will also be accepted.</p>
<p>6.Your response must be received no later than 10 Nov 2011. Responses should be sent to ASC/WISK, Katherine Hamblin (Com: 937-255-3594, e-mail: Katherine.Hamblin@wpafb.af.mil, Bldg 46, 1895 Fifth Street, WPAFB OH 45433-7200.

<DESC>NASA/ARC intends to extend Contract NNA08AF13C (Ames Research Center InformationTechnology Support & Services 2, commonly referred to as ACITS 2) with Dell ServicesFederal Government (previously Perot) on a sole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of Ames Research Center's (ARC) CodeI, Information Technology Directorate. The performance period will be extended for amaximum of eight (8) months (December 1, 2011 - July 31, 2012), consisting of one three(3) month base performance period and five (5) one-month option periods. A contractmodification reflecting this extension and resultant increase in the estimated Cost PlusFixed Fee (CPFF) of the contract will be issued on or before December 1, 2011, theexpiration date of the ACITS 2 Contract NNA08AF13C.The current Contractor provides the following mission critical support services underACITS 2: IT Systems and Facilities Support:  The contractor is responsible for providing SystemAdministration, IT Security, Facility Support, Hardware/Software Maintenance, ApplicationManagement, Data Storage and Retrieval, Customer Support, Technical Planning, Analysis,and TrainingNetwork/Communications Systems and Support:  The contractor is responsible for providingNetwork Design and Development, Network Services, Distributed Systems, Audio, Video, andVoice Communication Systems, Wireless/Emergency Communication Systems,Network/Communication InfrastructureBusiness Systems and Support:  Financial Services, Human Resources, Security, Logistics,and Business Systems InfrastructureScientific Computing Systems and Support:  Scientific Computing consists of designing,developing, installing, modifying, configuring, operating, and maintaining software andcomputing systems in order to solve computationally intensive and/or complex engineeringand scientific problems in support of ARC missions, programs, and projects. Thecontractor is responsible for providing Scientific Applications, Data Acquisition andAnalysis, Modeling and Tool DevelopmentOutreach/Informational Systems and Support:  This information technology area isdominated by rich content that needs to be distributed efficiently and effectively tocustomers, whether they are internal to ARC, to NASA, or for the general public. Theseneeds include web applications, information-based systems for the design, development,installation, maintenance, operations, upgrades, configuration management, archiving,customer support, and security for content-rich, IT based data systems.  Examples includescientific databases and collections, geographical information systems, and digital imagearchive and retrieval systems, Library Systems, Conference/ Presentation/AdvocacySupport.This extension will allow for a continuation of services to ensure program continuity andcritical mission support and to avoid significant technical impacts to supported programswhile competitive follow-on acquisition NNA10301939R is completed. The extension will extend the period of performance of the current contract, NNA08AF13C,for a period of eight months, from December 1, 2011, through July 31, 2011, and increasethe contract value accordingly.  The current contractor, Dell Services Federal Government(previously Perot), is considered the only contractor that can meet ARCs needs given theshort period of performance for the extension. Awarding an eight-month contract toanother source, at the same time procurements and associated phase-in for NASAsAgency-wide Information Technology Infrastructure Integration Program (I3P) and ARCsfollow-on ACITS 3 requirement are in process, would result in substantial duplication ofcosts and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Governments requirements and not allowfor a sufficient phase-in period, thereby affecting the continuity of services andcausing unacceptable delays in fulfilling ARCs requirements.The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intendsto solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Thepurpose of this action is to bridge the performance period between the end of the currentcontract and the anticipated award of the follow-on requirement.  Offers have beenreceived for evaluation in response to NNA10301939R, the solicitation for the follow-oncontract, which was set aside for small business. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit theircapabilities and qualifications to perform the effort IN WRITING to the identified pointof contact not later than 4 PM PST on November 4, 2011. Such communication ofcapabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis,based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Questions regarding the extension can be sent via email to Jeannette Alabiez atjeannette.albiez@nasa.gov.

<CONTACT>Keith C. Echols, Senior Contracting Officer, Phone (478) 297-7583, Email keith.echols@gsa.gov
<DESC>Solicitation Number: #4QBP57113332
<p>Notice Type: Solicitation - Request for Proposal (RFP)</p>
<p>Synopsis: The subject solicitation will result in a direct negotiated award to Northrop Grumman Corporation, CAGE 34860, in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-2 under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2301(c)(1). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a proposal is being requested at this time and no other written solicitation be issued. This notice is issued as a RFP.</p>
<p>This solicitation is not a small business set aside. The NAICS code applicable to this procurement is 334511 (.Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing). This solicitation document incorporated provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-51. The FAR requires that prospective contractors complete electronic annual representations and certifications in conjunction with their required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database. These annual representations and certifications are submitted via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), a part of the Business Process Network (BPN) at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>
<p>The scope of this effort is to acquire a Manual Boresight and Sensitivity Table in support of the Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) system workload. Current workload of LANTIRN includes testing the capabilities of Laser Transmitter/Receivers (LTRs). Two of the tests required for the LTRs include a boresighting test and a sensitivity test. The current Manual Boresight table used to boresight LTRs consists of obsolescent equipment, some of which is proprietary to Northrop Grumman. Due to the obsolescence of the current Manual Boresight Table equipment, it is important that the shop possess an available spare for continued production. LANTIRN is under a current agreement with Northrop Grumman to have a sensitivity test provided (through combining some equipment used on the current Manual Boresight Table and equipment provided by Northrop Grumman). However, due to the obsolescence of the current Manual Boresight Table, interfacing this equipment with newer equipment is very difficult and inefficient. <br />The requirement is further defined in the attached Statement of work (SOW) dated 26 Oct 2011.</p>
<p>Delivery--18 months after receipt of contract</p>
<p>Contract Type: Firm Fixed Price (FFP)<br />Place of Performance: Work shall be performed at the Contractor's facility, WR-ALC and other USAF locales as determined by the Government and as required depending on mission requirements.</p>

<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB), plans to procure on a sole source basis services from the University of Southern California, 837 West Downey Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 for amino polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon content assays.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13.106 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 621511 the business size standard is $13.5 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for ten (10) months from date of award.</p>
<p>The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) is an intramural research program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) that conducts population and multidisciplinary research to discover the genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and new approaches to cancer prevention. The purpose of this requirement is to assay amino polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (amino-PAHs) levels in urine samples from the Shanghai Women's Health Study to assess the association between environmental PAHs exposure and cancer risk.</p>
<p>The University of Southern California is uniquely qualified to conduct the required assays. USC scientists have developed a sensitive assay to measure the most abundant amino-PAHs in human urines (1-amino-pyrene,1-aminonaphthalene, and 2-aminonaphthalene). This assay uses an HPLC-fluorescence technique that is sensitive enough to detect these animo-PAHs in the general population. Based upon results from NCI's market research, this technique is not available in commercial laboratories nor is NCI aware of any other research laboratories where a similar method is currently being used. As such, the University of Southern California is the only known source capable to fulfilling the requirements of this procurement.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 

This is a Request for Information (RFI) for OPNAV, N135, Millington, TN.  This RFI concerns the Draft Standards for Elliptical Trainers and Stationary Cycles.  This RFI does not constitute an Invitation for Bid, a Request for Proposal, or commitment of any kind by the U.S. Navy.  There will be no reimbursement or compensation provided for responding to this RFI.

DRAFT STANDARD FOR ELLIPTICAL TRAINERS

BACKGROUND
The U.S. Navy currently allows use of an elliptical trainer as one testing mode for aerobic capacity in its semiannual Physical Readiness Test (PRT).  The test is administered as follows:  The test-taker is given a suitable opportunity to warm up prior to testing.
  This warm-up may take place on the trainer or somewhere else prior to getting on the trainer.  The test then consists of a 12-minute exercise bout on the trainer at a resistance and pedaling speed of the test-takerâ€™s choosing.  At the end of the bout, the number of kilocalories expended is recorded and used in conjunction with the test-takerâ€™s weight to predict an equivalent 1.5-mile run time.  The twelve minute test period may be changed at some future date.
The Navy Physical Readiness Program desires that elliptical trainers used for testing be interchangeable so that equivalent performances on any trainer lead to equivalent run time predictions.  One way to achieve this goal is to standardize the accuracy with which kilocalories expended are estimated from braking force/power at the flywheel.
  This performance standard defines machine parameters for elliptical trainers that will lead to such equivalent performances.

GENERAL
To qualify for Navy PRT use, 
1.	The elliptical trainer must be constructed and operate in conformance with ISO Standards 20957-1 and 20957-9 (EN-957-1 & EN-957-9).  
2.	The elliptical trainer must conform to usage class S, professional and/or commercial use.

3.	The elliptical trainer must provide a speed-dependent exercise mode in which a fixed braking power is provided and the work performed varies with the stride frequency.
4.	The elliptical trainer must provide moveable handlebars in addition to the foot-platform pedals as a means of applying exercise torque to the flywheel.
5.	The elliptical trainer must not have a variable incline, or if the elliptical trainer is equipped with a variable incline, the incline is set in a pre-defined angle during the test and the controls for adjusting the incline are disabled.
  The user will not be allowed to alter the angle of the variable incline once the test begins.  At the beginning of the test, the variable incline is set to a pre-determined angle that provides accurate calorie counting for the effort.
6.	The elliptical trainer must not have a variable stride length.   The fixed stride length must be between 18.0 and 21.5 inches. 
7.	The elliptical trainer must have an accurate calorie counter.  The standard for accuracy is the agreement of the calories reported by the elliptical trainer with calories calculated from measured rates of oxygen consumption during exercise on the device.  A validation study must be conducted to demonstrate suitable accuracy of the elliptical trainer calorie counts.
  An elliptical trainer will be deemed suitably accurate if (1) the 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression of measured calories on device-indicated calories includes the value 1, and (2) the difference between the mean value of the measured calories and the mean value of the indicated calories lie in the range of -2 to +2 kcal for a 12 minute period.  Parameters of the validation study are: (1) it must include at least 75 comparisons of measured and indicated calories, (2) the measurements must be distributed over the range of 100 to 350 kilocalories in 12min, and (3) recording of measured calories can only be made after at least 3 minutes of exercise at the chosen load. This is done to allow the rate of oxygen consumption to stabilize at that load.
8.	The validation study must be conducted by an outside agent, not by the elliptical trainer manufacturer.


TEST OPERATION
The elliptical trainer needs to support a test in which the test duration (currently 12:00 min) can be entered at the console at the start of the test.
  A â€œstartâ€ button is pressed and energy expenditure in calories is accumulated for the specified time. At the end of the specified time period, the number of calories expended is saved and held on the display, and the test participant is allowed to continue pedaling to cool down.  Calories expended during warm-up or cool down are not added to the calories expended during the test. Specific requirements are:
1.	The test participant must be able to vary the resistance and stride rate during the test and during warm-up and cool down periods.
2.	The elliptical trainer needs to provide at least 450W of braking power at the input crank shaft.
3.	The elliptical trainer needs to have a â€œtimerâ€ function to provide a fixed-duration exercise test.
  Warm-up periods shall not be included in the â€œNavy Testâ€. Timing should be accurate to the nearest 0.5 second.  The test can allow for warm up with a prompt â€œPress Startâ€ to begin the test?
4.	A button (or other control) to begin the â€œNavy Testâ€ needs to be provided.  This can be a dedicated button labeled â€œNavy Testâ€, or can it be a multi-function button with â€œNavy Testâ€ as one of the options?  Pressing this button should reset the machine, put the elliptical in speed-dependent mode and prompt the user (either test-taker or test administrator) to enter the test duration in minutes and seconds and body weight in pounds to the nearest whole pound.
5.	Test time and body weight (to the nearest whole pound) must remain locked and displayed until the button to begin the test is pressed.
  This allows the test administrator to confirm the entries.
6.	A clearly marked â€œBegin Testâ€ button (or other control) must be provided on the console. This button can be a dedicated button labeled â€œBegin Testâ€, or can it be a button labeled â€œQuick Startâ€ with a prompt in the display stating â€œPress Quick Start to begin testâ€, or some similar prompt.  It should be placed so that either the test-taker or the test administrator can actuate it.  

7.	Once the â€œBegin Testâ€ button has been pushed, the elliptical trainer display must indicate cumulative kilocalories expended during the test to the nearest whole kilocalorie. The trainer must also provide a continuous display of the elapsed time in minutes and seconds to the nearest second, the resistance level and the stride rate or revolutionâˆ™min-1 (RPM) to the nearest RPM.
   Body weight in pounds must be displayed at the end of the test for test administrator.
8.	The elliptical trainer needs to calculate, update and display the sum of the kilocalories expended during the exercise bout at a rate of at least 1 sampleâˆ™second-1.  At any time, the sum displayed must be the cumulative sum of all calories expended rounded to the nearest whole kilocalorie excluding kilocalories expended during warm-up and cool-down.
9.	The elliptical trainer needs to retain and display the cumulative kilocalories and the body weight at the end of the timed exercise bout. These values must remain fixed on the display while the machine allows the test participant to continue striding, even at a different stride rate and/or resistance for a cool down.
10.	The accumulated kilocalories, the body weight (lb) and the test time should remain on the display until cleared by the test operator.
11.	The clock must run continuously from the beginning until the end of the test period even if the test taker stops exercising.
  The calories displayed will be the total for the specified test period, including the stopped interval.  If the machine is self-powered, the display must remain on at least 1 minute following the cessation of exercise by the test-taker.
12.	A test interrupt function needs to be provided to allow either the test-taker or the test administrator to stop the test prior to the finish.  If interrupted, the calories are not saved or displayed.
13.	At the end of the test, a button (or other control) needs to be provided to clear the display and provide a prompt to perform another test or quit testing, or return to the menu from which the test is launched.
14.	Indicating the intent to conduct another test should clear the display and prompt for test duration and body weight again.
15.	Indicating that testing is at an end should clear the display and put the elliptical trainer back in its basic start up mode.
16.	There shall be no indication on the elliptical trainer from the manufacturer that it is approved for the U.S.
 Navy test.
17.	The elliptical trainer shall not contain an algorithm to predict a run time or Navy PRT score from calorie expenditure.  Navy prediction models are subject to change, and differences in precision between the onboard processor and the Navy calculation methods lead to results that do not match Navy calculations closely enough.


DRAFT STANDARD FOR STATIONARY CYCLES

BACKGROUND
The U.S. Navy currently allows use of a stationary cycle as one testing mode for aerobic capacity in its semiannual Physical Readiness Test (PRT).  The test is administered as follows:  The test-taker is given a suitable opportunity to warm up prior to testing.  This warm-up may take place on the cycle or somewhere else prior to getting on the cycle.
  The test then consists of a 12-minute exercise bout on the cycle at a resistance and pedaling speed of the test-takerâ€™s choosing.  At the end of the bout, the number of kilocalories expended is recorded and used in conjunction with the test-takerâ€™s weight to predict an equivalent 1.5-mile run time.  The twelve minute test period may be changed at some future date.
The Navy Physical Readiness Program desires that stationary cycles used for testing be interchangeable so that equivalent performances on any trainer lead to equivalent run time predictions.  One way to achieve this goal is to standardize the accuracy with which kilocalories expended are estimated from braking force/power at the flywheel.
  This performance standard attempts to define performance parameters for stationary cycles that will lead to such equivalent performances.

GENERAL 
To qualify for Navy PRT use, 
1.	The stationary cycle must be constructed and operate in conformance with ISO Standards 20957-1 and 20957-5 (EN-957-1 & EN-957-5).  
2.	The stationary cycle must conform to usage class S, professional and/or commercial use.
3.	The stationary cycle must provide a speed-dependent training mode in which a fixed braking power is provided and the work performed varies with the pedaling frequency.
4.	The stationary cycle must have an accurate calorie counter.  The standard for accuracy is the agreement of the calories reported by the stationary cycle with calories calculated from measured rates of oxygen consumption during exercise on the device.
  A validation study must be conducted to demonstrate suitable accuracy of the stationary cycle calorie counts.  A stationary cycle will be deemed suitably accurate if (1) the 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression of measured calories on device-indicated calories includes the value 1, and (2) the difference between the mean value of the measured calories and the mean value of the indicated calories lie in the range of -2 to +2 kcal for a 12 minute period.  Parameters of the validation study are: (1) it must include at least 75 comparisons of measured and indicated calories, (2) the measurements must be distributed over the range of 50 to 200 kilocalories in 12min, and (3) recording of measured calories can only be made after at least 3 minutes of exercise at the chosen load.
 This is done to allow the rate of oxygen consumption to stabilize at that load.
5.	The validation study must be conducted by an outside agent, not by the stationary cycle manufacturer.

TEST OPERATION
The stationary cycle needs to support a test in which the test duration (currently 12:00 minutes) and body weight in pounds are entered at the console.  A â€œstartâ€ button is pressed and energy expenditure in calories is accumulated for the specified time. At the end of the specified time period, the number of calories expended is saved and held on the display, and the test participant is allowed to continue pedaling to cool down.  Calories expended during cool down are not added to the calories expended during the test.
 Specific requirements are:
1.	The test participant must be able to vary the resistance and RPM during the test and any cool down after the test.
2.	The stationary cycle needs to provide at least 450W of braking power.
3.	The stationary cycle needs to have a â€œtimerâ€ function to provide a fixed-duration exercise test.  Warm-up periods shall not be included in the â€œNavy Testâ€. Timing should be accurate to the nearest 0.5 second.
4.	A button (or other control) to begin the â€œNavy Testâ€ needs to be provided.  Pressing this button should reset the machine, put the cycle in speed-dependent mode and prompt the user (either test-taker or test administrator) to enter the test duration in minutes and seconds and body weight in pounds.
5.	Test time and body weight (to the nearest whole pound) must remain displayed until the button to begin the test is pressed.
  This allows the test administrator to confirm the entries.
6.	A clearly marked â€œBegin Testâ€ button (or other control) must be provided on the console.  It should be placed so that either the test-taker or the test administrator can actuate it.

12.	A test interrupt function needs to be provided to allow either the test-taker or the test administrator to stop the test prior to the finish.
  If interrupted, the calories are not saved or displayed.
13.	At the end of the test, a button (or other control) needs to be provided to clear the display and provide a prompt to perform another test or quit testing.
14.	Indicating the intent to conduct another test should clear the display and prompt for test duration and body weight again.
15.	Indicating that testing is at an end should clear the display and put the stationary cycle back in its basic start up mode.
16.	There shall be no indication on the stationary cycle from the manufacturer that it is approved for the U.S. Navy test.
17.	The stationary cycle shall not contain an algorithm to predict a run time or Navy PRT score from calorie expenditure.
  Navy prediction models are subject to change, and differences in precision between the onboard processor and the Navy calculation methods lead to results that do not match Navy calculations closely enough.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice and is for market research purposes only.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION OR BID.  NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is conducting market research to determine if there are a reasonable number of interested small business concerns with the knowledge, skills and capability to perform the work described below.  The proposed project will be performed at EPA?s Research and Administration Facility in Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina.  It is expected that the project will be accomplished under an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ), design-build contract which will include renovations of approximately 108 laboratory modules and 8 office modules (including fume hoods and laboratory casework).  A single IDIQ, design-build, fixed-price task order contract is expected to be awarded using FAR Part 15 procedures.  It is anticipated that the solicitation and resulting contract will specify a minimum order amount of $1,000,000, a maximum order amount of $20,000,000, and a maximum 5-year period for issuance of task orders.  
Responses to this sources sought announcement are to be sent via email to Scott Tharp, Contracting Officer, at tharp.scott@epa.gov,  no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Time on Monday, November 7, 2011. 
Project Description:
Currently the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) leases laboratory space, the Reproductive Toxicology Facility (RTF), in Durham, North Carolina, to house the EPA Reproductive Toxicology Division (RTD).  Prior to the expiration of the RTF lease on November 30, 2014, EPA intends to relocate approximately 107 RTF personnel to EPA?s main campus in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.
EPA?s Research and Administration Facility has more than 500 laboratory modules spread across five laboratory wings: A, B, D, E and High Bay.  Exhaust and supply air for individual lab modules are controlled by a building automation system (BAS) coupled with variable air volume (VAV) controls that modulate flow to provide occupied and unoccupied operating modes.
Wings A, B, D and E are five-story buildings with modular labs and offices located on two sides of a central service corridor.  Wing A has labs on the west side and a vivarium on the east side.  The High Bay is a two-story building with a combination of modular labs and offices.  Exhaust for fume hoods, bio-safety cabinets and general exhaust grilles are provided by 26 main exhaust fans and miscellaneous special exhaust fans.  One hundred percent outside air is supplied to the buildings by 29 air handling units.
In advance of the RTD relocation, numerous laboratory and office modules at the main campus must be remodeled and/or completely outfitted with fume hoods, increased electrical capacity and gas distribution, adjusted HVAC, and installed laboratory casework to accommodate the RTD?s research activities.
This holistic and laboratory specific, complex, multi-year project consists of a series of lab renovations followed by lab equipment installation and personnel relocations, all of which are to be accomplished with minimum interruption to the existing research functions at the RTP facility.   It requires extensive, detail-oriented coordination efforts among three independent entities of the project:  (1) the design-build contractor; (2) the transition team responsible for move services; and (3) EPA day-to-day operations.  The renovation work will range from minor laboratory modifications to the complete retrofit of office space into laboratory space.  The required work will vary for each module and may include removal, re-use and/or replacement of existing fume hoods, bio-safety cabinets, casework, laboratory gas tanks and racks, safety showers, laboratory plumbing, associated laboratory equipment, and free-standing (non-systems) office furniture.
Other Pertinent Information:
The associated NAICS code for this project is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building.  The size standard associated with NAICS 236220 is $33.5 Million, which means that a company, including its affiliates, would be considered a "small business" if their average annual gross receipts does not exceed $33.5 Million for the past three years.   
All interested, capable, and qualified Small Businesses, including certified HUBZONE, 8(a), Service- Disabled Veteran-Owned, or Women-Owned Businesses are encouraged to reply to this market survey request by submitting a narrative demonstrating their experience in design-build construction projects of similar nature as described above.  NARRATIVES SHALL BE NO LONGER THAN FIVE (5) TOTAL PAGES.  Please only include a narrative for the requested information; additional information will not be reviewed. 
Please include the following information in your response/narrative: (1) Company name, address, and point of contact information; (2) Identification and verification of the company's small business status; (3) Descriptions of Previous Experience ? within the past three years ? on projects considered similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity to the proposed EPA project, including architectural, engineering, and construction services for renovation of a large laboratory facility.  Please include dates of work, references, project costs, and complexity of the projects;  (4) The level of performance and payment bonding capacity that the company could attain for the proposed project;  (5) A statement of the portion of the work that will be self-performed on this project, and how it will be accomplished. 
This market survey is to determine whether or not this project should be set aside for small business or a small business subcategory based on the responses received.  If you have any questions, please contact Scott Tharp, Contracting Officer, at tharp.scott@epa.gov.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government.  Responses to this sources sought notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.

<SUBJECT>Market Survey - Request for Information - IT Services for DoD Purchase Card Data Mining and Risk Analysis
<SOLNBR>HQ0102-12-0001
<RESPDATE>112811
<CONTACT>Chris Webster, POC, Email chris.webster@dla.mil
<DESC>This is a Market Survey for Information Technology, I.T. professional services.
<p>In 2007, the Department of Defense (DoD) Purchase Card Program Management Office (PCPMO) procured a Data Mining and Risk Assessment (DM/RA) capability to:<br />&bull; Identify and report fraudulent and abusive spending and theft and misuse of government property associated with its purchase/payment cards; and<br />&bull; Report on the overall health of DoD Purchase Card programs at various levels in the<br />reporting hierarchy, based on compliance with purchase card internal controls as a component of the Purchase Card On-Line System (PCOLS)</p>
<p>This Market Survey represents a restructuring of the acquisition strategy for the Data Mining-Risk Assessment (DM-RA) portion of the PCOLS Program.</p>
<p>Acquisition Objective: The Purchase card On-Line System (PCOLS) has several components. This Market Survey is related to the integration of the Data Mining and Risk Assessment (DM &amp; RA) applications associated with the PCOLS application suite. The Government is seeking information on how an interested contractor would perform as the System Integrator for the DoD Purchase Card Program Management Office to perform tasks associated maintaining and sustaining the Data Mining and Risk Management functions of PCOLS while bringing together the component subsystems of the Purchase card Program into a whole and helping ensure that those subsystems function seamlessly. Such a firm would act as the Purchase Card Program Management Office's primary crossing point to PCOLS vendors, ensuring that business requirements are appropriately interpreted and integrated into the functional and technical architecture. This includes project management, scheduling, requirements gathering, software development, testing, and change control processes in coordination with the Program Management Offices.</p>
<p>Business Objective(s): The over-arching business objective is the adaptation of new technology which can be effectively and affordably deployed in PCOLS quickly. The functional business objective is to Mine Data from Purchase Card transactions via the deployment of a data-screening tool that uses a combination of discreet DoD-tailored business rules to detect card misuse, and a "neural learning" capability that enables the identification of transactions at the most risk of being fraudulent or abusive. The transactions mined will be screened, scored, and when appropriate, referred-to card mangers for review, and archived. In addition, the system is to "learn" from past transactions to build a knowledge base that improves scoring accuracy over time. This fully scalable risk assessment application will be equal or equivalent-to the current COTs sub-system (FICO's Falcon&reg; Fraud Manager<sup>TM</sup>). On a monthly basis, it provides a report card, based on transaction through-put from numerous financial institutions, which identifies and stratifies at-risk transactions, based-on the internal business rules established to ensure robust internal control of card use. This objective also includes the delivery of configurable web-delivered reporting within the confines of DoD Information Assurance regulations, including CAC-enabled single-sign-on for users.</p>
<p>Systems Description: PCOLS includes the DMDC Enterprise Monitoring and Management of Accounts (EMMA) which is used by multiple DoD information systems, Authorization, Issuance, and Maintenance (AIM), Data Mining (DM) and Risk Assessment (RA). EMMA is an application for the verification and provisioning of credit card officials and their supervisors. AIM is a workflow application for the approval, issuance and maintenance of the purchase card and provides the capabilities to the DM application to screen each purchase card transaction. DM and RA are a combined third party service. The DM algorithms uses DoD specific risk indicators coupled with account profiles, purchase patterns and purchase card transactions with the greatest potential for fraud, waste and abuse in regards to the laws, regulations and policies governing the DoD Purchase Card Program. The RA application provides Approving/Billing Officials (A/BOs), Agency/Organizational Program Coordinators (A/OPCs) and the Program Development Implementation (PDI) office with system generated transactions that have been identified at various levels of risk for action and response in the RA application.</p>
<p>System Architecture: Closely associated with DM&amp;RA is a sub-system developed by the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) which uses existing DoD personnel data in an integrated workflow to authorize Purchase Cardholder accounts and to process the results of the data mining output. DMDC maintains the historical files on purchase card transactions for the PMO. The selected contractor will be required to work closely with DMDC to ensure well-coordinated integration of these sub-systems.</p>
<p>PCOLS Transaction Profile: In FY 2010 DoD issued over 40,000 cards, at any time having approximately 105,783 cards and 48,800 managing accounts and processed 8,884,734 purchase card transactions through the PCOLS application valued at $7,772,622,463.</p>
<p>Vendor Qualifications: The contractor will be responsible to possess the necessary facilities, qualified personnel, supplies and equipment necessary to operate, update and maintain the Data Mining (DM) and Risk Assessment (RA) applications. If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must also meet these criteria. The Government anticipates full and open competition procedures for a single award of a Firmed Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), for a base award and three option periods.</p>
<p>Interested companies should submit a white paper that includes a brief description to include the following information: <br />1. Potential Technical Solution(s)<br />2. Capabilities to include: a. Information on the System Integrator; b. Information on the type of Data Mining Engine; c. Information on the Risk Assessment application and the success of the application; d. Any additional information to assist with evaluating the type of technology used for performance.<br />3. Summary Personnel Qualifications <br />4. Past experience in Data Mining and Purchase Card Operations<br />5. Past U.S. Government Contract experience. <br />6. Facility security clearance level. <br />7. Technology NAICS Codes in which the offeror normally conducts business. <br />8. Is the offeror small or large business.</p>
<p>Note: Clearly mark any information that is proprietary. More information about PCOLS may be located at: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/eb/pcols.html.</p>
<p>This Market Survey is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U. S. Government. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this Market Survey. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. Any information that the responder considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned, including any proprietary information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey. <br />Please submit your responses to: Mr. C. W. Webster, e-mail: chris.webster@dla.mil by 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Wednesday, 30 November 2011. <br />The Government will only accept written questions, via email, until 4:00 p.m. (EST) on Monday, 28 November 2011.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to acquire Underground Solutions Inc (UGSI) fusible polyvinylchloride (PVC) sewer pipe to be used for the construction of the Central Vehicle Wash Facility, Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii.  The Army intends to approve a justification to acquire UGSI fusible PVC sewer pipe to be used as required for the construction of the Central Vehicle Wash Facility located at Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii.  <br><br>The Army intends to incorporate the requirement for UGSI fusible PVC sewer pipe into the construction of the Central Vehicle Wash Facility located at Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii.  A separate purchase for sewer pipe is neither intended nor forthcoming.<br><br>The Directorate of Public Works requests to have UGSI fusible PVC sewer pipe for the construction of the Central Vehicle Wash Facility located at Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii.  The request requires the use of UGSI fusible PVC pipe from a single manufacturer to facilitate consistency and compatibility with the newly installed pipe systems.<br><br>The intent of the request is to utilize a monolithic, fully restrained, gasket-free and leak-free joints pipe system that provides 2x the flexibility of conventional bell-and-spigot pipe, eliminates the problems associated with spigot over-insertion, axial deflection, differential settlement, infiltration and ex-filtration as well as root intrusion, and has been preferred in seismically active areas.  This enables US Army Garrison-HI to efficiently maintain the pipe system by lowering operation, maintenance and repair costs over the entire life of the system.<br><br>Firms believing they have an alternate fusible PVC sewer pipe that can fully meet the fusible PVC sewer pipe standards of Underground Solutions Inc may submit a capabilities statement.  The capability statement shall be submitted no later than 10:00 a.m. HST, on 15 November 2011 by email to Dayna Matsumura at dayna.n.matsumura@usace.army.mil.  The statement shall include the following:<br><br>	a.	Provide fully detailed specification sheets describing the alternate fusible PVC sewer pipe offered that are equal to and fully compatible with the UGSI fusible PVC sewer pipe, see attached pdf file.  The specification sheets shall specify the manufacturer's name, address and country of manufacture.<br><br>	b.	Provide a narrative, no longer than 5 pages, addressing how the alternate fusible PVC sewer pipe offered is fully comparable and compatible with the UGSI fusible PVC sewer pipe, as attached.  For each of the standards listed in the attachment, provide an explanation of how your product will comply with and function in the same manner as the UGSI fusible PVC sewer pipe.  Connections, fittings, and systems of the alternate product offered must be completely interchangeable with UGSI fusible PVC sewer pipe.  The narrative shall also address the seamless connection of pipe lengths by the UGSI fusible PVC pipe without a bell or gasket of any kind incorporated into the piping system.<br><br>The Government will not assume any costs for preparing or submitting information in response to this announcement.

<DESC>The Bureau of the Public Debt, on behalf of Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General (FHFA OIG) intends to negotiate and award on a non-competitive basis a simplified acquisition in accordance with test procedures in FAR subpart 13.5 to Microsoft for professional services identified herein. <br />
<p><br />Background: FHFA OIG was recently established by law to provide independent and objective reporting to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). FHFA OIG's mission is to promote the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of FHFA's programs; to assist FHFA in the performance of its mission; to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse in FHFA's programs; and to seek sanctions and prosecutions against those who are responsible for such fraud, waste, and abuse.</p>
<p>As part of this, it is vitally important that they run independent of the main FHFA infrastructure as quickly as possible. FHFA OIG has begun Phase I of Microsoft Office 365 Cloud solution based upon the latest versions of Microsoft Technologies (Exchange 2010, SharePoint 2010 and Lync). Phase II requires additional computer network and voice-over-internet-protocol planning, analysis and implementation services in support of the final construction and deployment of its new cloud information technology network infrastructure and systems. This cloud technology is so new and advanced that only Microsoft is capable to perform Phase II support services. These services are contingent for FHFA OIG to run independently from FHFA. FHFA OIG will be one of the first agencies to go live on the cloud.</p>
<p>Phase II must begin immediately and the cloud knowledge and skill sets that the Microsoft engineers have by working in the FHFA OIG infrastructure will enable the implementation to proceed without delay. It is critically important to move forward with Phase II, since FHFA OIG will be moving into their new facilities on January 13, 2012.</p>
<p>No solicitation document is available. BPD will consider all affirmative responses received no later than October 28, 2011. Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement, at terms more advantageous to the Government. A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. If no affirmative written response is received, that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to make a sole-source award to Microsoft. Telephone inquires will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Electronic submission, in response to this notice, shall reference SS-FHG-12-0026 in the subject field and emailed to the attention of psb1@bpd.treas.gov. Electronic submissions must be received no later than 2:00pm ET, October 28, 2011.</p>
<p>Late responses will not be accepted or evaluated.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS: No solicitation document is available.</p>

The Agency will allow 40 industry participants in person and 50 participants via Defense Connect Online (DCO). The opportunity would provide an information exchange between government and industry, but is not a sales opportunity. Industry speakers should focus on areas outside of sales such as internal adoption efforts, experience with government and non-government clients, lessons learned and emerging techniques. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Each selected company will be allowed no more than two (2) participants.</span></p>

<DESC><br>The Department of the Army, Healthcare Acquisition Activity- North, Fort Detrick, MD, intends to negotiate a Sole Source commercial item procurement with Standard Imaging, Middleton, WI, to provide a quantity of one LUCY 3D Plus QA Phantom System.  This proposed procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than November 1, 2011, noon local time. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Point of contact Jessica Ely, Contract Specialist, e-mail: Jessica.ely@us.army.mil<br><br>The following verbiage is directly from the Justification and Approval for sole source and is posted in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6).<br><br>Lucy 3D QA Phantom is the only end to end stereotactic phantom that can perform image transfer QA, dosimetry QA, and machine QA within the exact coordinate system of stereotactic head frames.  No other phantom in the market can measure cumulative uncertainties and systemic variances of the entire stereotactic program to within 0.1mm giving you confidence in ensuring a faster commissioning process.  Standard Imaging is a sole source provider of this phantom.  The Exradin A16 is the smallest ion chamber available in the market for absolute dosimetry with a 0.007cc volume and a 3.4mm x 3.4mm field size.  Standard Imaging is a sole source provider of this ion chamber. The Max 4000 Electrometer has a wider range than any other electrometer in the market and is ideally suited for stereotactic due to its high spatial resolution at the lowest range providing resolution down to 1fA ensuring accuracy in precision for your measurements.  Standard Imaging is a sole source provider of this Electrometer.<br>The quality of our stereotactic program cannot be verified without these products and any uncertainties in treatment are not quantitatively measured.  This could result in significant errors going unnoticed and patients not being treated adequately as a result.  With the precision required for stereotactic treatments this product is critical to the clinical success and efficacy of our program.   It is paramount that any limitations in our system from CT to dosimetric delivery be accurately analyzed to guarantee successful stereotactic patient treatment with sub mm accuracy and to ensure no misadministration occurs.<br>

<DESC><br>The Department of the Army, Healthcare Acquisition Activity- North, Fort Detrick, MD, intends to negotiate a Sole Source commercial item procurement with ESM Digital Solutions Ltd, Dublin, Ireland, to provide a quantity of one R700 Perpetual Scanning Unit and 3-D analysis software and licenses to the USAF 35th Dental Squadron, APO, AP.  This proposed procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.

Point of contact Jessica Ely, Contract Specialist, e-mail: Jessica.ely@us.army.mil<br><br>The following verbiage is directly from the Justification and Approval for sole source and is posted in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6).<br><br>The ESM R700 Perpetual Scanning Unit is completely  self-contained, allowing digital model generation on-site, eliminating the need for extended contracts for this service from the distant scanning  laboratories currently available.  In addition, the unit produces a non-proprietary, universal file type (.stl) that can be viewed and manipulated with existing virtual modeling software, as well as allowing regeneration to an analog model with existing stereolithographic equipment currently used by the USAF.<br><br>This system will be used in the Orthodontic/Pediatric/Oral Surgery sections to eliminate the costly production of orthodontic plaster model sets for patient diagnosis and treatment planning.  In addition, it will allow the archiving of all plaster model sets to a digital file, eliminating the current storage need for over 300 orthodontic study casts per year that must be stored and maintained  indefinitely.  This system eliminates the need for mailing impressions to a third party for scanning  into a digital format, which is cost-prohibitive from an overseas location, where a same-day  turn around would be required.  Currently, this is the only in-house system that provides a non-proprietary  file-type for dental model scanning.  This file type can be used by USAF facilities to reproduce hard copies of the scanned models.<br><br><br>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

The following evaluation factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical (Facility Assessment consisting of cleanliness, security,  amenities), Location (must be located within 10 miles of the Wheeling, West Virginia City Limits ), Past Performance and Price.  Award will be based on the best value to the Government. Best value is based on the above criteria in the following manner: Technical is somewhat more important than Location which is somewhat more important than Past Performance which is somewhat more important than Price.

In accordance with this, we are excited about the deployment of a new system, Wide Are Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA).  This Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) system will benefit both you and the Air Force as we partner with each other in the implementation of this new way of conducting business.  It is also important to note that in addition to this, the Department of Defense (DoD) Appropriations Act of 2001, Section 1008 - Electronic Submission and Processing of Claims for Contract Payments, requires that any claim for payment under a DoD contract shall be submitted in electronic form.  The full text is found on the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) web site http://www.dod.mil/dfas/legislative/ and in 10 U.S.C Chapter 131.<br><br>WAWF-RA is designed to automate commercial invoices and government receiving reports in a web-based, paperless environment.  WAWF-RA allows vendors to create and instantaneously submit invoices and receiving reports directly to DFAS and/or government receivers from any location in the world.  Once documents are submitted, vendors are afforded full viewing capability and are able to monitor document status from submission to acceptance and processing by the DFAS payment office.  WAWF-RA utilizes e-mail to notify all parties involved in the payment process of the current status of each document; thus eliminating U.S. mail lag-time.<br><br>Since documents will now be entered and stored in a database, there is no need for multiple copies.  They cannot be "lost" or  "misplaced", and are viewable by all necessary parties during the entire payment process via a secure web site.  Changes to rejected documents can be easily made and resubmitted on-line - - no more re-typing, resending, or re-faxing.  Discounts become available on the first day of the discount period instead of being lost due to paperwork shuffling and postal delays.  WAWF-RA should speed up the vendor payment process and get you your money faster.<br>There are no costs involved to get you started.  Registration and software are provided FREE OF CHARGE and we will be available to assist you in every step of the way.  To get started, your company will need a user ID and password for accessing the WAWF-RA system.  This can be obtained by visiting the WAWF-RA website at https://wawf.eb.mil/ and following the instructions under Help with registration for access to WAWF-RA.  Under About WAWF - RA, you will also find links for Functional Information, Setting Up Your Machine, Accessing Web Based Training, and Frequently Asked Questions.  Additionally, we have attached a Wide Area work Flow - Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions, Installation, and Registration Checklist.  Should you have questions about the WAWF-RA system or the website, please don't hesitate to contact a Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) customer support representative toll-free at 1-866-618-5988 or e-mail them at cscassig@ogden.disa.mil.   (Please include "WAWF" in the subject line of all e-mail requests.)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions  <br>Installation and Registration Checklist <br><br>Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to  activation of the firm and user accounts.<br><br>1. Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) to see if your company is registered.  <br><br>* If you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below.  <br>* For help with registration in CCR, contact CCR Helpdesk,<br>888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725, e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil, or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.  <br><br>2. Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  <br><br>* All vendors desiring to bid on goods or services in support of Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/.  <br>* Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/FAX number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc.).  <br>* Note:  All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually.  Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.  <br><br>3. Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC).  <br><br>* The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company.  You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm.  <br>* To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/http://www.ccr2000.com/ and click on "Search CCR."  Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click "Submit Query."  If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS.  <br>* Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page.  There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC.  If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet.  If you see that there is no one listed as your company's EB POC, you need click on "Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN" to add it.  <br>* Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC's (primary and alternate) for each Cage/DUNS combination.  <br>* The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor's organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor.  <br>* Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes.  Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete.  For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html  <br><br>4.  Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM) (Proceed to paragraph 5 if you are not going to designate a GAM).  <br><br>* In medium to large sized companies, there may be a need to establish more than one GAM.  <br>* A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account.  <br>* The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC.  To appoint additional GAM's, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC.  <br>* The appointment letter should be faxed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center.  <br>* The Group Administrator's Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users.  <br>* The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.  <br>5.

<DESC><p>The Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Complex, Lompoc, California, intends to make a single award for providing a system designed for High Mast Lighting capable of and consisting of a Unit :</p>
<p>that will be installed between the service transformer and the distribution panel that feeds the high mast lighting system at (208 vac) and will be connected to the lighting load. When the power is applied to the lighting load, the (proposed unit) will sense that current is being applied to the lighting load and a 30-minute timing sequence will be initiated. <br />During the 30-minute timing sequence period, the service transformer nominal voltage is applied through the (proposed unit) to the lighting load. This permits the ballast/lamp systems that comprise the lighting load to stabilize at nominal light output in accordance with the lamp manufacturer specifications. At the conclusion of the 30-minute period, the (proposed unit) proprietary voltage control circuitry will reduce the output voltage to the lighting load by 10%. The 10% reduction in voltage permits the ballast/lamp systems which comprise the lighting load to operate in an energy saving mode which will result in a lighting load energy savings. The light output in this energy saving mode will not adversely impact the reduction in voltage.</p>

<CONTACT>Dr. Dennis Polla, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-baa-11-09@ugov.gov
<DESC>The semiconductor industry has been advancing rapidly with aggressive scaling.  Extending beyond the Moore's Law of digital processing and storage integrated circuits, this scaling has extended to 3-dimensions to keep pace.  This scaling trend has fostered the integration of diverse analog and digital components to provide high value systems such as sensors, actuators, and biochips.  The key capabilities to fabricate the high performance integrated circuit components for these high value systems are in the commercial foundries, which now dominate the world's production of high performance integrated circuits.  It is desirable for the US academic community and the US industrial base to have open and assured access to obtain the highest performance integrated circuits (IC's) and systems-on-chips (SoC's) while ensuring that components have been securely fabricated according to design and that intellectual property is protected.
<p>The goal of the TIC Program is to develop and demonstrate new split-manufacturing to chip fabrication where security and intellectual property protection can be assured. In split-manufacturing, the fabrication is divided into Front-End-of-Line (FEOL) consisting of transistor layers to be fabricated by offshore foundries and Back-End-of-Line (BEOL) consisting of metallizations to be fabricated by trusted US facilities.  In this approach, the design intention is not disclosed to the FEOL fabricators. The development and demonstration of split-manufacturing will start at the 130 nm technology node in Phase 1.  It is anticipated that the TIC Program performers will scale the development of their capabilities to the 22 nm node at the end of a five year period in Phase 3.  The Government will offer the performers foundry services for FEOL and BEOL via dedicated Multi-Project Wafer (MPW) fabrication runs of the selected foundry technologies through Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation System (MOSIS). TIC Program performers will be able to use these foundry technologies for their design applications.</p>
<p>IARPA's TIC Program seeks innovative concepts in the demonstration of the split-manufacturing concept applied to high performance chips (e.g., IC's, SoC's, and/or 3D IC's).  Offerors may propose to demonstrate the split-manufacturing concept in any of the following design applications:<br />&bull;	Mixed Signal<br />&bull;	Photonics-CMOS<br />&bull;	MEMS-CMOS<br />&bull;	Power-CMOS<br />&bull;	RF CMOS<br />&bull;	Memory-CMOS<br />&bull;	Josephson Junctions-CMOS<br />&bull;	Other systems integrated with CMOS</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

Justification: After examination, a marine engineering firm has determined that the floating dock is not suitable for the exposed marine location. The floating portion is subject to severe movement during high wind and wakes from marine traffic. This torque action has resulted in bolts becoming loose and undermining the dock structure. The unsteady dock exposes park visitors to potential slips, trips, pinch hazards, and falls.
Statement of Work:
1.  Remove and replace all 16 tie-rods connecting inboard and outboard whalers on the remaining 40' of floating          dock using 304 stainless steel hardware. 
2.  Remove seven (7) deteriorated galvanized internal pile guides for 14" square concrete piles.  Fabricate and           install seven (7) 304 stainless steel internal piles guides.
3.  Fabricate and install two (2) 304 stainless steel external pile guides for 14" square concrete piles.       
4.  Replace any damaged or missing whalers, fender boards, cleats etc., (Materials for this item will be provided      by the National Park Service).

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protests issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer of Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, DC 20593-0001, FAX: 202-475-3904.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>SUBJECT: Request for Information (RFI) Regarding National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) Prompt Diagnostics (PD) Concept Development<br /><br />1. The Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC), Division of Analysis and Requirements (XPZ), Patrick Air Force Base, Florida is seeking information from interested parties capable of developing options and down-selecting to an optimal system of PD sensors capable of satisfying NTNF requirements.
<p>2. Given a nuclear detonation (NUDET) designed/conducted with the goal of obscuring or misdirecting identification of responsible parties, NTNF is focused on providing information supporting a subsequent investigation. The primary event of interest is an atmospheric NUDET; therefore, the prompt observables include radiation (gamma, X-ray, neutron and fluorescence), RF, light, heat and shock. The goal of this RFI is the identification of sources for the development of an effective diagnostic system (sensor suite and concept of operation) for capturing features from a NUDET and capable of meeting lead federal agency requirements.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for<br>Program Management <br>Network and Enterprise Services (PM NES) <br>Establishment of <br>Mobile Device Management Services<br><br><br><br><br>Army Contracting Command National Capitol Region<br>200 Stovall Street<br>Alexandria, Virginia 22331-1700<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) SUPPORTS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A MOBILE DEVICE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SERVICING THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO FACILITATE ENTERPRISE MANAGEMENT OF MOBILE DEVICES. <br>Table of Contents<br>1.0	Background	4<br>2.0	Introduction	4<br>3.0	Vendor Instructions	5<br>4.0	Request for General Information	6<br>5.0	Objective	7<br>6.0	Request for Technical Information	9<br>7.0	Constraints	14<br>8.0	Transition and Transformation	15<br><br> <br>1.0	Background<br><br>The use of commercial mobile devices (CMDs), such as devices and tablets, offers an unprecedented amount of opportunity for advanced mobile computing and communications within the Department of Defense (DoD). However, the importance of adapting to these newly emerging technologies while also adhering to existing security policies and requirements poses major challenges moving forward. In the realm of CMDs, it is widely known that most mobile operating systems (OS) lack the basic functionality necessary to meet minimum DoD security requirements for protecting personal, military, and enterprise data. Therefore, the need to augment existing systems with additional administrative components as part of a greater architecture becomes paramount to ensuring security and functionality across a variety of mobile device platforms.<br><br>Some of the hurdles include, but are not limited to, the securing, monitoring, and management of CMDs. In addition, the provisioning and updating of these devices at an enterprise-level poses great challenges as DoD moves towards wide proliferation of devices and tablets. Overall, the obstacles faced by the DoD community can be potentially mitigated by utilizing a mobile device management (MDM) system capable of providing a central administrative framework for tracking and monitoring CMDs as well as ensuring security policy compliance among end-point devices. <br><br>2.0	Introduction<br><br>This RFI is issued as a means of technical discovery and information gathering. Program Management Network and Enterprise Services (PM NES) seeks to (1) become familiar with the current state of the MDM market, specifically to validate available MDM features and capabilities in existence today,  (2) identify those MDM companies which are exceeding the inherent supported baseline functionality of current device platforms and applying innovative approaches to providing a greater security and enterprise management model in their MDM platforms. PM NES seeks this information from industry, particularly from MDM vendors who specialize in the following types of mobile device management:<br><br> 	Software Distribution - The ability to manage and support mobile application use including deploy, install, update, delete or block.<br><br> 	Policy Management - Development, control and operations of DoD enterprise mobile access, connectivity, and security policy. <br><br> 	Inventory Management - Software, firmware, hardware, and peripheral device inventory management, this includes provisioning and support. <br><br> 	Security Management - The implementation and enforcement of DoD-level device security, authentication, validation and encryption functionality. <br><br>3.0	Vendor Instructions<br><br>DISCLAIMER<br>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR INFORMATION RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THE RFI.<br><br>This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to the RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Responses to the RFI will not be returned nor will the Government confirm receipt of the RFI response. Whatever information is provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.<br><br>The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541519 (size standard $25M).<br><br>Small businesses are strongly encouraged to provide responses to this RFI, in order to assist PM NES in determining the potential levels of interest, competition and technical capability to provide the required services within the Small Business community. In addition, this information will also be used to assist PM NES in establishing a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract plan small business goal percentages.<br><br>Submission Instructions<br><br>Responses should include the (1) business name and address; (2) name of company representative and their business title; (3) contract vehicles that would be available to the Government for the procurement of the product and service, to include General Service Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules (FSS), or any other Government Agency contract vehicle.<br><br>The responses should be in a white paper format, no longer than fifty (50) pages in length. Responses to this RFI are due NLT Wednesday 30 November 2011 at 5:00 PM Eastern (EST). Contact POC is Gregory Clark (Gregory.clark5@us.army.mil).<br><br>Proprietary Statement<br><br>Proprietary information and trade secrets, if any, must be clearly marked on all materials.

Can your MDM solution create configuration profiles (sometimes referred to as templates) that simplify the process of provisioning based on vendor, operating system, or model type?<br>77.	Can your MDM solution provide an audit trail capability? Many enterprises must comply with government regulations (e.g., Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard [PCI-DSS] and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA]) and must demonstrate their compliance with these regulations. Some MDM systems provide the ability to produce a provisioning audit trail and a resultant compliance report that can assist enterprises with their regulatory compliance-reporting obligations. Please describe in detail.<br>7.0	Constraints<br>The following constraints should be identified and mitigation processes defined in industry responses.<br><br> 	Compliance with Army security policies, guidelines and architectures including Top Level Architecture (TLA), Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert (IAVA) reporting, monitoring, etc. <br> 	DIACAP Authority to Operate (ATO)<br> 	Certificate to Operation (CTO)<br> 	Certificate of Networthiness (CON)<br> 	Army Interoperability Certification (AIC) <br> 	IPv6 Transition Preparation <br> 	Clinger-Cohen Act (CCA) Compliance <br> 	Information Assurance Strategy (AIS) - Required for CCA compliance and the others <br> 	Global Information Grid Bandwidth Expansion (GIG BE) connectivity <br> 	Continuity of Operations (COOP) and Disaster Recovery (DR)  <br> 	Army Environmental/Facilities requirements (if applicable), specifically: <br>o	Infrastructure  <br>o	Physical Security  <br>o	Survivability  <br>o	Time lines  <br>o	Required footprint/floor space<br>o	Approvals and Ownership  <br>8.0	Transition and Transformation<br>In any organization, change is always challenging.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 

This is a Request for Information (RFI) for OPNAV, N135, Millington, TN.  This RFI concerns the Draft Standards for Elliptical Trainers and Stationary Cycles.  This RFI does not constitute an Invitation for Bid, a Request for Proposal, or commitment of any kind by the U.S. Navy.

DRAFT STANDARD FOR ELLIPTICAL TRAINERS


BACKGROUND

The U.S. Navy currently allows use of an elliptical trainer as one testing mode for aerobic capacity in its semiannual Physical Readiness Test (PRT).  The test is administered as follows:  The test-taker is given a suitable opportunity to warm up prior to testing.
  This warm-up may take place on the trainer or somewhere else prior to getting on the trainer.  The test then consists of a 12-minute exercise bout on the trainer at a resistance and pedaling speed of the test-takerâ€™s choosing.  At the end of the bout, the number of kilocalories expended is recorded and used in conjunction with the test-takerâ€™s weight to predict an equivalent 1.5-mile run time.  The twelve minute test period may be changed at some future date.
The Navy Physical Readiness Program desires that elliptical trainers used for testing be interchangeable so that equivalent performances on any trainer lead to equivalent run time predictions.  One way to achieve this goal is to standardize the accuracy with which kilocalories expended are estimated from braking force/power at the flywheel.
  This performance standard defines machine parameters for elliptical trainers that will lead to such equivalent performances.


GENERAL

To qualify for Navy PRT use, 
1.	The elliptical trainer must be constructed and operate in conformance with ISO Standards 20957-1 and 20957-9 (EN-957-1 & EN-957-9).  
2.	The elliptical trainer must conform to usage class S, professional and/or commercial use.
3.	The elliptical trainer must provide a speed-dependent exercise mode in which a fixed braking power is provided and the work performed varies with the stride frequency.
4.	The elliptical trainer must provide moveable handlebars in addition to the foot-platform pedals as a means of applying exercise torque to the flywheel.
5.	The elliptical trainer must not have a variable incline, or if the elliptical trainer is equipped with a variable incline, the incline is set in a pre-defined angle during the test and the controls for adjusting the incline are disabled.
  The user will not be allowed to alter the angle of the variable incline once the test begins.  At the beginning of the test, the variable incline is set to a pre-determined angle that provides accurate calorie counting for the effort.
6.	The elliptical trainer must not have a variable stride length.   The fixed stride length must be between 18.0 and 21.5 inches. 
7.	The elliptical trainer must have an accurate calorie counter.  The standard for accuracy is the agreement of the calories reported by the elliptical trainer with calories calculated from measured rates of oxygen consumption during exercise on the device.  A validation study must be conducted to demonstrate suitable accuracy of the elliptical trainer calorie counts.
  An elliptical trainer will be deemed suitably accurate if (1) the 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression of measured calories on device-indicated calories includes the value 1, and (2) the difference between the mean value of the measured calories and the mean value of the indicated calories lie in the range of -2 to +2 kcal for a 12 minute period.  Parameters of the validation study are: (1) it must include at least 75 comparisons of measured and indicated calories, (2) the measurements must be distributed over the range of 100 to 350 kilocalories in 12min, and (3) recording of measured calories can only be made after at least 3 minutes of exercise at the chosen load. This is done to allow the rate of oxygen consumption to stabilize at that load.
8.	The validation study must be conducted by an outside agent, not by the elliptical trainer manufacturer.


TEST OPERATION

The elliptical trainer needs to support a test in which the test duration (currently 12:00 min) can be entered at the console at the start of the test.
  A â€œstartâ€ button is pressed and energy expenditure in calories is accumulated for the specified time. At the end of the specified time period, the number of calories expended is saved and held on the display, and the test participant is allowed to continue pedaling to cool down.  Calories expended during warm-up or cool down are not added to the calories expended during the test. Specific requirements are:
1.	The test participant must be able to vary the resistance and stride rate during the test and during warm-up and cool down periods.
2.	The elliptical trainer needs to provide at least 450W of braking power at the input crank shaft.
3.	The elliptical trainer needs to have a â€œtimerâ€ function to provide a fixed-duration exercise test.
  Warm-up periods shall not be included in the â€œNavy Testâ€. Timing should be accurate to the nearest 0.5 second.  The test can allow for warm up with a prompt â€œPress Startâ€ to begin the test?
4.	A button (or other control) to begin the â€œNavy Testâ€ needs to be provided.  This can be a dedicated button labeled â€œNavy Testâ€, or can it be a multi-function button with â€œNavy Testâ€ as one of the options?  Pressing this button should reset the machine, put the elliptical in speed-dependent mode and prompt the user (either test-taker or test administrator) to enter the test duration in minutes and seconds and body weight in pounds to the nearest whole pound.
5.	Test time and body weight (to the nearest whole pound) must remain locked and displayed until the button to begin the test is pressed.
  This allows the test administrator to confirm the entries.
6.	A clearly marked â€œBegin Testâ€ button (or other control) must be provided on the console. This button can be a dedicated button labeled â€œBegin Testâ€, or can it be a button labeled â€œQuick Startâ€ with a prompt in the display stating â€œPress Quick Start to begin testâ€, or some similar prompt.  It should be placed so that either the test-taker or the test administrator can actuate it.  
7.	Once the â€œBegin Testâ€ button has been pushed, the elliptical trainer display must indicate cumulative kilocalories expended during the test to the nearest whole kilocalorie. The trainer must also provide a continuous display of the elapsed time in minutes and seconds to the nearest second, the resistance level and the stride rate or revolutionâˆ™min-1 (RPM) to the nearest RPM.
   Body weight in pounds must be displayed at the end of the test for test administrator.
8.	The elliptical trainer needs to calculate, update and display the sum of the kilocalories expended during the exercise bout at a rate of at least 1 sampleâˆ™second-1.  At any time, the sum displayed must be the cumulative sum of all calories expended rounded to the nearest whole kilocalorie excluding kilocalories expended during warm-up and cool-down.
9.	The elliptical trainer needs to retain and display the cumulative kilocalories and the body weight at the end of the timed exercise bout. These values must remain fixed on the display while the machine allows the test participant to continue striding, even at a different stride rate and/or resistance for a cool down.
10.	The accumulated kilocalories, the body weight (lb) and the test time should remain on the display until cleared by the test operator.
11.	The clock must run continuously from the beginning until the end of the test period even if the test taker stops exercising.
  The calories displayed will be the total for the specified test period, including the stopped interval.  If the machine is self-powered, the display must remain on at least 1 minute following the cessation of exercise by the test-taker.
12.	A test interrupt function needs to be provided to allow either the test-taker or the test administrator to stop the test prior to the finish.  If interrupted, the calories are not saved or displayed.
13.	At the end of the test, a button (or other control) needs to be provided to clear the display and provide a prompt to perform another test or quit testing, or return to the menu from which the test is launched.
14.	Indicating the intent to conduct another test should clear the display and prompt for test duration and body weight again.
15.	Indicating that testing is at an end should clear the display and put the elliptical trainer back in its basic start up mode.
16.	There shall be no indication on the elliptical trainer from the manufacturer that it is approved for the U.S.
 Navy test.
17.	The elliptical trainer shall not contain an algorithm to predict a run time or Navy PRT score from calorie expenditure.  Navy prediction models are subject to change, and differences in precision between the onboard processor and the Navy calculation methods lead to results that do not match Navy calculations closely enough.


DRAFT STANDARD FOR STATIONARY CYCLES

BACKGROUND

The U.S. Navy currently allows use of a stationary cycle as one testing mode for aerobic capacity in its semiannual Physical Readiness Test (PRT).  The test is administered as follows:  The test-taker is given a suitable opportunity to warm up prior to testing.  This warm-up may take place on the cycle or somewhere else prior to getting on the cycle.
  The test then consists of a 12-minute exercise bout on the cycle at a resistance and pedaling speed of the test-takerâ€™s choosing.  At the end of the bout, the number of kilocalories expended is recorded and used in conjunction with the test-takerâ€™s weight to predict an equivalent 1.5-mile run time.  The twelve minute test period may be changed at some future date.

The Navy Physical Readiness Program desires that stationary cycles used for testing be interchangeable so that equivalent performances on any trainer lead to equivalent run time predictions.  One way to achieve this goal is to standardize the accuracy with which kilocalories expended are estimated from braking force/power at the flywheel.
  This performance standard attempts to define performance parameters for stationary cycles that will lead to such equivalent performances.


GENERAL 

To qualify for Navy PRT use, 
1.	The stationary cycle must be constructed and operate in conformance with ISO Standards 20957-1 and 20957-5 (EN-957-1 & EN-957-5).  
2.	The stationary cycle must conform to usage class S, professional and/or commercial use.
3.	The stationary cycle must provide a speed-dependent training mode in which a fixed braking power is provided and the work performed varies with the pedaling frequency.
4.	The stationary cycle must have an accurate calorie counter.  The standard for accuracy is the agreement of the calories reported by the stationary cycle with calories calculated from measured rates of oxygen consumption during exercise on the device.
  A validation study must be conducted to demonstrate suitable accuracy of the stationary cycle calorie counts.  A stationary cycle will be deemed suitably accurate if (1) the 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression of measured calories on device-indicated calories includes the value 1, and (2) the difference between the mean value of the measured calories and the mean value of the indicated calories lie in the range of -2 to +2 kcal for a 12 minute period.  Parameters of the validation study are: (1) it must include at least 75 comparisons of measured and indicated calories, (2) the measurements must be distributed over the range of 50 to 200 kilocalories in 12min, and (3) recording of measured calories can only be made after at least 3 minutes of exercise at the chosen load.
 This is done to allow the rate of oxygen consumption to stabilize at that load.
5.	The validation study must be conducted by an outside agent, not by the stationary cycle manufacturer.

17. The stationary cycle shall not contain an algorithm to predict a run time or Navy PRT score from calorie expenditure. Navy prediction models are subject to change, and differences in precision between the onboard processor and the Navy calculation methods lead to results that do not match Navy calculations closely enough.

Vendors interested in submitting elliptical trainers and/or stationary bikes for official PFA testing consideration should contact LCDR D. D. Peterson, OPNAV N135F Research Officer, at (901) 874-4310 or via email at david.peterson1@navy.mil. Include in the email Subject line: RFI for Draft Standards

NOTE: Packages submitted to the Navy will not be returned.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">**26 October 2011:&nbsp; The pre-solicitation notice is updated to change the response date.&nbsp; The solicitation is expected to be released in early November 2011.<br />**01 August, 2011:&nbsp; The pre-solicitation notice is updated.&nbsp; Updated text denoted in bold.<br /><br />The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services for the U.S. Consulates Montreal and Quebec City. The U.S. Consulates require a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The estimated number of annual hours for guard services at this location is approximately 71,000 hours. The Contractor shall be required to provide services that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel; dependents; property; destruction of assets; prevent unauthorized access; and, deter potential terrorist attacks. Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government). All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract. The Government plans to post the solicitation on this site mid-August 2011. No paper copies will be mailed. <strong>The Government will solicit this requirement&nbsp;as a small business set aside&nbsp;competition, using acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15.</strong> The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: The synopsis will be posted for approximately 15 days. Then the solicitation will be posted and the Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) period begins. Once the solicitation is posted on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately 60 days to submit proposals. All dates are subject to change and Offerors will be notified by registering on https://www.fbo.gov. Site Visit attendance is not mandatory, but highly encouraged. A site visit is expected to be scheduled approximately three weeks after the solicitation is posted. Offerors are responsible for entry visa (if required); all travel arrangements, local transportation, and accommodations in both locations. Due to space limitations, only two (2) representatives from each firm will be allowed for the conference and site visit. No questions will be answered concerning this requirement until the solicitation is posted. Once the solicitation is posted, questions may be submitted by email to Contract Specialist Matthew Colantonio at colantoniomj@state.gov. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. In accordance with 22 U.S.C. Section 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the lowest price, technically acceptable proposal.</p>

<DESC><p>The United States Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) in support of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to solicit on a non-competitive basis with Information Tool Designers, Inc., (ITD), to support a previously developed government-owned airborne network security simulator to develop an ANSS scenario and experiment for key airborne network security technologies (e.g. software data loading or EFB and Gatelink) with the goal of providing minimum recommendations (e.g., security checklists). The ANSS scenario and experiment shall include a use case, functional description, and architecture. The Volpe Center also requires the contractor to review and provide comments to ensure technical completeness and accuracy of the ANSS aircraft equipment manufacturer Flight Acquisition, Storage, and Transmission (FAST) System Penetration Test Report being developed by the UK Center for Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI). The contractor shall also support teleconferences with an aircraft equipment manufacturer and the Volpe Center regarding an aircraft equipment manufacturer's In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) ANSS Penetration Testing and this activity shall require a trip to an aircraft equipment manufacturer. The contractor shall support two teleconferences to discuss agenda items, such as: technical discussions with an aircraft equipment manufacturer regarding safety and security requirements for the IFE system, possible future CSET on the IFE system, operational security scenarios for ANSS testing, and IFE security control requirements. The purpose of the aircraft equipment manufacturer trip will be to participate in a demonstration of the IFE system and continue follow-up discussions from the prior two teleconferences (no preparation for the trip will be required by the Contractor). In addition, the Volpe Center is supporting the FAA in developing a Draft Aircraft Security Catalog/Airborne Network Security Guidance that is consistent with the DHS CSET tool. The Contractor shall develop the Guidance Document that instructs FAA certifiers on minimum level of security controls for specific types of airborne network components and FAA plans to develop an FAA Advisory Circular in 2011/2012 based on this guidance.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide research and prepare a report that will be used for input for the development of cyber-security recommended practices to be incorporated in the Security Guidance Document that can be referenced from regulations, standards, and guidance. Contractor support shall include: meeting coordination with Volpe and FAA, and participation, agenda development, briefing development, coordination with document authors, content development/review, and bi-weekly teleconferences. The following items are the 3 major sections of the document that the Contractor shall provide input on:<br />&bull; General Guidance for the Aircraft Certification Offices (ACOs) - High-level document referencing checklist tools to aid in this determination, templates for special conditions/issue papers and security plans<br />&bull; Supplementary Material - Issue Paper/Special Conditions templates<br />&bull; Recommended Best Practices - Minimum security baseline recommendations for securing standard Aircraft Components and archetypes (e.g. electronic flight bags (EFBs), Gatelink, 3gcellular, field loadable software, user modifiable software, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) avionics devices, integrated modular avionics (IMAs), internal/external connectivity, and wireless servers/routers) and the Contractor shall attend an automotive workshop with pertinent public sector and private sector automotive and aviation industry experts to perform a sample risk assessment of automobile control system applications. The Contractor shall develop high-level use case and risk assessment that can be used as a template to perform a future in-depth risk assessment. The contractor shall develop a preliminary Automotive Systems Characteristic Report which will be a key element of the overall assessment. The contractor shall use the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems, <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf">http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf</a> &nbsp;as guidance.</p>
<p>Travel will be required to the following locations: Washington DC; Seattle, WA, and CA.</p>
<p>A Request for Quote (RFQ) issuance will be on or about November 7, 2011. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541512 and the small business size standard is $25.0M.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)</p>
<p>1. This SOW provides for the following to like new condition of the Yellow Spindle Assembly (NSN 1615-01-HS1-4258, P/N 70102-28100-055) for the Coast Guards Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), MH-60 fleet. The spindle identified in the Description of Items or Services will be furnished to the contractor at the prices established at award for overhaul. The information contained in the scope of work is not intended to be all inclusive or to detract from procedures outlined in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specification except where noted herein. All repair actions shall be in accordance with the OEM commercial repair manuals and Federal Aviation Regulation Parts 43 and 145 or alternate standard approved in writing by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Medium Response Recovery (MRR) Engineering Branch. Components furnished hereunder shall be returned by the contractor in an airworthy condition and in all respects suitable for installation in USCG aircraft. Certification and documentation requirements apply.</p>
<p>2. The contractor shall provide all necessary parts, material, labor, tooling repair manuals, test equipment and facilities to evaluate and overhaul the spindle assemblies for the Coast Guard fleet of MH-60 helicopters, as necessary to conform to the requirements of this SOW at the firm-fixed pricing established in the contract schedule. The contractor shall provide the data and documentation requirements specified as part of this SOW.</p>
<p>3. The work shall be in accordance with the OEM specifications except where noted herein. All Sikorsky ORI's that are applicable to the Naval Hawk production line shall be used in the performance of this contract.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Wilkes Barre, PA Medical Center (WBVAMC) intends to solicit quotes for psychiatry services. The WBVAMC anticipates issuing a solicitation for this requirement on or about 26 October 2011. The solicitation will be issued as a total small business set-aside, and the acquisition will be accomplished using the procedures described in VAAR Part 873. The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov. Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies will be made available. The solicitation will provide full information to contractors about the quote submission process. Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments.

The applicable NAICS Code is 621112 ($10M). All responsible sources may submit quotes which shall be considered by the Agency. To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration data base at www.ccr.gov. CCR registration is free and potential offerors are encouraged to visit that CCR website and register as soon as possible to avoid delays should they be selected for a contract award.

(viii) The provision at FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors -Commercial Items, applies to this solicitation and is incorporated by reference. The addendum to FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors --Commercial Items - Sub-Part 13.5 Test Program also applies to this solicitation. This procurement is being conducted under the Subpart 13.5 test program where simplified acquisition procedures apply and the conduct of the procurement will be in accordance with Parts 12, 13 or 15 of the FAR or some combination thereof. 

(ix) 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items applies.  
 (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
1. Technical Capability.  The Government will evaluate how well the proposed system design meets the requirement as described in the specifications.  The Government will evaluate this capability on the basis of information obtained from the offeror, such as descriptive literature and the technical proposal.  The Government may also use any relevant information in its possession or in the public domain.  Ability to provide functions that are not required by the specifications but described as "preferred" may increase an offer's rating for this factor.  
2. Price.  The Government will evaluate the offeror's proposed price. 
3. Quality/Past Performance.  The Government will evaluate the offeror's reputation for quality and past performance.  By quality and past performance the Government means the offeror's reputation for conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror's reputation for adherence to contract schedules, including both technical and administrative aspects of performance.  The Government will evaluate quality/past performance on the basis of information that may be obtained from the offeror, such as previous commercial and Government contracts.  The Government may also use any relevant information in its possession or in the public domain.
4. Work plan.  Phasing of the work and schedule for completion are important factors that will be evaluated.  Production down time must be kept to a minimum.  Bidder's ability to keep the laundry up and running to the maximum extent is an important consideration.  Likewise, time is of the essence.  Bidder's ability to furnish and install the new equipment in a timely fashion is an important consideration as well.
(b) The individual factors are considered to be of equal importance; therefore the non-price factors of technical capability and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important when compared to price.  
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(x) 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items applies. A copy of the provision may be obtained from http://www.arnet.gov.far. 

(xi) 52.212-4, Contract terms and Conditions - Commercial Items applies.

(xii) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes of Executive Orders - Commercial Item applies.
