The VISN 9 Acquisition Service Center has a requirement to contract reference laboratory testing services for the VAMC Nashville, TN.  This procurement will be conducted under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2), Unusual and compelling urgency and FAR Part 6.302-1.  

A total of three Sources Sought Notices were released with no viable responses.  A LabCorp contract is currently in place for routine laboratory testing for the VAMC Nashville, TN.
The affiliate, Vanderbilt University is the only responsible source to meet the STAT turn-around time as required because of their close proximity and knowledge of specialized testing using staff familiar with VA procedures.  The NAICS code associated with this requirement is 621511 with a size standard of $13.5 million.  This Notice of Intent is not a request for Expressions of Interest (EOI), proposals, or quotations.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  No contract award will be made on the basis of EOIs, proposals, or quotations received in response to this notice.  This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, any company that feels they can meet the requirements may give written notification to the contracting officer 10 days from the date of publication of this notice.  Interested persons should furnish detailed data concerning their capabilities to provide services sought, including pricing data and technical data sufficient enough to determine that a comparable source to the government is available.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.  Information may be sent to Christina.Smith7@va.gov or via fax to (615)849-3789.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the Department of Veterans Affairs will proceed with a sole source award for the requirement to Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.
