<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Network Contracting Office (NCO) 16, Medical Sharing Division II, intends to publish a Request for Proposal to provide Readjustment Counseling for eligible Veterans in the Natchitoches, Louisiana geographical area.  The contractor would furnish (1) the facilities (within 50 miles of center of Natchitoches) and (2) the licensed clinical social worker(s) to provide readjustment counseling services to eligible veterans referred by Rapides Parish Vet Center.  The contractor will ensure that the facility is adequate to meet the criteria for providing services to the Veterans and includes private and confidential group and individual counseling areas.  These areas must be easily accessible to those physically challenged. 

Readjustment counseling, for purposes of this contract, is counseling provided by licensed social workers, individually or in groups, specifically directed at social, psychological, or behavioral difficulties specifically related to the post-war readjustment to civilian life.  Modalities of readjustment counseling include individual, group, and family counseling.

This service does not include general mental health services, but only provides readjustment counseling for psychosocial difficulties related to post-war readjustment form military duty for example:

a.	Exposure to combat-related war trauma
b.	Exposure to other aspects of war zone stress
c.	Post-traumatic stress disorder (as defined by DMS-IV) and/or other war-related social and psychological difficulties.
d.	Stressor unique to military duty for eligible veterans.
e.	Psychological concern over a possible service-connected condition.
f.	Substance abuse connected with military duty and/or post-war homecoming and readjustment.
g.	Difficult post-war experiences, including disrupted homecoming and unsuccessful reentry into civilian roles.
h.	Concern over possible Agent Orange, biological or chemical agent exposure or ramifications thereof.
i.	Generalized alienation from society manifested by lack of expectable familial, educational and/or vocational activities.
j.	Psychosocial difficulties related to type of military discharge for other than a dishonorable discharge. 

The provision of medications and physical examinations are not to be considered a component of readjustment counseling, and therefore, will not be provided under this contract mechanism.  Nonetheless, offerors should have the capability through referral to arrange for needed physical examinations, prescription medications and/or other medical treatment. 

The intended contract period will be for a base year starting 01 April 2014 through 31 March 2015 with two (2) option years.  Contract type will be an indefinite-delivery, indefinite quantity contract and will be solicited under authority of 38 U.S.C. 8153 and 38 U.S.C. 1712A, and will be procured under FAR Parts 12, 13 and VAAR 873.

The solicitation package will be available approximately on or about 05 February 2014 and should be downloaded from this website at that time. 

To be considered for award, the successful offeror must be a Small Business and registered in the System for Award Management, the primary registrant database for the U.S. Federal Government.  For registration information, please access:  https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.

Prospective offerors should not expect notification of issuance of amendments other than via the Federal Business Opportunities website and are responsible for obtaining all amendments as posted.  Prior to submission of a proposal, offerors are expected to read the solicitation documentation in its entirety to fully understand the scope of work, terms, and conditions of the requirement(s).

<DESC>The Chalmers P. Wylie Ambulatory Care Center located at 420 N. James Road, Columbus, Ohio 43219 intends to solicit proposal from contractors in the metropolitan Columbus, Ohio (Franklin County) area to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.  The VA anticipates issuing a solicitation for this requirement on or about January 30, 2014, with a closing date for proposals on or about February 12, 2014.  The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov.  Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of the solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies will be made available. The solicitation will provide full information to prospective offerors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments.
The goal of the HCHV program is to remove homeless Veterans from the street or habitation unfit for Veterans and place them in community-based, residential environments with sufficient therapeutic services to meet the needs of those Veterans. Through the HCHV program, VA provides case management services to Veterans and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental health, and rehabilitative services. The purpose of the solicitation will be to obtain proposals from contractors who can provide emergency beds, care, treatment and rehabilitative services to veterans suffering from serious mental illness, including veterans who are homeless, in community-based treatment facilities offering a safe and secure environment that supports their rehabilitation goals. The Contractor will be required to provide therapeutic and rehabilitative services, but will not be required to provide detoxification or other hospital level treatment - those services will be provided by the VA at VA facilities.  Due to the urgent nature of this requirement, contractors will be required to demonstrate their ability to provide services within a 2-week period after contract award.  Initial contract awards are expected to be on or about March 1, 2014.  Contracts will have a base term of 7 months, with four (4) one-year option terms exercisable in the discretion of the VA.  

NAICS Code is 624221 for (temporary shelters) and the solicitation will be issued for full and open competition. All responsible sources may submit proposals which shall be considered by the Agency.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) data base at www.sam.gov.  Registration is free and potential offerors are encouraged to visit the SAM website and register as soon as possible to avoid delays should they be selected for a contract award. Questions concerning this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist (Davina.Williams@va.gov) using the e-mail link provided. No phone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>This publication announces the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Headquarters, Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) plans to release the Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 version of the NASA Research Announcement (NRA) entitled, "Research Opportunities in Aeronautics (ROA), NNH14ZEA001N. Detailed requirements, including Proposal Due Dates will be stated in Appendices that address individual Thrust Areas. Appendices will be posted as Amendments to the ROA NRA and will be published as requirements materialize throughout the year. The FY 2014 ROA NRA (NNH14ZEA001N) can be accessed from the NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES) website, (<A HREF="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/">http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ </A>       ), by going first to "Solicitations", and then to "Open Solicitations". Once Amendments are available interested parties can access Open Solicitations, click on NRA NNH14ZEA001N, and then click on List of Open Program Elements. <p> Under the FY 2014 ROA NRA ARMD will continue solicitation of foundational and systems-level research proposals for five programs within ARMD: the Airspace Systems Program, the Aviation Safety Program, the Fundamental Aeronautics Program, the Integrated Systems Research Program, and the Aeronautics Strategy and Management Program. The Airspace Systems Program will directly address the Air Traffic Management (ATM) research needs of the Next Generation Air Transportation Systems (NextGen) initiative as defined by the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO). The Aviation Safety Program will take a proactive approach to safety challenges with new and current vehicles operating in the Nations current and future air transportation system. The Fundamental Aeronautics Program will pursue long-term, cutting edge research in all flight regimes to produce data, knowledge, and design tools that will be applicable across a broad range of air vehicles that fly through any atmosphere at any speed. The Integrated Systems Research Program will conduct research at an integrated system-level on promising concepts and technologies and explore/assess/demonstrate the benefits in a relevant environment. The Aeronautics Strategy and Management Program provides research and programmatic support that benefits each of the other ARMD programs. The program efficiently manages directorate functions including: Innovative Concepts for Aviation, Education and Outreach, and Cross Program Operations. The structure of the ROA NRA will require that proposals be submitted to the most relevant aeronautics program elements, which will be described in Appendices to the NRA. Specific Proposal submission deadline dates, any particular evaluation criteria, and submission points of contact will also be identified in the NRA Appendices. <p> With the exception of government organizations and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), participation is open to all categories of organizations, including educational institutions, industry and nonprofit organizations. Proposals must be submitted electronically, and all proposers may use NASAs proposal data system, NSPIRES ( <A HREF="http://nspires.nasaprs.com">http://nspires.nasaprs.com </A>	     ), or Grants.gov. Each electronic proposal system places requirements on the registration of principal investigators and other participants (e.g. co-investigators). Potential proposers and proposing organizations are urged to access the electronic proposal system(s) well in advance of the proposal due date(s) to familiarize themselves with its structure and enter the requested information. <p> Electronic proposals must be submitted by an authorized official of the proposing organization. Every organization that intends to submit a proposal in response to this NRA must be registered with NSPIRES, and such registration must identify the authorized organizational representative(s) who will submit the electronic proposal. <p> As topic areas are released further information about specific program elements will be available. The individual Program Officers and assigned Contracting Officers will be listed in the Summary of Key Information for each program element. Questions concerning general NRA policies and procedures may be directed to Susan Minor, Integration and Management Office Deputy Director, NASA Headquarters, Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, email: NASA-roa@nasa.gov. <p> This is a broad agency announcement as specified in FAR 35.016 and NFS 1835.016. <p> Notwithstanding the posting of this opportunity at FedBizOpps.gov, Grants.gov, or at both sites, NASA reserves the right to determine the appropriate award instrument for each proposal selected pursuant to this announcement. <p>

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for crew transportation services to and from the International Space Station (ISS). These services include launch, return, and rescue of U.S. or U.S.-designated astronauts and associated services, which include but are not limited to the following requirements for primary and ancillary services: <P> 	Training and training materials for the safe operation of the vehicle including necessary unique equipment and supplies <P> 	Astronaut and NASA designated support personnel access to the launch site with services to include launch operations and ascent control <P> 	Flight control operations, rendezvous and on-orbit docking services <P> 	On-orbit consumables, life support systems, and habitability services necessary during operations independent of the ISS <P> 	Search and rescue services, recovery at landing site, medical operations, NASA designated personnel access to the landing site and return transportation of the crew to the NASA delegation <P> 	On-orbit rescue services for the duration of the increment  	Rehabilitation post-flight, medical exams and services (on a contingency basis) <P> 	Associated crew cargo upmass commensurate with seat(s) purchased <P> 	Associated crew cargo returned commensurate with seat(s) purchased <P> NASA/JSC intends to contract with Roscosmos for these services on a sole source basis for six (6) Soyuz seats and associated services for calendar year (CY) 2017 with rescue/return services extending through spring 2018. NASA needs to secure crew transportation with a known reliability for the near-term to ensure a continued U.S. presence aboard the ISS until the sustained availability of a U.S. commercial vehicle. The intent of this proposed action is to provide the Government the ability to procure these services until an alternate U.S. provider demonstrates full operational capability. <P> NASA has established a goal to ensure there are U.S. domestic space transportation vehicle(s) capable of traveling to low Earth orbit and has also awarded Space Act Agreements and contracts with multiple U.S. commercial entities for the development of crew concepts, technology demonstrations, and investigations of future U.S. commercial support of space flights. The first crewed U.S. commercial demonstration flight is currently projected to occur in the fall of CY 2017.  Use of the commercial crew vehicle for increment crew transport will occur after successful demonstration.   <P> Therefore, these services are being procured through Roscosmos because the Soyuz is the only other proven crew transportation and rescue vehicle at this time period.  Until a U.S. commercial vehicle is sustained, continued access to Russian crew launch, return, and rescue services is essential for planned ISS operations and utilization by all ISS partners. <P> The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. <P> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 11, 2014.

<p>MSC requires professional engineering Contractor support to perform a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) study to determine a safe wastage allowance for the rails and associated supporting structure in accordance with commercial standards for the AS-39 5-Ton crane track on board the USS Frank Cable. The analysis shall be performed with the initial assumption that the rails and supporting structure are at 100%. Various wastage scenarios shall then be applied to the FEA model to iteratively show both deflections and stresses in the web, flange, and supporting structure of the rail system. Multiple iterations will be required to develop a robust database capable of predicting structural adequacy and deflections in various wastage conditions. The documentation of the existing structure is available but may not be sufficiently legible or detailed. It can be used to develop an initial FEA model, but a ship-check will be necessary to validate the structural details used in developing the FEA model. Also, during this ship-check, stress/strain testing will be required to validate the model. This requirement will be fulfilled through a firm-fixed-price task order. The period of performance will be approximately eight (8) months.</p>

The purpose of the award entails knowing the Navy operates and maintains several radio communication stations and several other similar facilities for various unique missions, including communication with strategic submarines, training aircrews and testing shipboard systems.
  Each of these stations and facilities have unique requirements for repair, maintenance and upgrading, as components wear out, as improved designs for components become available, and as mission requirements change. Often located at remote sites throughout the world presenting unique construction and engineering service difficulties, these stations often include large specialized antenna structures, utilize very tall towers, and require specialized power to operate.  These stations generally operate as dependent parts of a globally inter-connected communication system with similar facilities and related equipment at each remote site. As an integrated global system, it is often necessary to perform the repair, maintenance and upgrading of these individual stations and facilities considering their integrated global function.
The Government intends to award an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with pre-established labor rates for key personnel positions.

The Government may award up to three Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction MAC Contracts to the Offeror(s) whose proposal(s), conforming to the RFP, will be most advantageous to the Government considering tradeoffs between price and non-price factors. The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is $45,000,000. Task Orders will range between $10,000 and $1,000,000. Task Orders may fall below or above this limit; however contractors are not obligated to accept such Task Orders under the general terms of the contract.
Based on the requirements of each specific task order, the contractor shall provide construction and engineering services and all other tasking necessary to repair, modify, upgrade or build support equipment and facilities at one or more Low Frequency/Very Low Frequency LF/VLF communications stations and other similar locations.
 These requirements may include project development, concept development, design, engineering analysis, preparation of plans, writing of specifications, estimation of construction costs, fabrication, construction, and controlling quality, troubleshooting, overhauling old equipment, procuring new components, equipment installation and testing. 

The equipment and facilities under this contract are located throughout the world. The contractor shall be required to travel and ensure necessary resources are available to complete each task order.
When issued, the solicitation will be available in electronic media only and can be downloaded free of charge via the Internet World Wide Web at https://www.neco.navy.mil/under pre-solicitation notice N39430-14-R-1409.

Proposals may be submitted at any time during this period. This announcement replaces N39430-13-R-1233.
<p>FAR Part 35 restricts the use of BAAs to the acquisition of basic and applied research, and that portion of advanced technology development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement. Contracts made under BAAs are for scientific study and experimentation directed towards advancing the state of the art and increasing knowledge or understanding. This announcement is not for the acquisition of technical, engineering, or other types of support services.</p>
<p>This announcement seeks out technologies and methodologies to reduce environmental impacts from current and past Navy operations, and applies to Navy installations worldwide. NAVFAC EXWC is interested in environmental technologies and methodologies that are either new, innovative, advance the state-of-the-art, or increase knowledge or understanding of a technology or methodology.</p>
<p>The technology or methodology shall address one of the following topic areas.</p>
<p>TOPIC NO. 1: ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT, RESTORATION AND CLEANUP. Services to assess and/or remediate existing pollution generated by military operations, including methodologies for evaluation of ecological risk, risk reduction, and/or establishing risk based cleanup goals.</p>
<p>TOPIC NO. 2: CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES. Practices that support habitat both on land and at sea for rare and endangered species, migratory birds or marine mammals and that comply with environmental legislation and ensure protection of sensitive resources while supporting the military operations.</p>
<p>TOPIC NO 3: UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE (UXO). Services for explosive ordnance detection, location, de-energizing, disposal or remediation of UXO generated by military operations.</p>

<p>ABSTRACT SUBMITTALS TO THIS BAA CAN BE MADE USING THE ABSTRACT FORM and INSTRUCTIONS LOCATED AT THE FOLLOWING INTERNET ADDRESS: <br />http://www.navfac.navy.mil/navfac_worldwide/specialty_centers/exwc/products_and_services/ev/ec/baa.html</p>
<p>Submission process: This announcement is for abstracts/white papers only. Abstracts shall identify the specific topic area that the submission addresses. Each abstract must be specific to one of the topic areas. Multiple submissions are acceptable. Abstracts will be evaluated on relevance and merit. The abstract may be supplemented by resumes and lists of relevant publications and prior t.</p>
<p>Abstracts will be thoroughly evaluated by a Government Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) to select technologies and methodologies that have potential benefits to the Navy. The TEB will consist of engineers, scientists, chemists, environmental specialists, and regulatory agency personnel who have experience in specific environmental technology areas. The abstracts will not be evaluated against each other since each possesses a unique technology with no common work statement. Once the evaluation process has been completed, the abstracts that meet the basic criteria of the BAA are posted on a protected web site available for DoD use only. When an abstract aligns with a customer need and funding, the NAVFAC contracting office may request a full proposal. Additional guidance will be provided at that time, regarding cost and pricing submittals in addition to a more comprehensive technical submission.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation: Unsuccessful abstracts will not receive a detailed description of the reasons for abstract rejection due to the anticipated volume of submissions. Unsuccessful full proposals will receive a debriefing in accordance with FAR 15. Awards will be in the form of contracts. Government/FFRDC/UARC entities interested in responding should read NOTE 8 below. An average contract duration is one (1) to three (3) years.</p>
<p>The abstracts will be evaluated based on the following. Factors (1), (2) and (3) are approximately equal, and when combined, are approximately equal to (4). Factors 1-4, when combined, are approximately equal to price:</p>
<p>1. The scientific/technical merits and objectives of the abstract, as well as Naval relevance.</p>
<p>2. The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the principal investigator, team leader, and/or key personnel who are critical in achieving the objectives of the abstract. Principle Investigators and key personnel should be identified in the proposal as such.</p>
<p>3. NAVFAC requires the offeror to provide their EMR and DART ratings. Safety is an integral and important part of NAVFAC contracting. If the offeror does not have an EMR/DART rating, they should state this and provide the rationale. See NFAS 15.304.</p>
<p>4. The contractor's capabilities related experience, techniques, or unique combination of these that are integral factors in achieving the contractor's proposed objectives. This equates to past performance, and will be assessed based on both relevance and confidence. See NFAS 15.304.</p>
<p>5. The cost relative to the proposed scientific/technical approach.</p>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>1. An eligible abstract does not guarantee a contract. NEXWC reserves the right to select for award any, all, or none of the proposals received. NEXWC also reserves the right to select for award a portion of the work proposed in any single proposal.</p>
<p>2. An Offeror is required to register with the system for award management (SAM). No contract award will be made to any offeror that is not registered. Registration may take up to three weeks. SAM may be accessed at HTTPS://WWW.SAM.GOV.</p>
<p>3. The preceding data should be sufficient for completing the abstract.</p>
<p>4. There are no solicitation documents applying to this BAA. Request for a solicitation package will not be acknowledged. Those interested in participating in the BAA program must follow the instructions described herein to submit an abstract.</p>
<p>5. There is no commitment by the Navy either to make any contract awards or to be responsible for any money expended by the offeror before a contract award.</p>
<p>6. As no funding for contracts has been reserved in advance, NEXWC will be sharing qualified abstracts with other Federal Government activities to seek demonstration sites and/or funding. Some Federal Government activities may employ civilian contractors to determine the applicability of an offered technology to specific environmental projects. Technical and cost proposals submitted under this BAA will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 3.104-4 and 15.207. The cognizant Program Officer and other Government scientific experts will perform the evaluation of technical proposals. Restrictive notices notwithstanding, one or more support contractors may be utilized as subject-matter-expert technical consultants in accordance with FAR 37.204. However, proposal selection and award decisions are solely the responsibility of Government personnel. Each support contractor's employee having access to technical and cost proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be required to sign a non-disclosure statement prior to receipt of any proposal submissions. An offeror may require the non-government personnel to execute a supplemental non-disclosure agreement by including a copy of the NDA with their proposal. However, note that a failure to come to an agreement may impact the ability to make an award. Please review NFAS / FAR 37.204 and NFAS 15.303(d)(4).</p>
<p>7. Responders are advised not to include Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Business proprietary or competition-sensitive information shall be marked as such. The offeror should expect to receive notification of receipt of the abstract by the Government within one week of submission. If the contractor does not receive a notification of abstract receipt, the contractor should call or e-mail NEXWC by using the phone number or e-mail address provided.</p>
<p>8. Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI) will be recognized according to DFARS 226.3. All responsible sources from academia and industry may submit proposals. No portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation, due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable items of this research for exclusive competition among the entities. Non-DOD Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) including Department of Energy National Laboratories, are not eligible to receive awards under this BAA. However, teaming arrangements between FFRDCs and eligible principal bidders are allowed so long as they are permitted under the sponsoring agreement between the Government and the specific FFRDC. DFARS 235.017-1 allows DOD FFRDCs which function primarily as research laboratories to apply. Naval laboratories and warfare centers as well as other DOD and civilian agency laboratories are not eligible to receive awards under this BAA and should not directly submit an abstract response to this BAA. As with the FFRDCs, these organizations may team with other responsible sources from industry and academia that are submitting proposals under the BAA. University Affiliated Research Centers (UARC) are eligible to submit proposals under this BAA unless precluded from doing so by their DOD UARC contract or an organizational conflict of interest.</p>
<p>9. Do not call the Contracting Office for verification. The abstract is not received by the Contracting Office. General contracting inquires may be directed to the FEDBIZOPS posting POC.</p>

<ARCHDATE>04102014
<CONTACT>Greta N. Perry

<a href="mailto:Perry.Greta@epa.gov">perry.greta@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, with Horiba Instruments, Inc. to provide a Particulate Matter (PM) Measurement System in Vehicle Site 5 located at the National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), 2565 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105.
The vehicle site 5 test site is based around an existing test control and data acquisition system (test cell host computer) that represents a significant investment by the government.  There are no plans to replace this system.  This CDTCS 5000 test cell computer system performs many complex functions, among them is communication related to control of, and data acquisition from, an existing ?Horiba Instruments MEXA analytical system.  The test cell host computer utilizes a specialized and unique set of drivers and command structure required by a Horiba-propriety host communication protocol, MEXA-LAN.  Incorporation of a new communication protocol in the existing test control and data acquisition system would be required with any other PM measurement system and would require significant additional investment by the government.  Replacement of the test host computer would complicate test control of the Horiba ?MEXA gaseous analytical and constant volume sampling systems.  Furth er, replacement of the test host computer system in this test site is neither anticipated nor desired, and would jeopardize a critical EPA regulatory mission by extending the implementation date for Part 1066 testing.
With regard to this specific procurement, in order for another vendor to be responsive to the solicitation they would have to provide a PM measurement system that responds to the same, extensive, set of computer commands that the Horiba ?MEXA system responds to.  This set of commands is part of the proprietary Horiba MEXA-LAN network protocol.  This protocol is associated with Horiba proprietary software imbedded in Horiba MEXA system microprocessors.  Use of this imbedded software by another supplier in their products would be infringement upon Horiba intellectual property. In building complete test cell systems that utilize Horiba MEXA equipment, integrators utilize the MEXA-LAN protocol and command set to program their test-cell control and data acquisition computers in order to interact with MEXA exhaust gas analyzers.  The test site that will utilize the analysis system obtained by this procurement is run by an existing test-cell control and data acquisition computer custom programmed by NVFEL staff.  Since the current PM measurement system being procured is also a Horiba product, the existing test site computer already uses the MEXA-LAN command set and communication structure in its own software.
The vehicle testing this procurement supports involves a complex series of actions and events that take place over a specific time frame or ?test cycle.?  The test-cell control and data acquisition computer has the complex task of coordinating the entire test process.  Some examples of this task include:
?	Collecting operator input which configures the test for the engine to be tested ?	Vehicle operation over a prescribed series of speed ?	Issuing commands to various pieces of test equipment, including the exhaust analysis system before during and after testing ?	Monitoring equipment for fault conditions and taking appropriate actions ?	Collecting data from several pieces of equipment and sensors continuously during the test ?	Processing a large data set after the test to calculate, report and transmit results
In addition to engine tests, the test-cell control and data acquisition computer must perform similar functions on a periodic basis to conduct various diagnostic tests required by regulation.  These tests are conducted in order to demonstrate the validity of engine test results.
For some equipment that the vehicle test-cell control and data acquisition computer interacts with, the command and/or data acquisition function is quite simple.  This is not the case for the exhaust PM measurement system since there are many different actions the analysis system performs in response to commands from the test-cell control and data acquisition computer, and many different data variables that the measurement system communicates back to the test-cell computer.  These tasks utilize serial communication throughout the test, to issue function commands, pass information and data back and forth and to monitor the analysis system for proper functioning.  As a result, a specific communication structure for commands and variable names, in this case MEXA-LAN, is utilized throughout the custom software of the test-site computer system.  There are no plans to replace this test-cell control and data acquisition computer and changing this software would entail considerable c ost to the government in the form of labor to rewrite debug and completely validate new software at the test site. This would also result in concurrent loss of test function during the implementation process, impacting critical test schedule functions. This procurement will be accomplished using FAR Part 12 and 13 Procedures.  Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit documentation to the office identified above.  Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice.  Submit your documentation in writing to Greta Perry by e-mail to perry.greta@epa.gov.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.</p>
<p>The 22d Contracting Squadron (22 CONS) of the 22d Air Refueling Wing is conducting market research to determine the availability, interest and capability of potential small business sources qualified and able to compete for a contract to perform Hangar Door Maintenance services requirements at McConnell AFB, Kansas. The information in this notice is based on the best and most current information available to date. This information is subject to change and is not binding to the Government. Updated information will be provided in future announcements and posted electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) homepage at www.fbo.gov. The Government shall not reimburse the costs of preparing responses to this request for information / sources sought notice.</p>
<p>The 22d Contracting Squadron (AMC), McConnell Air Force Base (AFB), Kansas, intends to issue a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) in the May/June 2014 timeframe (approximately) for the acquisition of Hangar Door Maintenance services to be performed at McConnell AFB. The estimated contract period including all options is 1 October 2014 through 30 Sep 2019. The successful contractor shall provide all management, tools, supplies, equipment, labor, transportation, supervision and any other items and services necessary to perform Inspection, Preventive Maintenance, and Repair Services for Aircraft Hangar Doors, Tail Doors, Overhead Doors, Hoists, and Cranes, for McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, commercial practices, and manufacturer's specifications as described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) with emphasis placed on safety and customer service. The contractor is expected to use innovative solutions to effectively accomplish PWS requirements in a timely manner at reduced costs and in a way that fosters pride and ownership in the services performed. All work shall be performed in accordance with all federal, state, and local regulations, commercial standards, and the terms and conditions specified within the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The NAICS code for this requirement is 811310, Commercial and Industrial Machinery and Equipment (except Automotive and Electronic) Repair and Maintenance.

<p>22 CONS is interested in quantifying and pre-qualifying the likelihood of setting aside competition for Hangar Door Maintenance services for McConnell AFB to a small business. Depending upon the response to this notice and other market research, 22 CONS may limit the competition to a specific category of small business at the exclusion of all other potential business concerns. This announcement serves as a first step for 22 CONS to determine the viability of setting aside the procurement of Hangar Door Maintenance services for competition solely within or among certain small businesses in selected categories. This is a Sources Sought announcement only; no solicitation exists or is available at this time. Requests for a solicitation shall not receive a response.</p>
<p>This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. In the event a solicitation is developed, it will be assigned a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) number and the announcement will be published on the FedBizOpps website at www.fbo.gov. Potential interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package as well as downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments, if any.</p>
<p>AFFARS 5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (NOV 2012)</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the Center/MAJCOM/DRU or AFISRA ombudsmen, Mr. Gregory Oneal, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, email: gregory.oneal@us.af.mil.

Fort Hood exists to train its assigned units, as a mobilization station for Army Reserve and National Guard units and as a strategic power projection platform. The installation serves a wide variety of tenant organizations and ensures the highest quality of life support for a diverse community of over 297,000 soldiers, family members and retirees. With 45,414 assigned soldiers or airmen and 8,909 civilian employees, Fort Hood occupies 340 square miles of Bell and Coryell Counties, 60 miles north of Austin, 50 miles south of Waco, 160 miles south of Dallas, and 150 miles north of San Antonio. Seven surrounding cities with a regional population of 335,000 are partnered with and provide substantial quality of life support to Fort Hood. The Army has consistently demonstrated its commitment to long term infrastructure improvements at Fort Hood. These include 98 new or renovated barracks, state of the art command and control facilities, the 21st-century Krueger Soldier Development / Education Center, the one stop Copeland Soldier Service Center, an aggressive range modernization program and modern Installation support facilities. The Installation encompasses 214,968 acres; 136,094 acres are used for maneuver, 63,000 acres as a Live Fire Impact area and 15,874 acres for the installation's Cantonment Areas.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY <br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>This is a sources sought to determine the availability and capability of small businesses to provide on-site pathology services. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is&#8208; 541990 All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services; Small Business Size Standard is $14.0 million.</p>
<p>Part I: General Information</p>
<p>Background: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR), Office of Scientific Coordination has a requirement for pathology services in support of FDA's mission. NCTR is located at the Jefferson Laboratories of the FDA in Jefferson, Arkansas, approximately 35 miles south of Little Rock and 28 miles north of Pine Bluff. NCTR is an internationally recognized FDA research center that conducts toxicological research studies and other research activities designed to support the FDA's mission to protect the public's health. NCTR investigators collaborate with researchers elsewhere in the FDA as well as other government agencies, industry, and academia. FDA/NCTR and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) have had an interagency agreement (IAG) since 1992, through which the FDA collaborates with the National Toxicology Program (NTP) to design and conduct toxicological studies involving compounds of regulatory interest to the FDA. Many of the studies at NCTR must follow the FDA's Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) guidelines. NCTR is comprised of six research divisions and has facilities including: 132 general or special purpose research laboratories; Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)-accredited animal facilities, including, but not limited to, rodent facilities accommodating conventional housing, specific pathogen free rodent production colony, isolators for germ-free rodents, and quarantine; a non-human primate research center; a zebrafish production facility; a phototoxicology research center; an imaging center including microPET, MRI, and CT scanner; a nanotechnology core facility; and an inhalation toxicology facility.</p>
<p>Historical Information: On-site pathology services for the animal studies performed at NCTR have been obtained through contracts since the Center's inception in 1972, and most currently by Toxicological Pathology Associates, Inc. (TPA) under a cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract. The existing workforce performing the services consists of approximately forty (40) employees made up of both professional and service employee positions. In 2011, 2012, and 2013, the number of studies per year with pathology requirements was 48, 76, and 64, respectively. At any given time, pathology services are being conducted on approximately 10-15 different studies. The majority of pathology studies are conducted on rodents; however, some studies involve non-human primates, other mammals, and/or zebrafish. Facilities, property, and utilities have historically been government-furnished. A complete list of GFP will be included in any resultant solicitation.</p>
<p><br />Part II: Work Requirements Summary<br /><br />Brief Scope: NCTR requires on-site pathology services, for a base period plus up to four (4) 1-year option periods, on various animals in, but not limited to, the following areas: 1) necropsy and gross pathology; 2) histology; 3) pathologist services; 4) clinical chemistry; 5) immunohistochemistry and special procedures; 6) molecular pathology; 7) digital imaging; 8) data management; 9) archive management (wet tissue and block/slide); 10) quality assurance; 11) quality control; and 12) administrative services and management. The Contractor shall conduct the pathology services on each study to the requirements/parameters established by the NCTR Principal Investigators (PIs). The Contractor shall work closely with the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and PI to plan, implement, perform, report and archive the research protocols. Planning includes, but is not limited to, developing cost estimates, schedules, and work plans to be performed for each study. Research protocols written by the PIs will determine the pathology support requirements, which may range from necropsy and collection of a few tissues of only a small number of animals to complete necropsy (collection of &ge;44 tissues) of over a thousand animals requiring special handling of tissues, histopathology, special staining or other techniques (immunohistochemistry, digital imaging, etc.), hematology, urinalysis, and/or clinical chemistry. Other requested techniques may include, but are not limited to, teratology techniques, respiratory pathology techniques (inhalation toxicology studies), sperm morphology and motility analysis, vaginal cytology, vaginal smears for sperm evaluations, and mammary whole mounts.</p>
<p>Estimated Period of Performance:</p>
<p>Base Period: November 1, 2014 through October 31, 2015<br />Option Period 1: November 1, 2015 through October 31, 2016<br />Option Period 2: November 1, 2016 through October 31, 2017<br />Option Period 3: November 1, 2017 through October 31, 2018<br />Option Period 4: November 1, 2018 through October 31, 2019</p>

<DESC>NASA/LARC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for REPLACEMENT OF COMPRESSORS 1, 2 and 3 in BUILDING 1247E AT NASA LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER in HAMPTON VIRGINIA <p> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking capability statements from interested parties, including Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-Owned (WOSB), Veteran-Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran-Owned (SD-VOSB) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The Government reserves the right to issue any upcoming solicitation as a Large, Small, SDB, 8(a), WOSB, SD-VOSB, or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto. <p> Two North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes may apply to this procurement.  The first is 238220, Industrial process piping installation, with a size standard of $14 million dollars, and the second is 236210, addition, alteration and renovation, general contractors, industrial building (except warehouses), with a size standard of $33.5 million dollars. <p> PROJECT DESCRIPTION: <p> NASA LaRC is seeking firms capable of the procurement, installation and activation of industrial service equipment.  The Center is looking for firms with construction capabilities and relevant project experience as defined below for a project at LaRC to replace 3 of the 6 existing compressors in Building 1247E with a single, larger compressor.  The effort contemplated has an estimated value of more than $10,000,000.00. <p> Responding firms shall address capabilities and past experience related to capabilities in coordinated field construction of industrial mechanical, electrical and controls systems to facilitate the replacement of compressors #1, #2, and #3 (Clark CRA reciprocating compressors, each 2.5 lb/sec @ 5,000 psi) and associated foundations and ancillary air drying, back pressure control, power, coolant, lubricant, air, vent and instrumentation systems; with one 8 lb/sec (minimum) compressed air system, including replacement (partially or completely) of the oil-water separator (OWS) and condensate floor drain systems. LaRCs compressors are a component of the High Pressure Air Production and Distribution (HPAPaD) system and provide compressed air to support 25 research facilities from a series of storage tank fields. The goals of this project are to obtain reliable performance and operation, improved maintainability and improved on-line availability by utilizing industry proven equipment and operation techniques. This is intended to be a turn-key system based on proven technologies utilizing off the shelf systems and components.  The new compressor system shall consist of a centrifugal compressor that feeds a dryer that feeds a reciprocating compressor and shall have a design life expectancy of 30 years. Although LaRC expects to operate the compressor 1,000 hours per year, the compressor shall be designed to perform per normal industry standard (continuous operation). Currently, compressors normally operate on weekdays for 8-12 hours during the day and are turned off for the remaining 12-16 hours. The new compressor system shall provide 6,000 psig air at a minimum flow rate of 8 lb/sec and shall provide air at an atmospheric dew point of -80F. The new OWS system shall process the total volume of oily water discharge from the new compressor and the 3 additional existing compressors. The new compressor shall be designed to afford room for personnel to perform routine and expected maintenance without removal from the Compressor Station. Ergonomic designs shall be incorporated where possible. These construction services require the ability to perform coordinated and integrated field construction in an operational environment while observing NASA-specific operational, safety and environmental processes.  Critical expertise includes the construction of mechanical pressure and piping systems; construction of structural support systems; electrical installation of feeder, regulation, conditioning and control systems; integrated control systems installations for local and distributed industrial process control systems; environmental remediation within existing facilities; and demolition of existing systems within active industrial facilities.	The proposed project specifically requires that the offeror source equipment vendors and work with those vendors to develop and provide equipment control and instrumentation systems that integrate wholly with the existing plant and campus distributed controls systems at LaRC.  The offeror will be further required to activate the systems and demonstrate the functional integration and performance of these systems under a wide range of operational conditions and situations.  Specific professional skills required include schedule management, procurement of materials and services, job site safety and environmental management, quality control management and subcontractor coordination. <p> Relevant project experience is defined as: <p> 1.  Procurement, installation and activation of complex industrial process systems. 2.  Development, procurement, installation and activation of distributed industrial control systems. 3.  Operational and/or maintenance experience with large, complex industrial process systems. 4.  Large scale complex construction or renovation projects involving numerous subcontractors including a demonstrated ability to schedule, coordinate and manage multi-faceted projects. 5.  Execution of construction projects at sites with continued operational activities during construction that demonstrate limited impact to continuing site operations. 6.  A demonstrated commitment to safety, health and environmental protection during the execution of construction projects. <p> In order to ascertain the method of procurement for the construction services outlined above, interested firms are invited to submit a CAPABILITY STATEMENT ADDRESSING THE ABOVE AND SHALL ALSO INCLUDE, but not limited to the following: name and address of firm; size of business; average annual revenue for the past three (3) years and number of employees; ownership, whether your firm is a Large Business, Small Business (SB), 8(a), HUBZone SB, Woman-Owned SB, Veteran-Owned SB, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned SB; number of years in business; affiliate information; parent company; joint venture partners; potential teaming partners; prime contractor (if interested as a potential subcontractor); list of customers covering the past three (3) years (highlight relevant project experience, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement and points of contact with addresses and phone numbers).  Capability statements shall be no longer than ten (10) type-written, single-sided pages. <p> In addition, interested large business firms are requested to submit their proposed recommendation for Small Business Subcontracting Plan Goals for each category (Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned, HUBZone, Veteran-Owned, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)) in the event a procurement for this effort is conducted via full and open competition. Please advise if this requirement is considered a commercial item or commercial-type service.  A commercial item is defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101.	Any questions you may have are to be submitted in writing, via email, to be used for consideration in the development of the requirements.

<p>The government knows of no other known sources of supply at this time. The Government has no rights to the data that would be required to support development by another company. Any attempt to reproduce this item from any other source other than Baron Services, would require that the Government re-qualify the part at considerable cost to the Government whose cost saving could not be recovered. This is a time sensitive requirement and any delay in procuring this part will impart the Radar Operations in the event of a failure. These items are being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS), NEXRAD program, to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO. The intended procurement is for supplies for which the Government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). The unique characteristics and physical form of these items make them the only acceptable parts. Because the design is the intellectual property of Baron Services, the Government does not have access to the specific design features. The Government has no design rights to the items and does not possess the drawings that specify the parts. The NAICS code for this requirement is 334220. The proposed contract action is for services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by closing date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and to provide the supplies. Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on the technical ability and demonstrated past experience to meet the requirements described in the description section above. Interested persons should identify their interest and capabilities to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. Information must can be emailed to Sharon.walker@noaa.gov or sent via fax at 757-664-3845.

<DESC><p>FBO Notice NAFNDW-14-R-0004</p>
<p>MWR, a component of the Warfighter &amp; Family Readiness (WFR) program at Naval District Washington (NDW), is a comprehensive network of quality support and leisure services that enhances the lives of Service members and their families, Civilians, Military Retirees and other eligible participants that are affiliated with the Department of Defense (DoD). Our mission is to foster and support high productivity for our DoD audience through mental and physical fitness, personal growth, and a sense of community, positive values and Family well-being.</p>
<p>MWR is comprised of over 50 activities ranging from fitness centers to libraries, child development programs and youth activities to single service member programs and business operations such as special events, dining, bowling and clubs. These facilities and programs support mission readiness, personnel retention, and overall quality of life for our sailors, airmen, retirees, civilians, and their families. MWR has been and will continue to be a key contributor to DoD's mission of ensuring there is a ready and able military force by providing quality of life enhancing opportunities.</p>
<p>NDW MWR is initiating a new entertainment program called Freedom Live. Although the Navy MWR Organization provides a variety of entertainment for our eligible customers, the talent is typically comprised of local entertainers that are not considered headliners. Freedom Live intends to fulfill the desires of our eligible audiences by providing the highest level of entertainment for a more economical price. The exciting opportunity will target the first 5,000 customers from the total DoD eligible population of 406,000 within the National Capital Region for a large concert at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling. A second event will occur at NAS Patuxent River, MD and target 2,500 eligible DoD customers within Southern Maryland. Although the event dates are still being determined, we anticipate this entertainment to occur in the late summer or early fall of 2014. Once this program is fully established, it is expected to remain at peak maturity for an extended period of time and will expand to multiple events throughout the National Capital Region going forward.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to identify Marketing Firms that are interested in seeking out companies, on behalf of MWR, that may be interested in sponsorship opportunities and in showing support for our nation's military personnel. It is anticipated that non-exclusive revenue sharing (cash sponsorship percentage based) services contracts with one or more Marketing Firms will be issued. All cash sponsorship received would be via a Sponsorship Agreement between the Host Installation and the entity providing the sponsorship in accordance with Navy Sponsorship regulations. <br />For inquiries or questions regarding this unique opportunity, please contact Ms. Dawn Sykulla at 202-767-4846 or dawn.sykulla@navy.mil. MWR looks forward to speaking with you further about this opportunity.</p>

<DESC>The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) seeks information on human-portable spectroscopic radiological/ nuclear detection and identification systems in support of the government's Human Portable Tripwire (HPT) program. To assist Industry in responding to this RFI, the following information is provided:
<p>&bull; HPT Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM). Attached is the Draft HPT RTM, V0.16, dated September 25, 2013 which defines the HPT's operational and corresponding functional requirements. A subset of the RTM requirements are designated as "Priority" to highlight the requirements deemed more important by the DHS Operational Components. Specific requirements are designated as "Maritime Only" based on the projected need for a Maritime HPT system, in addition to a Baseline HPT system. The Baseline HPT system will provide gamma detection while the Maritime HPT system will provide additional neutron detection capability and be utilized in a more stringent maritime operational environment (See RTM for detailed requirements).</p>
<p>&bull; HPT Interoperability White Paper. Attached is an HPT Interoperability White Paper, V1.0, dated September 25, 2013 which provides additional context to explain the communications and functionality requirements for the HPT system during reach-back operations.</p>
<p>DNDO will hold a telecon to answer questions on this RFI. The telecon is currently scheduled for November 14, 2013, 1300-1400 EST, dial in information will be provided to responders of this RFI.</p>

Investigative efforts found no other companies with the unique understanding of Health Services research methods and the ability to work with and train a variety of health care professionals (e.g. nurses, nursing assistants, other healthcare deliverers).   Market research of GSA vendors indicated there were vendors who provided training, but as this current study is a follow-on effort to a previously conducted pilot study, it is essential for data integrity to keep the same vendor.  Changing vendors for the current study would render useless the data and results obtained from the pilot study.  No advantage would be gained through competition.  The nature of the harm to the Government such as invalidation of the results of the pilot study would not be overcome through any price or delivery benefit that could possibly be obtained through competition.
  
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The anticipated cost will be considered fair and reasonable upon the following basis: 
a prior contract with the Boston VA Healthcare system (VA241P1833) for similar services was executed for a pilot study EDU 08-427 "Training and Coaching to Promote High Performance in VA".  The total cost of that award was approximately $XXX and included 4, 3-day training sessions.  The current requirement includes 2 separate training sessions, follow-on teleconferences, and coordination of trainee selection.

Therefore, within the meaning of FAR 13.106, a comparison with past awards indicates the price for this new work will be fair and reasonable.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Similar training programs may be available from GSA but this new project is a follow-on to the pilot study.  Changing vendors for the follow-on study would negate the results of the original study and render invalid (for comparison purposes) any results from the follow-on study. PHI wrote the original curriculum and participated in the original pilot study.  Current requirement is based upon the results and success of original pilot study.  To change vendors and curriculum now would render useless the previous success and results.  The current need is based upon the success and results of the original pilot study.   PHI is a nationally recognized organization providing the direct care health worker training.  In addition, the success of their training programs and training methods has been substantiated through prior VA research pilot study and a previous contract with the Boston VA Healthcare system.  The training that PHI will provide is trademarked by PHI. 

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  PHI was specifically named in the research grant proposal and awarded funding by the VA Office of Research and Development (ORD) through the VA Health Services Research and Development (HS&RD) Office and has the support of the VA Medical Research Appropriations. The requirements cannot be modified to enhance competition, as they are determined as a result of a peer-reviewed grant proposal process. Altering the requirements would change the intent and validity of the research project. 

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  No other contractors have the expertise to provide the services requested.  PHI is the sole source provider on this research project because of their expertise in training for the direct-care workforce and the work done under the pilot study.  Their methods and training materials are proprietary.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  VA Health Services Research and Development (HSR&D) Service and the Principal Investigator continue to monitor requirements and developments in the marketplace.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:
VHA's Non-VA Medical Care Program allows VA to refer eligible Veterans to non-VA providers for health care related services when VA cannot provide the necessary services due to the capacity of VA, the nature of the services required, the geographic availability of such services and the emergent need for services. When VA refers an eligible Veteran to the community for non-VA medical care, the non-VA providers bill VA for their services rendered. These bills are submitted to the referring VA facility via Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) as a HIPAA compliant transaction or through the mail via paper invoice on a CMS 1450 or CMS 1500. When claims are received by the local VA medical center or consolidated payment center they are input into VA's claims processing system and processed by administrative staff for payment to the appropriate health care provider. The claims processing activity requires general knowledge of health care billing and Veteran eligibility for non-VA medical care. CBOPC provides procedure guides and SOPs for the processing of claims. 

PURPOSE:
VA/VHA/CBOPC intends to contract with vendor(s) that can provide assistance with processing health care claims as a result of aged claims inventory nationwide.

This support would include processing the aged claims inventory, as well as providing continuous support, as necessary, to prevent any more aged claims. 

WRITTEN RESPONSES:
Please provide a brief explanation on any experience you have regarding the below systems. Provide these responses via email, in a Microsoft Word Document, to Brandon.Maness@va.gov.  Responses are due 12PM Mountain, 3 February 2014.

1.	What is your company's ability to perform all VA functions for processing medical (current or Aged) claims?
2.	Is your company familiar, and have actual experience, with the Fee Basis Claims System (FBCS)?
3.	Is your company familiar, and have actual experience with, the processing of claims specific to Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA)?
4.	Is your company familiar, and have actual experience, with the VA Fee Authorization Process?
5.	Is your company familiar, and have actual experience, with the Computerized Patient Records System (CPRS)?

A.	General Information

1.	Project Title:  VistA Evolution Workgroup Coordinators Contract

2.   Background:  
Health Systems Informatics (HSI) is an organization in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Office of Informatics and Analytics (OIA), Health Informatics (HI) which works collaboratively with other VHA Program Offices and OIA components to ensure VHA Information Technology (IT) business needs are accurately identified, documented, and submitted to the VA Office of Information and Technology (OIT) for development and implementation.  
Through the Health Systems Portfolio Management (HSPM) team (Fig 1), HSI serves as the primary contact with VHA business owners, users, and other stakeholders in visioning future business environments and associated business needs.  These business needs are then captured through a collaborative effort with OIA Strategic Investment Management (SIM) (Fig 2) that includes the business needs being expressed in new service requests.  HSPM supports the SIM in finalizing New Service Requests (NSRs).  NSRs are requests for products, product enhancements and changes to information systems that OIT develops and maintains. Requests for New Services are received from a variety of customers. Prioritization of VHA's NSRs through Capability Management Boards will be a new process to ensure greater VHA business owner and field input to the disposition of NSRs.  These requests identify problems and opportunities that can be answered with Information Technology (IT) solutions and enhancements.  HSI staffs serve as advocates, facilitators and liaisons to the business owners and review business requirements to address business issues within IT applications/systems used by VHA staff and ensure traceability.  Additionally, HSI is responsible for providing OIA and its SIM counterparts input into the capabilities management/prioritization activities to assist with ensuring the IT development projects that are most important to VHA, are funded first.  HSI works collectively with SIM to provide key input to current and future business needs; assist in gathering, documenting, analyzing, and evaluating clinical and business requirements; and continues its advocate/liaison/facilitation role to address business needs throughout the project lifecycle.
HSI typically works with individuals throughout VA Central Office (VACO), Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs), Department of Defense (DoD), other Federal Agencies and the private sector. In addition to interacting with VHA stakeholders, HSI regularly interfaces both with OIA stakeholders and with program and project managers within VA OIT, as business requirements move through the project/system lifecycle and finally sustainment.  VA System Lifecycle Management emphasizes a decision process that incorporates Concept Definition, Concept Planning, Development, Implementation, Operations and Maintenance and Closeout, in addition to system cost, funding, prioritization, effectiveness and efficiency. HSPM will focus increasingly on VHA engagement and readiness for Initial Operating Capability (IOC) testing, deployment and national implementation of IT systems and products used by VHA.  The VA OIT provides technical solutions to business requirements identified by the Veterans Health Administration.  Health Systems Informatics (through HSPM) represents the VHA in the identification and acquisition of technology enhancements and health information strategies that will improve veteran's services.

The tasks associated with this contract focus on supporting the Interagency Program Office (IPO).
In 2009, President Barack Obama charged the Departments of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Defense (DoD) to establish a concurrent method by which active and retired Service members could access their health records.  Specifically, the Departments were called upon to, "work together to define and build a seamless system of integration so that when a member of the Armed Forces separates from the military, he or she will no longer have to walk paperwork from a DoD duty station to a local VA health center.  Their electronic records will transition along with them and remain with them forever."
The Interagency Program Office (IPO) was created in October 2011 to lead the Departments in this effort and to develop and implement an integrated electronic health record capability to better serve Service members, Veterans, and other eligible beneficiaries.  In FY2013, the Secretaries of VA and DoD made decisions that resulted in changes to the implementation of the iEHR program. The first shift occurred in the second quarter of FY13. Upon recognition of the cost increases and risks the Departments were facing should they remain on the current implementation path, the two Secretaries announced, on February 5, 2013, that the Departments would accelerate the delivery of iEHR through focus on near-term interoperability goals that could be achieved in calendar year 2013 . 
The IPO is programmatically responsible for managing and delivering the seamless sharing of interoperable health data between the Departments. The DoD is programmatically responsible for managing and delivering its EHR modernization program named DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM). The VA is programmatically responsible for managing and delivering enhancements to VistA under the VistA Evolution Program. Both Agencies' future electronic health record systems are required to be consistent with the proposed VistA Evolution Program technical architecture principles established by the IPO, to ensure seamless interoperability.
The VistA Evolution Program will utilize or leverage previously completed development work to replace the aging VistA Web and other EHR viewers with a single viewer that supports the VA/DoD interoperability efforts. Important technical advances will be made including: methods to create and store coded observations from the point of care, terminology services that provide translation, indexing to aid text search, and other tools to better integrate terminology across all domains. 
3.   Scope of Work:  This contract will provide the necessary program support to Health Systems Informatics in the expanding activities associated with standing up numerous EHR functional capabilities related to the VistA Evolution Program.  Support services are needed to manage actions items, meeting agendas, follow-up requirements, tracking deliverables due by vital suspense dates and overall coordination duties.   

The contractor shall provide strategic health information professional and technical services to the Program lead for Health Systems Informatics.  The contractor shall provide project and program management services to support these team leaders in the management of the VistA Evolution Program. The contractor shall also support the Leads in reporting.   The scope of work and work products include requirements resourcing, prioritization decision support, sequencing coordination, Enterprise Architecture concepts, Business Models, project management constructs and strategic planning. This task order/contract will provide support to the activities associated with standing up and monitoring progress of the VistA Evolution Program capabilities as well as provide Health Systems Informatics with Workgroup Coordination Support in the form of program management, resource management, Electronic Health Record and subject matter expertise to help strengthen and improve OIA's ability to support VA's joint role with the Department of Defense in designing and creating an interoperable Electronic Health Record.  

Specific deliverables and tasks within the Health Systems Informatics VistA Evolution Workgroup Coordinators Contract will directly impact the delivery of health care by revisions to the current architecture and business model of health software development, lead to development of specific software products that will revise the concept and delivery of health record information, and increase the knowledge base and participation by clinicians regarding health informatics and the development of health information technologies.

The DCFM developed under the JCA Demo will not become the basis of any subsequent program activity, but knowledge gained will be used as input to the Government's planning processes.  Processes, tools, and lessons learned are more important than component performance. <br>  <br> 2.  Background <br>  <br> The Aviation & Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is currently developing an open system architecture (OSA) definition for the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) family of systems (FoS) under the JCA Science and Technology (S&T) effort.  JCA is following the Modular Open System Approach (MOSA) principles and leveraging existing and emerging OSA related efforts (including the Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACETM) consortium).  JCA in its final form will comprise a model, guidance documents and an ecosystem.  JCA version 1.0 is not projected to be available until the end of FY15; however, it is the Government's desire to perform a proof of concept demonstration starting in FY14 with a partial version (V0.X). <br>  <br> The JCA Program has five overarching program goals:  <br>  <br>      Increase affordability <br>      Reduce time to field <br>      Enable new technology integration <br>      Accommodate mission performance requirements <br>      Address applicable mandates <br>  <br> JCA defines a software product line (SPL) which consists of key interfaces as well as the software components of an avionics system that can be reused across the entire FVL FoS.  This enables the achievement of higher level Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) affordability goals that would not automatically be achieved if developers or Program Offices worked independently.    <br>  <br> In following the MOSA principle of establishing an  quote mark enabling environment, quote mark  the JCA S&T effort teamed with the Navy and Industry to stand-up an open, consensus based, standards body.  The Open Group managed FACE Consortium is an Industry and Government partnership to establish a standard Common Operating Environment (COE) for capability-based applications across Department of Defense (DoD) avionics systems.  FACE standards, documentation, tools, and processes form the basis of JCA wherever possible. <br>  <br> JCA will comprise the following:  <br>  <br>      JCA Model - The JCA Model represents a collection of existing widely used and Industry-accepted standards, the reference architecture, and supporting documentation.  The JCA Reference Architecture is a conceptual framework identifying a set of avionics subsystems, avionics components, their interfaces, their allocated functionality, common semantics and composition rules at the Domain, Subsystem, and Component levels. <br>  <br>      Guidance Documentation - The Guidance documentation will cover Security/Information Assurance, Contracting, System Safety and Airworthiness, and Systems and Software Engineering. <br>  <br>      Ecosystem - The Ecosystem will utilize efforts developed within the FACE Consortium and Army/Navy FACE Academic Project to provide the simulation tools, integrator and developer toolkits, conformance testing tools, a repository of JCA artifacts, and a reference application. <br>  <br> 3.  Detailed Topic Description <br>  <br> SOLICITATION TOPICS:  There is one topic under this announcement.   <br>  <br> TOPIC: JMR Technology Demonstrator Joint Common Architecture Demonstration (JCA Demo) <br>  <br>   3.1.  Overview <br>  <br> JCA Demo seeks to achieve the following goals: <br>      Verify the JCA concept by: <br>      o  Procuring products defined by JCA V0.X in a representative acquisition process <br>      o  Developing a JCA component utilizing the Ecosystem <br>      Reduce risk for subsequent JMR TD efforts by: <br>      o  Understanding the level of effort (resources, cost, and schedule) required to implement <br>      o  Estimate potential benefits for the FVL FoS <br>  <br> JCA Demo will achieve these goals by procuring a software component defined by the JCA Model and verify that it is: <br>      Modular - Functionality scoped and defined by JCA Model V0.X <br>      Portable - Executes on a common Operating Environment (OE) conformant to the FACE Technical Standard ed. 2.0 <br>      Interchangeable -External interfaces are open and defined using FACE data model <br>  <br> The JCA Demo will procure a software component built to the same specifications from multiple vendors.  The Government will integrate and compile each software component to operate on multiple OEs.  The demonstration will consist of executing a common scenario for each software component on each OE in the lab.  While the performance of each software component on each OE will be evaluated, the goal is to verify the JCA concept, not procure the most functional software component.  <br>  <br>    3.2.  Technical Description <br>  <br>          3.2.1.  Software Component <br>  <br> The software component to be procured under this BAA is a Data Correlation & Fusion Manager (DCFM) defined as a FACE Technical Standard ed. 2.0 Portable Component Segment (PCS) Unit of Portability (UoP).  This software component was selected based on available Government resources and is generically defined with a minimal set of functionality for demonstration purposes.  The DCFM UoP is being developed specifically for laboratory use and therefore has no airworthiness requirements (Design Assurance Level-E) despite being restricted to the FACE Safety Profile.  The DCFM UoP is specified through a combination of textual descriptors and a data model provided in the  quote mark Supplemental Package. quote mark   See  quote mark Section 9.1 Instructions to Offerors quote mark  on how to obtain. <br>  <br> DCFM UoP developers SHALL provide behavior and performance characteristics of the DCFM UoP to the government throughout the development process. <br>  <br>          3.2.2.  Operating Environments <br>  <br> Each OE consists of an ARINC 653 FACE Security Profile partition with FACE IOS & TSS Layers on a General Purpose Processor (GPP).  The DCFM UoP will be allocated at least 384 MB of RAM and 20% of the GPP (minimum GPP operates at 1 GHz). <br>  <br>         3.2.3.  Candidate FACE Tools <br>  <br> The Government seeks verification of the Candidate FACE Tools.  Since the FACE Technical Standard continues to evolve and the tools are constantly being updated to reflect the changes, the intention is to utilize the latest version available at contract award. <br>  <br> The Candidate FACE Tools are available at https://face.isis.vanderbilt.edu/. <br>  <br> DCFM UoP developers SHALL use the FACE Modeling Tools with the supplied DCFM Data Model to generate the data type and component files to produce the DCFM code set files. <br>  <br> DCFM UoP developers SHALL use the FACE Conformance Test Suite to verify conformance of the DCFM. <br>  <br> DCFM UoP developers SHALL submit issues to the Candidate FACE Tools through the  quote mark New issue quote mark  page on the Candidate FACE Tools website. <br>  <br> 3.2.4.  Reusable Verification <br>  <br> To perform verification of the DCFM UoP on each OE the Government requires a Reusable Verification Component (RVC) that consists of a platform agnostic software test harness (e.g. software test fixture), platform agnostic automated test scripts (e.g. Python), and the necessary documentation (e.g. test cases and operator instructions.)  The RVC provides the full suite of capabilities required to perform a verification that the DCFM UoP operates as intended and satisfies its software requirements while executing within each OE. The RVC captures the input conditions (parameters, ranges, sequences, etc), expected results (pass/fail criteria), and traceability data which maps RVC test cases to their corresponding DCFM UoP software requirements. This ensures compatibility with the host hardware and provides verification of the platform integration as life-cycle changes are made to each OE. <br>  <br> 3.2.5.  FACE Verification <br>  <br> DCFM UoP developers SHALL demonstrate how the DCFM UoP meets the requirements of the FACE Technical Standard ed. 2.0.  The Government will perform the functions of a FACE Verification Authority.   <br>  <br> DCFM UoP developers SHALL deliver preliminary FACE verification evidence, an initial FACE Verification Package, and a final FACE Verification Package. <br>  <br>  <br> 3.2.6.  Government Lab <br>  <br> For this demonstration the Government will serve as the Systems Integrator with all supporting equipment and personnel resident at the Aviation Systems Integration Facility (ASIF) on Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.  The government lab will include a software developer's workstation with all the necessary C/C++ compilers for the FACE Safety Profile OS's selected.   <br>  <br> DCFM UoP developers SHALL support Government lab integration efforts and FACE verification activities via voice and/or web based communication up to 80 hours. <br>  <br> 3.2.7.  Proprietary Information <br>  <br> Government Support Contractors will be used in the lab to perform the integration tasks.  DCFM UoP developers need to address any proprietary tools or software items and address mitigation strategies (e.g. non-disclosure agreements) within the technical proposal.  Government support contractors are currently covered by a non-disclosure agreement in connection with the AMCOM Express contract.  A copy of this non-disclosure agreement is available upon request.  DCFM UoP developers may enter into an additional proprietary information agreement with Government support contractors at their option.       <br>  <br> 3.2.8.  Lessons Learned <br>  <br> DCFM UoP developers SHALL participate in regularly scheduled meetings to discuss development progress as well as lessons learned relevant to the JCA concept and FACE products.   <br>  <br> DCFM UoP developers SHALL identify airworthiness implications that would need to be addressed if the DCFM UoP were targeted for a safety-critical implementation. <br>  <br> 4.  Data Rights <br>  <br> The Government requires sufficient Data Rights and Licensing for the DCFM UoP and any additional aspects (e.g. COTS libraries) that enable integration of the DCFM UoP on the target OEs during the course of the JCA Demo effort and other future Government experimentation.  Future experimentation may include, but is not limited to, integrating on additional OEs, upgrading hardware components, replacing FACE software components (OS/IOS/TSS/PCS), testing data model scalability/extensibility, and virtual integration into different systems architectures/designs.   <br>  <br> Offeror's SHALL document all aspects of Technical Data, Computer Software, and Computer Software Documentation in Section 9.3  quote mark Proposal Volume II - Technical Data and Computer Software Rights volume quote mark  and Section 9.5  quote mark Proposal Volume IV - Cost. quote mark    <br>  <br> 5.  Funding Level And Performance Period <br>  <br> Anticipated funding will vary based on proposed approach. This topic is expected to result in multiple awards.  Total funding available for all awards is anticipated to be $800K.  Any award is subject to the availability of funds.  The Period of Performance will begin at award and last for eight (8) months.  Delivery of the DCFM is expected within four (4) months of award with the remaining time for integration support and report generation. <br>  <br> 6.  Funding Instrument <br>  <br> The instrument preferred by the Government is a Technology Investment Agreement (TIA) (Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358), which is more flexible than traditional Government funding instruments.  This does not preclude other funding instruments from being used.  A variety of funding instruments are available pursuant to this announcement depending upon the proposed effort, the entity submitting the successful proposal(s), and statutory and regulatory requirements the Government must satisfy.  Such instruments include conventional Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented, and Other Transaction (OT) for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371).  In accordance with the DoDGARS, Parties proposing to carry out a research project under a TIA are asked to provide at least half of the costs of the project, to the maximum extent practicable.  This is a statutory condition for those TIAs under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371, and is a matter of DoD policy for all other TIAs.  The purpose of the cost share is to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in the project's success.  Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions, where cash is considered of significantly higher quality in demonstrating commitment to the project.  Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DoD 3210.6-R paragraph 34.13 (Cooperative Agreement) (but also see paragraph 37.530 pertaining to Other Transactions for Research) accessible at the following link: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321006r34p.pdf.  Contract type is a subject for negotiation, but the Offeror's desire should be clearly stated in the cost proposal. <br>  <br> 7.  Security Requirements <br>  <br> Performance may require access to and/or generation of technical data, the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec. 2751 et. seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, (Title 50, U.S.C.

Fold-out illustrations required for reader ease are allowed, however, illustration shall be counted in 8   quote mark  x 11 quote mark  increments (e.g., a 11 quote mark  x 17 quote mark  document will count as two pages). <br>  <br> 10.  Evaluation Factors for Award <br>  <br> The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on a scientific and/or engineering evaluation of proposals (technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement.  Each proposal will receive an adjectival rating supported by narrative.  The ratings and narratives will be used to develop an order of merit listing.  Proposed cost will be evaluated for realism and reasonableness. <br>  <br> The following evaluation factors apply:  <br>     <br> 10.1.  EVALUATION FACTOR I - Technical Approach and Processes <br>  <br> The Government will evaluate the Offeror's ability to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the complete range of tasks, requirements, and goals set forth in the Topic Description and Supplemental Package.  The Government will evaluate the Offeror's: <br>  <br> 10.1.1.  Approach to accomplishing the tasks and requirements set forth in the Topic Description and Supplemental Package. <br>  <br> 10.1.2.  Proposed software development process and associated tools. <br>  <br> 10.1.3.  Approach to meeting the requirements of the FACE Technical Standard for the DCFM UoP and plan for developing and providing FACE Verification Evidence. <br>  <br> 10.2.  EVALUATION FACTOR II - Technical Data and Computer Software Rights Factor <br>  <br> In evaluating the Data Rights and Patent Rights, the Government will use information in the proposal to assess the extent to which the rights in Technical Data (TD), Computer Software (CS), Computer Software Documentation (CSD), and Inventions/Patents offered to the Government ensue unimpeded, innovative, and cost effective development, operation, maintenance, and upgrade of the DCFM UoP throughout its life cycle. <br>  <br> Proposals will not be rated less than ACCEPTABLE on this factor solely because an Offeror does not offer a price for the Government Purpose Rights Option CLIN. However, ratings on this factor for proposals to deliver TD, CSD, or SW with less than the minimum rights specified for the Government by applicable statute (10 U.S.C. 2320) and regulation (DFARS 252.227-7013, 252.227-7014, and 252.227-7015) may be negatively impacted. For non-commercial acquisitions, these rights include: Unlimited Rights in TD (as specified in DFARS 252.227-7013(b)(1)) and CS and CSD (as specified in DFARS 252.227-7014(b)(1)); Limited Rights in TD (as specified in DFARS 252.227-7013(b)(3)); and Restricted Rights in CS (as specified in DFARS 252.227-7014(b)(3)). The minimum rights considered for TD associated with commercial item acquisitions are specified in DFARS 252.227-7015(b)(1). For commercial FACE software acquisitions, evaluation of the offered rights will assess their consistency with Federal procurement law and satisfaction of Government user needs in accordance with the policy in DFARS 227.7202-1(a). <br>  <br> Ratings on this factor for proposals to deliver TD, CSD, or SW with more than the minimum rights specified for the Government by applicable statute and regulation may be positively impacted. <br>  <br> 10.3.  EVALUATION FACTOR III - Technical Experience and Qualifications <br>  <br> In assessing the Offeror's past performance, the Government will evaluate the relevant past performance examples(s) (e.g., experiences, contracts and subcontracts) which demonstrate the following: <br> 10.3.1.	The Offeror's previous experience with open architecture, Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA), MOSA and/or FAE within the last five (5) years. <br>  <br> 10.3.2.  The Offeror's previous experience in successfully developing data fusion, data correlation, or similar software for embedded avionics systems. <br>  <br> 10.3.3.  The Offeror's previous experience in successfully developing software for real-time safety-critical embedded systems. <br>  <br> 10.3.4.  The Offeror's previous experience in successfully developing software using machine readable data models. <br>  <br> 10.3.5.  Qualifications, suitability, and availability of key personnel performing the proposed work. <br>  <br> 10.3.6.  Qualifications, suitability, and availability of facilities to perform the proposed work. <br>  <br> 10.4.  EVALUATION FACTOR IV - Cost  <br>  <br> 10.4.1.  The Government will evaluate realism of the proposed man-hour, material, and other costs to accomplish the proposed effort (see FAR 2.101 -  quote mark Definitions, quote mark  Cost Realism).  Costs to the Government of any required GFE/GFI of facilities will also be included in the evaluation. <br>  <br> 10.4.2.  The Government will evaluate the following costs with respect to how they impact further use of the DCFM UoP. <br>  <br> 10.4.2.1.  Supplemental Information Concerning Cost/Price of Noncommercial Technical Data (TD), Noncommercial Computer Software (CS), and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation (CSD) <br>  <br> 10.4.2.2.  Supplemental Information Concerning Cost/Price of Commercial Computer Software (CS) and Commercial Computer Software Documentation (CSD) and Commercial Technical Data (TD) <br>  <br> 10.4.2.3.  Supplemental Information Concerning Cost/Price of Background Inventions  <br>  <br> Evaluation Factors are ranked from most important (I) to least important (IV). <br>  <br> 11.

<SUBJECT>FDIC ISC2 IT Infrastructure Support
<SOLNBR>GST0009AJM094_Ceiling_Increase
<CONTACT>Victor B. Angkico, Contracting Officer, Phone (703) 226-9179, Email victor.angkico@gsa.gov
<DESC>GSA FEDSIM intends to increase the ceiling of the current Infrastructure Support Contract (ISC2) task order (GS00T99ALD0211/GST0009AJM094) in support of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Department of Information Technology (DIT). This task order was competitively awarded to SRA International, Inc 4300 Fair Lakes Court, Fairfax, VA 22033 in September 2009. The ceiling increase modification will utilize the procedures of FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The proposed modification ceiling increase will raise the total task order amount from the current ceiling of $563,894,206, to an amount deemed necessary to cover services under the current and final option period for six months from March 1, 2014 to August 31, 2014.
<p>The ISC2 covers the day-to-day operation of FDIC's infrastructure facilities, hardware, software, and systems. ISC2 currently supports 11,757 IT users and 1,159 servers. It primarily supports Operational Security, Client Support/Help Desk, Data Center Operations, Asset Management, and Systems Engineering service areas. ISC2 directly provides the support activities that facilitate FDIC's delivery of software applications by managing the underlying infrastructure, supporting release management, and providing operations and maintenance of the Development, Quality Assurance, Testing, Production, and Disaster Recovery environments. In addition to providing IT administration, management and provisioning services for all FDIC locations, it also provides a mechanism to facilitate the procurement of IT hardware and software resources to meet corporate goals of rapid response during emergencies. The services provided by this task order are a critical component of FDIC's capability to respond to banking surge activities in a timely and secure manner.</p>
<p>FEDSIM competitively awarded the follow-on contract to ISC2 (ie. ISC3) on August 14, 2013 utilizing the GSA Alliant GWAC vehicle. As a result, FEDSIM and FDIC anticipated transition completion prior to the expected current ISC2 ceiling exhaustion date of October 31, 2013; however due to the receipt of subsequent post-award protests, there will be insufficient ceiling to maintain continuity of operations until a successful transition can be executed from ISC2 to ISC3. Due to the time to resolve the current protest, this ceiling increase request is projected to cover costs through the end of the ISC2 period of performance on August 31, 2014.</p>
<p>SRA International is the only contractor who can ensure continuity of services with the minimal risk to the Government during this period as they have the infrastructure and staff already in place under an existing task order whose current option does not expire until August 31, 2014. The Government is legally precluded from having these services performed by any other contractor until final resolution of the current&nbsp;protest.</p>
<p>The final Justification &amp; Approval supporting this sole source action will be publically made available as required after contract modification award.</p>

<DESC>SINGLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a single source purchase order to procure replacement parts to rebuild and restore a Model 105 End-fire Glide Slope (EFGS) System. This is a brand specific system manufactured only by WATTS Antenna Company located in Herndon, Virginia.

WATTS Antenna Company will deliver the parts identified in the Item List to rebuild a Model 105 End-fire Glide Slope Antenna System. This is a ground-based instrument approach system that provides precision guidance to an aircraft approaching and landing on a runway, using a combination of radio signals to enable a safe landing during instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), such as low ceilings or reduced visibility due to fog, rain, or blowing snow. A glide slope is an independent sub-system which provides vertical guidance to aircraft approaching a runway. A glide slope (GS) antenna array is sited to one side of the runway at the touchdown point and its signal is transmitted on a specific carrier frequency.

This fixed price purchase order will be issued at an estimated amount of $187,000.00 with delivery due within six months after award.

This procurement will be conducted under the guidelines of the FAA Acquisition Management System. This policy allows, when it is in the best interest of the Government, for single source procurement, AMS Policy Section 3.2.2.4.

End-Fire antenna is the only antenna approved for NAS deployment which can accommodate terrain where image-type antennas do not work properly. End-Fire is a brand name and there are no substitutions approved for NAS deployment. This is a Re-build for restoral purposes of an existing Model 105 End Fire Glide Slope Antenna System.

The procuring office for this contract is the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), FAA Contracting Office, Southern Region AAQ-510, 1701 Columbia Ave, College Park, Ga 30337. This announcement is for informational purposes only, not a solicitation or request for proposal. A full and open competition is not available for this procurement.

<SUBJECT>--Grand Teton National Park Expanded Telecommunications
<SOLNBR>P14PS00288
<CONTACT>
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The National Park Service is requesting information regarding the availability and feasibility of expanding cellular and broadband access to specified locations within the Grand Teton National Park (GRTE) and John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway (JODR). Services include both wired (fiber optic) and wireless communications infrastructure. Wireless services coverage in GRTE/JODR is required ONLY for specified locations, and should use best available technology to provide coverage using unobtrusive infrastructure appropriate for a national park renowned for its scenic landscapes. New wired service would provide the long haul capacity for the wireless services, as well as National Park Service owned & operated fiber optic infrastructure. Wired service extending through the JODR is also expected to continue into Yellowstone National Park and provide a basis for further wired and/or wireless infrastructure in Yellowstone Park. Exhibit 1 provides further detailed information on infrastructure requirements to interested vendors. Exhibit 2 provides a diagram indicating the location of specified locations in GRTE and JODR.
For this RFI, the National Park Service is interested in determining whether or not potentially new, current, and future domestic service providers are interested in pursuing the identified expanded telecommunications services; and in determining new or emerging techniques or equipment that may allow economically viable telecommunications infrastructure expansion under the special conditions (climate, environmental compliance and aesthetics) of Grand Teton National Park.
Process: This request is to gather information from interested parties and is deemed essential as part of our collaborative, deliberate planning process for the National Park Service in expanding the commercial and government telecommunications services in Grand Teton National Park and Yellowstone National Park. Interested parties should review the attached documents and reply no later than April 1, 2014.
Disclaimer: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI will be treated as business confidential information, and exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Nonetheless, submitters should properly mark their responses if the information is confidential. Response to the RFI will not be returned. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expense associated with responding to this RFI. 'This Request for Information does not in any way imply a planned or pending procurement action by the United States government, nor does it supersede provisions of federal law or National Park Service policy for obtaining telecommunications rights-of-way.'

<DESC><p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to award a fixed-price purchase order on a single source basis to Intelligize for subscription to Intelligize's online database. The subscription is required by the SEC to search SEC Staff Comment Letters, No Action Letters, and M&amp;A Research. Intelligize uniquely provides the capability of filtering searches for these documents by data form group and many other filters and iterative searches that narrow the search results. The contracting officer has determined that Intelligzie is the only source that can reasonably meet the SEC's requirement in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(b).<br /><br /><br />The period of performance for the purchase order is anticipated to be one (1) Base Year and three (3) Option Years and the total value of the order shall be below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.</p>
<p><br />The SEC intends to award a purchase order to Intelligize on or about January 31, 2014. This notice is not a competitive request for proposals. A competitive solicitation will not be issued. However, the government will give consideration to interested parties that identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals by the response date of this notice.</p>

Once eligible systems have been identified, additional information will be requested at a later date. For the purpose of this RFI, the term man-portable cellular system is defined as a complete multi-user communication system that may be transported by one person to a location that does not have operating cellular connectivity, either due to remoteness of locale or commercial cellular service outage.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Authorized Equipment List (AEL) item number for this equipment is AEL# 06CC-01-CELL: Cellular Phone.  The target audience for this information is the emergency responder community, and all submittals should be suited to their specific needs.  Review of this information is being performed for the DHS System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responders (SAVER) Program, which aims to conduct objective comparative assessments and validations of commercial equipment and systems and provide those results to the emergency responder community.  For more information on the SAVER Program please forward enquiries to ssc_lant_saver_program.fcm@navy.mil.  All information received will be treated as public knowledge and may be used in SAVER Program documentation; therefore, vendors should not submit proprietary information in response to this RFI.  Specific information sought includes:  1. Company information, including name, address, and website; 2. Whether the company is a manufacturer or distributor; 3. A point of contact for follow-up information, and the point of contacts phone number and e-mail address; and 4. System name/model.  The submitted information will be evaluated for inclusion in SAVER projects. If a SAVER project on this type of equipment is executed, the equipment selection will be based upon a number of factors including emergency responder surveys and responder focus group inputs.  Consequently, follow-up requests for feedback should not be made through the Federal Business Opportunities posting agency.  Vendors will be contacted following submission for more detailed product information.  Vendor provided information may be reformatted for publication in SAVER Program documents.  Submittals  Respondents are required to complete the attached form (Man Portable_Cellular_Systems_RFI.pdf) and follow the instructions on the first page of the form.

<p>b.

<p>(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below);or<br />(iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a) (2) below).</p>
<p>(2) The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.</p>
<p>If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue the work not terminated.</p>
<p>a. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods,<br />(5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and; (9) unusually severe weather.

<p>c. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.</p>
<p>d. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.</p>
<p>e. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>

HOLD AND SAVE HARMLESS (JAN 2005) - The Contractor shall indemnify, hold and save harmless, and defend the NAFI, its outlets and customers from any liability, claimed or established for violation or infringement of any patent, copyright, or trademark right asserted by any third party with respect to goods hereby ordered or any part thereof.

<p>c. Notwithstanding any provisions of this clause or any payment made pursuant to the terms of this clause prior to receipt of the items contracted for, the NAFI retains the right to inspect upon receipt and the right to reject nonconforming items. The liability of the Contractor with respect to items for which payments have been made will, after inspection by the NAFI or after the expiration of a reasonable time following delivery to the NAFI within which inspection may be made, whichever occurs first, be limited to (i) exceptions taken at the time of inspection, and (ii) latent defects, fraud, or such gross mistakes as amount to fraud.</p>
<p>19. COMMERCIAL WARRANTY (JAN 2005) - The Contractor agrees that the supplies or services furnished under this contract shall be covered by the most favorable commercial warranties the Contractor gives to any customer for such supplies or services and that the rights and remedies provided herein are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the NAFI by any other clause of this contract.

<p>21. DISCOUNTS FOR PROMPT PAYMENT (JAN 2005)</p>
<p>a. Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the evaluation of offers. However, any offered discount will form a part of the award, and will be taken if payment is made within the discount period indicated in the offer by the offeror. As an alternative to offering a prompt payment discount in conjunction with the offer, offerors awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on individual invoices.</p>
<p>b. In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified payment date. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day.</p>
<p>22. INVOICES (JAN 2005):</p>

Invoices shall be prepared and submitted in duplicate (one copy shall be marked "Original") unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>b. For purposes of determining if interest begins to accrue under the PROMPT PAYMENT ACT (PUBLIC LAW 97-177):</p>
<p>(i) A proper invoice will be deemed to have been received when it is received by the office designated in the contract for receipt of invoices and acceptance of the supplies delivered or services rendered has occurred.<br />(ii) Payment shall be considered made on the date on which a check for such payment is dated.<br />(iii) Payment terms (e.g., "Net 20") offered by the contractor will not be deemed required payment dates.<br />(iv) The following periods of time will not be included:<br />(A) After receipt of improper invoice and prior to notice of any defect or impropriety, but not to exceed three days for meat and meat food products, five days for perishable agricultural commodities, and 15 days in all other cases, and<br />(B) Between the date of a notice of any defect or impropriety and the date a proper invoice is received.

<p>25. NON WAIVER OF DEFAULTS (JAN 2005) - Any failure by the NAFI at any time, or from time to time, to enforce or require strict performance of any terms or conditions of this contract will not constitute waiver thereof and will not affect or impair such terms or conditions in any way or the NAFI's right at any time to avail itself of such remedies as it may have for any breach or breaches of such terms and conditions.</p>

<p>B. Pricing Information. <br /><br />(1) Schedule B Submission<br />a. Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered unacceptable and consequently, a reason to reject an Offeror's proposal. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br /><br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as "Not Separately Priced" by entering "NSP" in the unit price.

Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br /><br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal being rejected.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)<br />(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br /><br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br /><br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B) Satisfactory Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence - No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br /><br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>B. Pricing Information. <br />(1) Schedule B Submission<br />a. Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing.

Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as "Not Separately Priced" by entering "NSP" in the unit price.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)<br />(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence - No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of Offeror's process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B) Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them.

Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

The enterprise must meet these requirements throughout the following time periods: (1) At the time an offer is made in response to a written solicitation; (2) At the time of contract award; and, (3) During the full term of the contract. Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, regional or village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601). Representation means the positive statement by an enterprise of its eligibility for preferential consideration and participation for acquisitions conducted under the Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47, in accordance with the procedures in Subpart 1480.8. (b) General. (1) Under the Buy Indian Act, offers are solicited only from Indian economic enterprises. (2) BIA will reject all offers received from ineligible enterprises. (3) Any award resulting from this solicitation will be made to an Indian economic enterprise, as defined in paragraph (a) of this clause. (c) Required Submissions.

(e) Non-responsiveness. Failure to provide the information required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this clause may cause Indian Affairs to find an offer non-responsive and to reject it. (f) Eligibility. (1) Participation in the Mentor-Protg Program established under section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (25 U.S.C. 47 note) does not render an Indian economic enterprise ineligible for contracts awarded under the Buy Indian Act.

The notification must include full disclosure of circumstances causing the contractor to lose eligibility status and a description of any actions that the contractor will take to regain eligibility.

SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICE/COSTS
 
 This is a basic ordering agreement for the period of one year from the date of award with four (4) one (1) year options, in accordance with FAR 16.7.    A contract is formed, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this agreement, when VA agrees to place a patient in the nursing home and the nursing home agrees to accept the patient.  Upon acceptance by the contractor of beneficiaries of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), all terms and conditions of this agreement shall apply during such time as a VA patient remains in that nursing home at the expense of VA.
 
 Upon acceptance of a VA patient by the nursing home, if and when requested by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative, the contractor shall furnish all supplies and services herein described, at the per diem rates for the levels of care specified below.  VA levels of care are defined in Section D of this agreement.  VA is obligated only to the extent authorized placements of patients are made under this agreement.
 
RATE DETERMINATION
 
 The per diem rate is established by the current Medicaid rate for Medicaid approved nursing homes plus a fair market amount (percentage) to cover the cost of supplies, services, and equipment above that provided under Medicaid established by the local state Medicaid agency (SMA).  Rates established after the effective date of this agreement will require a modification to the agreement.  

 VA shall use Medicaid rates for room, board, and routine nursing care.
 
 For all levels of nursing care a percentage is added for routine ancillary services/supplies, such as drugs, nursing supplies, oxygen (occasional use), x-ray, laboratory, physician visits, and rental equipment.
 
 Special equipment, e.g. clinitron bed, is/are not considered routine ancillary services (and may be provided by the VA).
 
 Drug costs which comprise more than eight and one-half percent (8.5%) of the per diem rate are generally not considered routine ancillary supplies (and may be provided by the VA).
 
 Rehabilitation therapies shall be provided as a distinct level of care.  Hospice Care and Dialysis are not included in the rate.  VA or other payers shall be used for Hospice and Dialysis, as determined by the veteran with VA approval.
 
ORAL MEDICATIONS
 
 Oral medications, which comprise more than 8.5% of the per diem rate on a monthly basis, are excluded from that rate.  High drug costs shall be determined or priced using the Average Wholesale Price (AWP) of the drugs plus a transaction fee of 3% per month.  All calculations shall be made on a monthly basis.  When a high cost drug patient is identified, VA staff must be advised promptly to establish an appropriate course of action, which shall include the provision of the medications by VA.
 
 ANCILLARY COSTS
Ancillary cost are pre-approved costs for supplies or services not identified as included in the all-inclusive rate or any other pre-authorized rate or schedule or payment for items or services provided under this agreement.  Ancillary costs such as medications, special equipment, rehabilitation therapies, shall not be added to any invoice without written permission of the VA medical center placing the veteran.  If permission is received, the nursing home must also submit the physician's order for the medication/supply, the dispensing log, the supplier and the cost charged by the supplier to the nursing home, and what the nursing home is charging the VA.

DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK
 
   B.1. This Basic Ordering Agreement shall be conducted under the procedures of FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13.5. The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well-being of VA patients.  Nursing home care shall be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psycho-social needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, X ray, and other special services for VA patients shall be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided shall include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) established in this BOA shall include the cost of medical care, drugs, laboratory, x ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically excepted.
 
   B.2. Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living, to the maximum extent possible.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
 
   B.3. Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, shall be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility shall be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and shall be obtained within 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA facility shall be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
 
   B.4. If a veteran is re-hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility shall arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the patient and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days shall be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but shall not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations.  Payment shall follow state Medicaid regulations.  The VA facility shall include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the conditions above are met.
 
   B.5. the VA facility shall approve leave days (days away from the nursing home) for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a therapeutic plan and approved by VA.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year.  Payment shall follow state Medicaid regulations.  Exceptions shall be approved by the VA facility director or designee.
 
   B.6. Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, shall be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility shall be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center shall be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
 
  
 B.7.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this BOA dies, the nursing home shall within 48 hours notify the VA office  authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects pending further guidance by VA.
 
   B.8. It is agreed that VA shall have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
 
   B.9. The nursing home shall accept referral of and shall provide all services specified in this BOA for any person determined eligible by the VA Under Secretary for Health or his/her designee, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex, or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting shall not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.
 
   B.10. It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA shall provide follow up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back to the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute for nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.
 
   B.11. All medical records concerning the veteran's care in the nursing home shall be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records shall be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records shall be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient that includes at least the following:
 
     B.11.1. Admission identification record.
 
     B.11.2. VA Form 10 1204, Referral for Community Nursing Home Care, or State-approved referral form.
 
     B.11.3. Admitting evaluation (including diagnosis by nursing home physician).
 
     B.11.4. Physician orders.
 
     B.11.5. Progress notes.  The physician orders/notes shall be charted immediately after patient is seen.

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

Factors are listed in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>The Government will award the purchase order to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) Technical capability of the items/services offered to best meet or exceed the Government requirement<br />(ii) Past Performance<br />(iii) Price</p>
<p>Non-price factors (Technical and Past Performance), when combined, are significantly more important when compared to price in determining the best value to the Government; however, price remains a significant factor.</p>
<p>Technical capability will be determined and evaluated by review of information submitted by the offeror, which must provide sufficient technical information necessary for the Government to conclusively determine that the offered services meet the technical requirements identified above. Offerors shall specifically address the minimum performance requirements stated above as well as technical specifications, descriptive material, literature, brochures and other information which demonstrates the capabilities of the offeror.<br />Past Performance will be determined and evaluated by the identification of federal, state, local Government, or private contracts for which the offeror has, in the past three (3) years, for which the offeror has provided the same service for use in same or similar applications.

Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (NOV 2013)</p>

If the Contractor certifies that the company is exempt under the terms and conditions of 52.222-48, then clause 52.222-51 will be applicable to the resulting order.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>
<p>(3) Advice as to whether the inability to perform may adversely affect national security, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation.</p>

<p>(2)(i) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract and the lack of performance will adversely affect national security, the total amount of the monies collected that should be returned to the Contractor; or</p>
<p>(ii) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract but will not impact national security, a recommendation that the Contractor promptly notify the IRS to attempt to resolve the tax situation.</p>

been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally   
such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you
are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the  
information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS)

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation is being posted in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6) and FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
This posting is requesting items using a brand name description.  Products offered other than those specifically referenced by brand-name in this posting will not be accepted.  The use of such descriptions in this acquisition is essential to the Government's requirement, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.
In support of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of the Administrator (OA), the Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) intends to make a one-time supply purchase with a delivery date of no more than 10 days after receipt of order (ARO).  Additional warranty service plan coverage need not be provided.
The NAICS code for this combined synopsis/solicitation is 423410, PHOTOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES MERCHANT WHOLESALERS with a small business size standard of 100 employees.  This requirement is not restricted to small business concerns, and is open to other than small businesses, provided the lack of adequate competition from small business found in OAM's market research.
Award will be made to the lowest-priced, technically acceptable offeror.  Quotes should be itemized and firm-fixed price.  Vendors should also identify in their quote whether or not Government purchase card is an accepted form of payment.
The point of contact (POC) for this combined synopsis/solicitation is Stefan Martiyan, Contracting Officer at martiyan.stefan@epa.gov.
All quotes shall be submitted to the POC no later than the response date and time.  Quotes submitted after the response date and time will not be accepted.
Below is a list of the items requested in this combined synopsis/solicitation.  One (1) of each item is required.  Manufacturer numbers (Mfr#) have been provided when known.
Item Name/Description: (1) Nikon D800 Digital SLR Camera (Body Only) (Mfr#: 25480); (2) Nikon AF-S Nikkor 24-70mm f/2.8G ED Autofocus Lens (Black); (3) Nikon SB-910 AF Speedlight i-TTL Shoe Mount Flash (Mfr#: 4809); (4) Vello Bounce Dome (Diffuser) for Nikon SB-900 & SB-910 Speedlights (Mfr#: BD-NSB900); (5) Eye-Fi 16GB SDHC Memory Card Pro X2 Wireless Class 10 (Mfr#: EYE-F1-16PC); (6) ScanDisk 32GB Extreme Pro CompactFlash Memory Card (160MB/s) (Mfr#: SDCFXPS-032G-A46); and (7) Nikon EN-EL 15 Lithium-Ion Battery (1900mAh) (Mfr#: 27011)
Brand Name Justification: EPA requires a visual record of its events and happenings.  Up to 1,000 photographic images per week are collected, sorted and posted in multiple places including the National Archive.  EPA maintains a media website with the current image inventory of both events, official and stock images.  Although the website is only 10 years old, the Agency has had an official photographer since it was created, and EPA only hires professional photographers.
Professional photographers use either Nikon or Canon platform.  Once a decision is made to use one brand, no changes are made unless a platform switch is warranted.  EPA's Office of Multimedia (OM) previously chose and currently uses the Nikon platform.  Additionally, OM is not willing to make a switch to a new platform for two (2) non-monetary reasons: (1) Nikon is OM's standard for photography; and (2) Nikon is an industry standard.  Additionally, from a monetary and potential cost savings standpoint, in future procurements, if a new camera, camera lens, camera battery, flash or filter, or any other camera accessory part is needed, then OM would only need to purchase each part versus having to procure a number of new, costly items, or even an entirely new platform.
OM is responsible for all forms of media, including video, web, photo, broadcast, editing, graphics, etc., and each one of these areas has an industry standard for software and equipment.  EPA follows the industry standards for all of its media so that the items remain compatible across each of the fields.  Doing so allows for Agency photographic equipment and the Agency experts who use them to stay state of the art to the maximum extent possible.
Purchase order clauses intended to be included in the award are as follows: + FAR 52.212-4 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (SEP 2013) + FAR 52.212-5 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS - COMMECIAL ITEMS (JAN 2014) + FAR 52.232-39 UNENFORCEABILITY OF UNAUTHORIZED OBLIGATIONS (JUNE 2013) + FAR 52.232-40 PROVIDING ACCELERATED PAYMENTS TO SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTORS (DEC 2013) + FAR 52.252-2 CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998) + EPAAR 1552.211-79 COMPLIANCE WITH EPA POLICIES FOR INFORMATION RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (JAN 2012) + EPA-H-09-107 UNPAID FEDERAL TAX LIABILITY & FELONY CRIMINAL VIOLATION CERTIFICATION (APR 2012)

COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 
The solicitation number is RFQ-DC-14-00045 and the solicitation is issued as request for quotation (RFQ).  Quotes are being solicited in accordance with FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items, FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and solely FAR Subpart 15.101-2 Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source Selection Process under full and open competition.  This acquisition is not being set aside.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 335312.  Vendor should have the same or similar NAICS code. 
Description of Requirement
The US EPA Western Ecology Division (WED) Laboratory main site has a 150 kilowatt (kW) generator which failed during a load test.  Due to the age of the generator a determination has been made to replace the unit.  Along with the removal and proper disposal of the existing generator, the contractor will provide, install, and commission one (1) new efficient 150kW diesel generator with automatic transfer switch (ATS).  The contractor shall install the new generator in the same location as the existing. This project shall be "turnkey" (ready to operate).  The contractor shall provide all work and materials necessary for a fully operational system when complete.  All equipment and materials shall be new except as noted in the statement of work (SOW). WED's main laboratory building is a two story structure constructed in the mid 1960's. The structure is designed with offices and labs.

<DESC>THIS WORK IS SET-ASIDE FOR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS Scope: Demolish from 2 to 8 Army Family Housing buildings, including foundations and all associated site work, at Fort Greely, Alaska. Fort Greely is located along the Richardson Highway, approximately 100 miles south of Fairbanks Alaska. Fort Greely is near Delta Junction, Alaska which as limited housing and support facilities. The eight buildings are all located in the same general area along Third Street in the Cantonment area of Fort Greely. Each building is a townhouse style eight-plex with approximate 15,000 square footage per building. The buildings were constructed in the 1960s and are spread footing, concrete foundations with wood framing. Six of the buildings have attached garage additions that will also be removed. Hazardous surveys have been conducted, and all the buildings have extensive asbestos, which must be removed before final demolition. Various site work around the buildings will be removed including parking lots, Headbolt outlets, stoops, electrical, utilidors, and sidewalks. The utilidors will be demolished back to the mainlines and are assumed to contain asbestos covered piping. The foundation holes will be filled with classified fill and the area will be graded, receive topsoil and seeded. There will be a 58% diversion goal from landfills for all non-hazardous construction debris. The base landfill will be available for disposal of asbestos material and other Construction waste. The area is next to existing occupied housing areas, so noise, safety, dust, etc. are important to manage on this project.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Contractor may authorize Veteran a 72 hour up to 7 day leave of absence; however, the Contractor can only bill for the first 72 hours. The Contractor has the option of discharging the Veteran after the first 72 hours if the bed is not being held for the Veteran.   Even if the provider holds the bed open for the Veteran, the Contractor must discharge the Veteran after the 7th day of absence.  When and if the Veteran returns after the 7th day, it is considered a separate episode of care and the Veteran must reappear on the given months admission list.

The Contractor shall notify the authorizing VA facility immediately when a medical or mental health emergency occurs that requires hospitalization of a referred Veteran.  It is agreed that the Veteran will be admitted to the appropriate VA facility.  When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-federal hospital may be accomplished provided that VA authorization is obtained.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required it is agreed that admission to the appropriate VA facility will be accomplished promptly.  Contractor is required to provide a copy of Standard Operating Procedures for handling patients with psychotic/sucicial patients behavior immediately to the Contract Office Representative (COR) or appropriate designated appointee of VA.


The Contractor shall notify the authorizing VA facility immediately of any incidents involving veterans residing in the residential program.

The Contractor shall comply with the VA Patient's Bill of Rights as set forth in 38 CFR 17.34a (copy available upon request).  

The VA reserves the right to exclude Contractor staff members from providing services to Veterans under this contract based on breaches of conduct, including conduct that jeopardizes patient care or interferes with the regular and ordinary operation of the facility.  Breaches of conduct include intoxication or debilitation resulting from drug use, theft, patient abuse, dereliction or negligence in performing directed tasks, or other conduct resulting in formal complaints by Veterans or other staff members to designated Government representatives.

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Applied Best Practices &amp; Coordination (ABC) team supports OTI's mission by facilitating learning within country programs and across the office, providing leadership on the program strategic planning processes that form OTI's business model, identifying best practices and promoting innovation. The ABC team currently is comprised of two units: The Monitoring, Evaluation, and Training Unit provides guidance and support on monitoring and evaluation and advises on OTI's strategic management processes throughout the life of the program cycle.  It also builds the knowledge, skills, and abilities of OTI staff to continually improve both country program performance as well as their own professional development.  The Information Design Lab promotes innovation, knowledge sharing, and analysis to strengthen country programs through the application of technology and new approaches.  These units coordinate closely with each other as well as with teams and divisions within OTI to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>The Program Performance Management Specialist position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations in the field to provide support and guidance for program implementation, staff training and mentoring, assessments, and the development and application of best practices, including dynamic monitoring, evaluation, and learning in fast-paced, short-term political transition and stabilization programs in complex environments.</p>
<p>In order to help ensure successful political transitions overseas in rapidly changing environments, the Program Performance Management Specialist will ensure that OTI staff, implementing partner staff, and other key players have the information, training, and support they need to start up new programs, seek out and work with appropriate beneficiaries in the field, and manage and close out activities effectively and efficiently.  The vast majority of the workload for this position will be providing expertise and support for action learning, knowledge sharing, monitoring, and evaluation of OTI's field programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). <br />(2) Certification.</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil. Packages sent Federal Express or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<DESC>This notice of a one-on-one industry day was posted the same time as a RFI for this same effort "RFSE." That RFI had instructions that were updated, but the updated instructions for the RFI contained information regarding the industry day (the subject of this notice) that were confusing when read with the instructions of this notice. Those RFI instructions also contained an incorrect e-mail address. This modification is to provide additional time to register for industry day due to the confusion. Please see the updated documents. If you previously registered <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AND</span></strong> you have received an e-mail confirming receipt of your registration from PCO, Peggy Japngie Lizotte, it is not necessary to register again. However, if you have not received an e-mail, please follow the attached instructions to register.

<p>TITLE: Cyber Assurance Technologies</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 11-01-RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800 <br /><br />I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>This BAA is a contracting tool directly responsive to Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) cyber science &amp; technology (S&amp;T) strategic goals. Specifically, this BAA supports the AFRL cyber strategy to: 1) assure and empower the mission; 2) enhance agility and resilience; and 3) invent foundations of trust and assurance.</p>
<p>To support each of these strategic goals, this BAA seeks to procure capabilities that strengthen the foundation of trusted systems, provide resiliency, and integrate the different aspects of cyber operations (attack, defense, and exploitation) as a force multiplier. As such, it supports work in the areas of trusted hardware, trusted software, trusted data, secure systems/architectures, embedded systems, maneuverability, mission awareness, mission assurance, in-situ, run-time survivability and recovery techniques, and effects-based, strategic cyber defense. Supported work should be consistent with the concept of an integrated mission framework for synchronized operations.</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Information Directorate is soliciting white papers in specific focus areas, including cyber agility, incorruptible data, codes, and executables, assured execution, survivability, self-regeneration, immune recovery and mission assurance. NOTE: The POC for each focus area is provided for QUESTIONS ONLY. See Section IV Paragraph 6 for submission details.</p>
<p>The scope of this BAA is not limited to the aforementioned focus areas. Other applicable areas of technology include, but are not limited to, rapid computer/network forensics, attack attribution/geolocation, novel protocols, cloud architectures/security, mobile/embedded device security, secure computer/processor architectures, virtualization security, industrial control system security, cyber technology evaluation techniques, cyber modeling, simulation, metrics, and measurements, cyber data mining/understanding, next generation BIOS Security, and cyber visualization.</p>
<p>SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA: CYBER AGILITY</p>
<p>Background: Currently, adversaries can plan their attacks carefully over time by relying on the static nature of our networks, and launch their attacks at the times and places of their choosing. The DoD needs new tools and technologies to reverse the current asymmetry that favors our cyber adversaries, by forcing them to spend more, cope with greater levels of complexity and uncertainty, and accept greater risks of exposure and detection due to the significantly increased requirements for reconnaissance and intelligence collection of our networks. If we control the dynamics of our systems and networks, any deviation from these known dynamics can also provide an opportunity for increased discrimination of attacker activity and unexpected system states. AFRL will pursue Science &amp; Technology for defensive cyber maneuver and agility to disrupt adversary cyberspace operations, including adversary attack planning and execution.</p>
<p>Agility mechanisms must be incorporated in such a way that they are transparent to authorized users, and must introduce minimal functional and performance impacts. We wish to disrupt our adversaries and not ourselves. The security of such mechanisms is also paramount, so that their power is not co-opted by attackers against us for their own purposes.</p>
<p>Objective: The objective is to avoid attacks by making it harder for a determined adversary to succeed by increasing agility, diversity, and redundancy, to disrupt attack planning and execution.</p>

<p>FOCUS AREA: CYBER MISSION ASSURANCE</p>
<p>Background: This focus is on novel approaches to assure critical Air Force mission essential functions (MEF) in a contested cyber environment. Mission assurance seeks to codify a top-down approach for mapping MEF dependence on cyberspace across the information lifecycle (information generation, processing, storage, transmission, consumption and destruction), identifying cyber vulnerabilities, developing metrics to assess the risk from cyber vulnerabilities on MEF, and developing strategies to mitigate the vulnerabilities. We view mission assurance in the context of preventing and avoiding threats by deterring potential threats through increased costs and reduced benefits.</p>
<p>We seek a scientific basis for mission assurance, including the development of mathematical models to represent MEF dependence on cyber, an exploration of the fractal nature of mission mapping, and the development of metrics for the cost of vulnerability mitigation in proportion to the increased cost to potential threats. These will in turn enable the development of more rigorous approaches to situational understanding as well as command and control.<br /><br />Research into cloud computing technologies could provide potential solutions to the mission assurance research area by increasing the availability and redundancy of continuous or contingency operations. We invite novel techniques for secure data storage, processing and communication practices within a cloud architecture. We seek solutions that utilize the dynamic characteristics of cloud computing technology to prevent and avoid threats. Under the establishment of an internal center of excellence in cloud computing, there is a need for further research within AFRL and the DoD community. The center of excellence should provide opportunities for this research through collaboration and related internships.</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>&bull; Create a scientific basis for mission assurance.<br />&bull; Provide novel techniques for secure data storage, processing and&nbsp;<br />communication practices within a cloud architecture.<br />&bull; Construct appropriate research opportunities within the DoD community.<br />&bull; Support other S&amp;T initiatives in the areas of&nbsp;situational understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; command and control<br /><br />Questions regarding this focus area can be directed to: Dr. Sarah Muccio (315) 330-4016 <a href="mailto:Sarah.Muccio@us.af.mil">Sarah.Muccio@us.af.mil</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>FOCUS AREA: FIGHT THROUGH &amp; SURVIVE WITH MISSION ASSURANCE</p>
<p>Background: The DoD has a critical need for information systems that adapt and/or gracefully degrade when unexpected events occur. These systems are subjected to constant change such as overload, component failure, cyber attacks, evolving operational requirements, and/or a dynamic operational environment. A system should adapt to these changes by reconfiguring its resources to provide a different, though acceptable, level of service and security to assure mission essential functions. Without adaptation many important activities receive fewer resources than needed while less important activities waste resources by receiving more resources than necessary. Most existing systems either do not adapt or have ad hoc hardwired mechanisms to accommodate only a small, predefined, set of changes. There are no standard methodologies or common tools to assist application developers in managing this sort of dynamic adaptation.</p>
<p>Objective: The vision for this focus area is "survive with mission assurance". This focus area is concerned with runtime assessment and management of resources/assets to ensure mission essential functions and conveying trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Fight Through &amp; Survive with Mission Assurance" focus area explores the research challenges below, but other approaches that achieve the stated objectives will be considered:</p>
<p>(1) Cyber Defense Metrics - Identify low-level observable properties and measurable quantities that contribute to the mission based assessment.</p>
<p>(2) Mission Aware Adaptive Tradeoffs - Integration of QoS (Functionality) and QoIA (Security) management. There is a need to understand tradeoff policy and de-confliction of QoS and QoIA based on the mission. There is a need to develop fine-grained tunable IA mechanisms and controls.</p>
<p>(3) Survivability Architecture- Compose a survivability architecture that supports and enforces service delivery and information assurance requirements based on mission priorities.<br />Questions regarding this focus area can be directed to: Anthony Macera (315) 330-4480, <a href="mailto:anthony.macera.1@us.af.mil">anthony.macera.1@us.af.mil</a></p>
<p><br />FOCUS AREA: SELF-REGENERATIVE INCORRUPTIBLE ENTERPRISE THAT DYNAMICALLY RECOVERS WITH IMMUNITY</p>
<p>Background: Existing approaches to information system security and survivability consist of preventing, detecting and containing unintentional errors and/or cyber attacks. The problem with this approach is that regardless of how well systems are protected or how well they tolerate errors and/or attacks; they will eventually fail over time unless they have the ability to self-regenerate. Once a successful cyber attack is discovered the adversary can quickly use the same attack over and over again to cause the same negative effect on our mission. Existing systems are currently taken offline and out of the fight for hours to days to be repaired and there is no guarantee that the repair is immune to the attack or variants of the attack. What are needed are information systems that are able to dynamically recover with immunity in mission time without human intervention in response to unforeseen errors and/or previously unknown cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Objective: The vision for this focus area is "recover with immunity". This focus area is concerned with recovering with immunity from errors and/or cyber attacks to ensure mission critical systems stay in the fight.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Self Regenerative, Incorruptible Enterprise" focus area explores the research challenges below, but other approaches that achieve the stated objectives will be considered:</p>
<p><br />(1) Persistent applications (data &amp; state) - The goal of this technology area is to make applications hard to corrupt, disable or remove (like malware). When an attack is successful these applications find a way to keep performing the mission.</p>
<p>(2) Machine Generated Reconstitution - The goal of this technology area is to automatically machine-generate repairs to recover with immunity from errors/cyber attacks.</p>
<p>(3) Reconstitution of Data and State - The goal of this technology area is mission continuation by automatically repairing corrupted data &amp; state to remove residue from errors/cyber attacks.</p>
<p>(4) Understanding Synthetic Diversity or other technology used to recover with immunity - There is a need to better understand the use of synthetic diversity or other technology used to ensure complete attack space coverage and/or understand the effectiveness against various classes of cyber attack.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this focus area can be directed to: Anthony Macera (315) 330-4480, <a href="mailto:anthony.macera.1@us.af.mil">anthony.macera.1@us.af.mil</a></p>

<p><br />V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>(1) Overall scientific and/or technical merit including technical feasibility, degree of innovation, and understanding of the technical and operational approach for employment of the technology;</p>
<p>(2) The effort's potential contribution and relevance to the U. S. Air Force's mission assurance objectives;</p>
<p>(3) The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, which may include testing of prototype capabilities and assessment against Information Assurance requirements; and</p>
<p>(4) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs, and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA from multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p><br />VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS: AFRL/RIGA will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a> and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp</a> or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-3572. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your Proposal.</p>
<p>3. DATA RIGHTS: The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports.<br /><br />VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID. NO PROJECT PLANS OR SPECIFICATIONS ARE AVAILABLE. THIS PROJECT IS TENTATIVELY SET TO BE ADVERTISED ON NOVEMBER 12, 2013 WITH A TENTATIVE BID OPENING DATE OF&nbsp;DECEMBER 11, 2013.</strong><br /><br />The Mooney Road project is located in Plumas County and in Lassen County on California Forest Highway (FH) 117 near Westwood, California. The project will provide resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation to 7.1 miles of roadway from approximate 1500 feet south of Swain Mountain Road to the intersection with California SR-44. Work will be suspended for approximately 3100 feet within the project limits from Station 723+43 to Station 754+10 for a realignment project to be designed and constructed under the authority of Lassen County.<br /><br />The major work elements include cold in-place recycle of the existing pavement to a depth of 3 &frac12; inches, subexcavation, asphalt surfacing of 3 inches, guardrail removal and installation, and selective tree thinning. Due to the elevation of the project, snow melt typically occurs in late Spring, and snow falls in late Fall, thus controlling commencement and termination of construction operations. All work is expected to take place between April, 2014 and early November, 2014. Temperature dependent work items such as cold in-place recycle, asphalt paving, and pavement marking must be completed in dry conditions, for which seasonal conditions are limited.<br /><br />The estimated cost of the proposed project is between $5 Million and $8 Million. <br /><br />Significant quantities include:<br /><br />Line Item Unit Estimated Quantity<br />Subexcavation CY 280<br />Selective Clearing SY 7,500<br />Roadway Aggregate TON 6,600<br />Hot Asphalt Conc. Pavem't TON 22,000<br />Cold Recycled Asphalt Base SY 129,000<br />Guardrail LF 1,375

<DESC>This amendment is issued to identify additional specifications omitted from the previous submission.
The United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 5, Contracting and General Services, intends to award a sole-source purchase order to Telonics, Inc., 932 E. Impala Avenue, Messa AZ 85204, for the purchase of:  1) Platform Terminal Transmitter Satellite Tracking Tags (PTTs), implantable and external, for Diving Bird Study.  2) Refurbished Platform Terminal Transmitter Satellite Tracking Tags (PTTs), implantable and external, for Diving Bird Study  3)  Shipping: Item is the costs to ship items to Hadley Massachusetts 01035.  The proposed contract action is for a product for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.305.  The approval of a sole source justification has resulted from technically sophisticated requirements and tested reliability.  PTTs are efficient, lightweight, and transmit data for long periods (up to or exceeding 1,400 hours).  PTTs contain software to support multiple duty cycles in a calendar year format.  This programming tells the tags when to switch transmission cycles according to a date within a calendar year.  Under this unique capability, any firms believing that they can provide the products listed may submit a written response to be received at the Contracting Office no later than 14 days after the date of publication of this notice, clearly showing its ability to provide the items described with equal accuracy and reliability.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  Responses are to be submitted to Christine Beauregard by email to christine_beauregard@fws.gov

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2) 	 (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to: (A) Change the name in the SAM database; (B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (End of Clause) Alternate I (Aug 2012) When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause. (a) Inspection/Acceptance. (1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. (2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. (3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier. <BR> <BR>(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5) (i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may? (A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or (B) Terminate this contract for cause. (ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to-- (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor?s managerial personnel; or (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor?s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor?s managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. <BR> <BR>(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract. (9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor?s obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property. (e) Definitions. (1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. As used in this clause? (i) Direct materials means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection with the furnishing of the end product or service. (ii) Hourly rate means the rate(s) prescribed in the contract for payment for labor that meets the labor category qualifications of a labor category specified in the contract that are? (A) Performed by the contractor; (B) Performed by the subcontractors; or (C) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control. (iii) Materials means? (A) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control; (B) Subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract; (C) Other direct costs (e.g., incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract, travel, computer usage charges, etc.); (D) The following subcontracts for services which are specifically excluded from the hourly rate: [Insert any subcontracts for services to be excluded from the hourly rates prescribed in the schedule.]; and (E) Indirect costs specifically provided for in this clause. (iv) Subcontract means any contract, as defined in FAR Subpart 2.1, entered into with a subcontractor to furnish supplies or services for performance of the prime contract or a subcontract including transfers between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of a contractor or subcontractor. It includes, but is not limited to, purchase orders, and changes and modifications to purchase orders. <BR> <BR>(i) Payments. (1) Work performed. The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices approved by the Contracting Officer: (i) Hourly rate. (A) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number of direct labor hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. (B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer. (C) Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative. (D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the contract. (E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis. (1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated. (2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract. (3) If the Schedule provided rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>(ii) Materials. (A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall not exceed the Contractor?s established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the-- (1) Quantities being acquired; and (2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements. (B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor? (1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or (2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor?s payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice. (C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall? (1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and (2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable to the contract. (D) Other Costs. Unless listed below, other direct and indirect costs will not be reimbursed. (1) Other direct Costs. The Government will reimburse the Contractor on the basis of actual cost for the following, provided such costs comply with the requirements in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(B) of this clause: [Insert each element of other direct costs (e.g., travel, computer usage charges, etc. Insert ?None? if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided. If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert ?Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert ?None?.?] (2) Indirect Costs (Material handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert ?$0? if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert ?Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert ?None?.?] <BR> <BR>(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. (3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. (4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer): <BR> <BR>(i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice met the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract. (ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment? (A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic); (B) The Contractor?s timekeeping procedures; (C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and (D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices. (iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost? (A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and (B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices. (5) Overpayments/Underpayments. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor?s payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall? (i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the? (A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment); (B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable; (C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and (D) Contractor point of contact. (ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>(6) (i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in section 611 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid. (ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract. (iii) Final Decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if? (A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner; (B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or (C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.60702). (iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment. (v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates: (A) The date fixed under this contract. (B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination. (vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on? (A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor; (B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or (C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor. <BR> <BR>(vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract. (viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the ?completion invoice? and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion. (7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions. (i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor. (ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier. (iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents. (8) Prompt payment. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315. <BR> <BR>(9) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause. (10) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made. (l) Termination for the Government?s convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor?s records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided. (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon written request, with adequate assurances of future performance. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount computed under paragraph (i) Payments of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours expended in furnishing work not delivered to or accepted by the Government shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this clause, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. In the event of termination for cause, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>**UPDATE-The purpose of this amendment is to notify contractors of Amendment W900KK14R0074-0001 dated Jan 24 2014. The amendment reflects corrections to the RFP Question and Answer deadline dates.  Attachment 'RFPAmendment01' provides the modification to the solicitation document. The proposal submission due date remains unchanged at this time.**   <br>  <br> The current posting serves as the Pre-Solicitation Notice ('notice of proposed contract action quote mark  in accordance with FAR 5.203(a)) for the Threat Systems Operations Maintenance and Integrated Support (TSOMIS) effort.  The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) has a requirement to provide the acquisition, development, fielding, operations, maintenance, and sustainment of Threat systems for Army testing and training.     <br>    <br>  REQUIREMENT:  <br>    <br>  PEO STRI anticipates a requirement for Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Integrated Support.  TSOMIS will encompass providing the test and evaluation and training community with services that are capable of operating, maintaining and sustaining ground and airborne Threat Systems.  The Threat Systems must be maintained, operated and sustained to provide realistic Threat capabilities for Operational and Developmental testing and training with the U.S. Army.  This support will include engineering, configuration management, technical inspections, testing, evaluations, validation and accreditation, transportation, site surveys, transportation upload and download support, logistics, developmental support, integration, storage, maintenance, operations, and training including items of support equipment such as system spare parts, special tools, test equipment and depot level documentation.  There are two locations anticipated as the place of performance for these services and support.  They are Government facilities at Redstone Arsenal (RSA), Alabama, 35898 and Government facilities at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico, 88002.  <br>    <br>    <br>  ACQUISITION APPROACH:  <br>    <br>  The Government anticipates a Single Award Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) contract vehicle to be awarded.  The Contract Line Item Number structure for the task orders will be structured appropriately to the level of effort to be performed.  The predominance of the work will be CPFF and Time and Materials.  The period of performance is anticipated to be one base year and four one-year options for a potential period of performance of five-years.  The estimated dollar value is approximately $45M.      <br>    <br>  The anticipated Procurement Acquisition Lead Time (PALT) milestones are as follows:  <br>    <br>  Anticipated Event Approximate Dates:  <br>    <br>  Release of TSOMIS Draft Solicitation: 06 December 2013  <br>  Deadline for submission of Questions to Draft Solicitation: 17 December 2013  <br>  Release of TSOMIS Final Solicitation: 22 January 2014  <br>  Proposal Submission: 24 February 2014  <br>  Target Award Date: December 2014  <br>    <br>  Disclaimer: This notice is not a Solicitation/Request for Proposal, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for costs associated with providing comments, questions, concerns, or suggestions.  This action is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure the subject products, services or information.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this notice.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.    <br>    <br>  Primary Point of Contact: Terri Harvey, terri.l.harvey10.civ@mail.mil, 407-208-3338  <br>  Additional Point of Contact: Jean M.

<p>The is a notification that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has awarded on a sole source basis a contract for brand name Q-Matics commercial product and services to Q-Matic Corporation, 2400 Commerce Ave STE 100, Duluth, GA 30096-8905. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements</p>
<p>The IRS requires renewal of Q-matic hardware and software maintenance and repair and replacement services for the Q-Matic Queuing Management System. These existing systems within IRS use Qmatic proprietary hardware and software that cannot be duplicated, substituted, or serviced, by any other vendor. The systems must integrate with the existing IRS queuing management systems, Tier B programs, and IRS network infrastructure. The system is networked to provide on-line access to Customer Service statistics. Qmatic provides a proprietary commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) networking solution for these systems that is uniquely capable of providing the queuing and management information that will address IRS' strategic plans for improved customer service, employee satisfaction and business results.</p>
<p>The IRS plans to continue its investment within its existing infrastructure utilizing the Q-matic hardware, software and repair/replacement services. Thus, this acquisition is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of product and services manufactured by another company. As such, this requirement must be purchased in order to ensure continued maintenance of the existing Q-matic hardware and software.</p>
<p>Based on the above, the justification is certified as complete and accurate by the technical requirements personnel to the best of the technical personnel and the Contracting Officer's knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>The period of performance is for a base year and one option year.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for proposals or an invitation for bids. The Government does not anticipate receiving responses to this notice of a non-competitive action. <br /><br />Geri Arillo<br />e-Mail: Geri.A.Arillo@irs.gov.</p>
