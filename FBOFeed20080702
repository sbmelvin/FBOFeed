Located in the heart of the city near LAX, LA AFB is home to military and their families, as well as an employer to over 6,000 civilian employees.</p>
<p>Sponsorship is fundamental to the success of this event. Los Angeles AFB invites you to join in supporting the morale, welfare and recreation of our military and their family members by becoming a commercial sponsor for our Community Center, The Club, Youth Activities, Fitness Center or&nbsp;Outdoor Recreation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sponsorship may take the form of monetary or in-kind contributions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In appreciation for your sponsorship, your company will receive public recognition and exposure.

Sponsor exposure may include name and logo recognition on all event print media, including posters, signage, and banners, brochures, pictures and media coverage. More than one sponsor may be accepted and additives will be considered.</p>
<p>Under paragraph 4.1 of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 34-407, we are unable to solicit sponsorship from alcohol or tobacco companies, or from defense contractors, including their affiliates, subcontractors, teaming partners, or joint venture partners. Depending on the circumstances, unsolicited sponsorship offers may be accepted if those offers are not in conflict with existing contracts, memorandums of agreement or understanding, or detrimental to business relationships between military and existing civilian contractors. Unsolicited offers are not accepted from barred contractors. If your company is disqualified due to the above criteria, we ask that you do not respond to this sponsorship solicitation.</p>
<p>This is a solicitation for commercial sponsorship by a non appropriated funds instrumentality of the United States Government and does not obligate appropriated funds of the Government.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Columbia Area Office intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the The Yakima River Basin Coalition. The purpose of this contract is to obtain assistance from the Yakima Coalition in the development of a steehead life cycle model for use in the Endangered Species Act consultation on the future operation and maintenance of the Yakima Project.The authority for use of other than full and open competition for this transaction is implemented by FAR 6.302-   Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The cited authority must be used because it is the only practicable method of acquisition due to the nature of the supplies or services to be acquired as follows:
The model being acquired will allow Reclamation to estimate the risk of extinction for steelhead associated with the proposed future operations of the Yakima Project.  Steelhead in parts of the Yakima basin form sub-populations that are part of larger populations that include rainbow trout. 
The Yakima Coalition has been heavily involved in fishery issues in the basin for several decades and have provided two previous reports that examine the viability of steelhead in the Mid-Columbia, including the Yakima basin.  In assembling those two reports they gathered the available data sets on steelhead production and survival in the Yakima basin from a variety of sources, evaluated the data quality and applicability and made estimates of viability of Yakima steelhead populations and other steelhead populations in the Mid-Columbia ESU.  Given their understanding of Yakima Project operations, the existing steelhead production and survival data, and steelhead viability issues in the basin, they are uniquely qualified to develop this model.  
A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action  is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Inquiries received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future, if the need arises.
Inquiries will be accepted by Fax at (509) 454-5615, Attention: Connie Morgan

<DESC>PURPOSE:  The purpose of this market survey is to give industry an opportunity to respond and describe their capabilities to perform the requirement described herein.  The purpose of the implementing this GRC environment is to enable the FAA to adhere to the letter and spirit of OMB A-123 and achieve better internal financial controls.  This market survey is to notify the supplier community that the FAA intends to acquire this solution from Oracle.
REQUIREMENT:  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of a governance, risk and control COTS software solution consisting of software, licensing, and maintenance for development and production a Financial Internal Controls environment.  This environment will allow internals controls staff to manage, monitor and test internal controls to better manage FAA's financial controls. The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate for the Oracle GRC product through an authorized reseller.  This is done in accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4.  A firm-fixed-price purchase order will be awarded to fulfill this requirement.  
BACKGROUND:  The FAA is required to adhere to OMB Circular A-123 as part of the Department of Transportation's (DOT) department wide compliance initiative. As with many federal agencies addressing OMB A-123, the FAA primarily uses spreadsheet and database tools to monitor, test, remediate, and report its progress with internal controls compliance, which is a manual and thus labor intensive effort.
Due to the complexity and reporting requirements of OMB A-123 across the FAA, an alternative approach to the governance, risk, and compliance of annual assessment requirements is needed. This new approach should streamline the review and approval of agency documentation, enhance management oversight, improve the reporting and monitoring functionalities throughout the annual assessment, and create a central repository for documentation.
MANDATORY QULAFICATION REQUIREMENTS:  In order to be considered responsive, organizations expressing interest in this matter must provide clear evidence showing:.  Leverages the existing FAA investment in Logical Apps .  Prevents the additional expense of integrating other solutions with Logical Apps.  Prevents the additional; expense of acquiring and integrating multiple stove pipe solutions for different aspects of Governance, Risk and Control.  Prevent the additional expense of maintaining the code, APIs and scripts to glue the stove piped solution together initially and during each upgrade release.    .  Enable simple and less expensive integration with Oracle financials. 
FUNCTIONALITY:  Acquire a solution that shall enable Internal Controls Division, AFM-600, to effectively plan, model, report and analyze GRC activities so that potential issues are identified earlier and corrective actions are more timely and informed.  This can be accomplished by the following:	Leverage a single, integrated source of compliance information across headquarters, lines of business, and regions.	Get a consistent view and measure of risk across the agency.	Reduce control deficiencies while increasing information reliability.	Leverage out-of-the-box reports with hundreds of pre-delivered metrics and guided analysis.	Target delivery of intelligence through role-based dashboards with drill down to detailed evidence.	Review control information via multiple dimensions.	Route alerts and notifications for appropriate action.	Quickly identify the root causes of issues for rapid remediation.

<DESC>SPLASH-SPRAY ASSESSMENT TOOL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has a requirement for innovative approaches to the development of predictive models that will help determine the potential for splash and spray occurrence on highway pavements. The results from this activity will directly support ongoing efforts to improve user satisfaction with the nation’s highways.

This effort has its foundation in the Pavement Surface Characteristics focus area of the FHWA Pavements and Materials Strategic Plan.  

Specific objectives of the forthcoming solicitation will likely include:

1.Evaluate prior work in the area of splash and spray mechanisms, effects, factors affecting, and measurement on in-service highways.  
2. Develop a model to predict the water film thickness and propensity for splash and spray occurrence on pavement surfaces considering the range of conditions encountered on in-service highway pavements and under meteorological conditions anticipated.
3. Validate/refine the model developed under semi-controlled conditions.
4. Develop candidate threshold criteria based upon the model developed and the impact of splash and spray on highway users.
5. Document all development efforts and prepare technology transfer materials.

This is a Pre-Solicitation notice (synopsis) for an acquisition which will be conducted under full and open competitive procedures.  All potential sources are encouraged to submit proposals, either individually or in teams.

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard in $11M.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106.

The purpose of this procurement is the delivery of enumeration information on women from Guanacaste and regions of Puntarenas that are within the ages of 22 and 30.. This information will be used to evaluate the initial feasibility of ascertaining this new control group for future efforts.  Fundacion Inciensa (FUNIN) will provide important information that will help define the possibility of ascertaining and inviting for participation a new group of controls for the extended follow-up phase of the Human Papillomavirus  (HPV) Vaccine Trial in Costa Rica. The control group will consist of women living in the same study areas included in the original trial and from the same birth cohorts.  

Specifically, the contractor, Fundación Inciensa, shall deliver enumeration information to the NCI by the Fall of 2008.  This acquisition will provide unique information to evaluate the feasibility of recruiting a new control group of young women from Guanacaste and Puntarenas, Costa Rica for the extended follow-up phase of an ongoing HPV Vaccine Trial in Costa Rica that was initiated in 2004.

Period of Performance shall be 5 months from date of award.

FUNIN is the only source known to the NCI that has recent, up-to-date, and complete enumeration of women in the same age range as women currently enrolled in our vaccine trial and from the same catchment area within Costa Rica.  Assessment of the feasibility of ascertaining women for the new control group planned during the extended phase of the HPV Vaccine trial in Costa Rica requires enumeration data from the specific target population in the Guanacaste and Puntarenas regions.

<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) intends to procure on a sole-source basis for services regarding the project, "The Impact of Smoking and Helical Computed Tomography (CT) Screening on Lung Cancer Mortality" with Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Institute for Technology Assessment (ITA), 101 Merrimac Street, Boston MA 02114.<br /> <br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541690 and the business size standard is $6.5M</p>
<p>Period of performance:  Performance shall be for one year from date of award.</p>
<p>The Institute for Technology Assessment (ITA) at the Massachusetts General Hospital has developed a lung cancer screening simulation model.  The purpose of the model is to evaluate the cost effectiveness and costs of helical computed tomography (CT).  The basis of any model of lung cancer is the impact of smoking history on the incidence and mortality from lung cancer.  This is important as researchers consider who should be screened for lung cancer.</p>
<p>The Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) is a consortium of NCI-sponsored investigators whose focus is to use modeling to improve our understanding of the impact of cancer control interventions (e.g., prevention, screening treatment) on population trends in incidence and mortality. These models are also used to project future trends, and to help determine optimal cancer control strategies.  The work scope of this contract will involve participation in the ongoing lung base cases (simulation of smoking patterns and CT screening studies), attendance at bi-annual CISNET meetings, participation in regular conference calls, maintenance of the ITA Model Profiler, and joint manuscript preparation.</p>
<p>The contractor shall:</p>
<p>Participate in Base Case Projects - The purpose of the lung cancer screening base case is to further validate and extend the ITA results that have been published in Radiology against other models.  Base case projects involve use of common inputs, simulation of a specified scenario, and completion of standardized templates or spreadsheets.  The contractor shall make necessary coding changes to the model, perform simulations to generate outputs, and complete population of standardized templates.</p>
<p>Maintain Model Profiler - The MGH has completed the first public release of its Model Profiler (available at www.cisnet.cancer.gov/profiles). The contractor shall update documentation of assumptions, inputs, and results.</p>
<p>The MGH ITA lab under the direction of Dr.  G.  Scott Gazelle focuses on evaluating the benefits, costs and appropriate use of new medical technologies.    Dr.  Pamela McMahon also with MGH ITA has worked extensively with the ITA Lung Cancer Policy Model since development of the model and completed the current Model Profiler.  The MGH ITA Model is the only published result on this topic.  The contractor will contribute results toward the completion of a publication.</p>
<p>For the above reasons, the MGH ITA is uniquely qualified to carry out this contract.  Any efforts to identify the required skills and expertise through outside sources would pose additional undo costs to the government.  Therefore, in the best interest of the government this contract should be awarded to the MGH ITA.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT on July 17, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with the University of Wisconsin, 1525 Linden Drive, Madison, WI 53706 for services regarding the evaluation of gene expression in the Study to Understand Cervical Cancer Early Endpoints and Determinants (SUCCEED).<br /> <br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541690 and the business size standard is $6.5M</p>
<p>Period of performance:  Performance shall be for one year from date of award.</p>
<p>The main objective of SUCCEED is to identify host and viral biomarkers that will distinguish those women with HPV infections that are likely to clear infection from those that are likely to have persistent infection and progress to cervical cancer.  As part of the SUCCEED study, frozen specimens from cervix lesions representative of the disease continuum (normal, CIN1, CIN2, CIN3, cancer) have been embedded in cryomolds and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.  This protocol for frozen cervix tissue procurement was implemented for preservation of RNA which is intended to be extracted from pure cell populations and processed to define host gene expression profiles.</p>
<p>The contractor shall evaluate cervix tissue quality, conduct laser capture microdissection, RNA extraction, and host and viral expression arrays on frozen cervix tissues provided by the NCI.</p>
<p>As the HPV chip and the microRNA chip are produced solely by the University of Wisconsin at Madison and the utilization of this assay is critical to the proposed analysis of SUCCEED specimens for host and viral expression, it is further suggested that the processing of SUCCEED specimens be done at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Dawn Provenzale, 508 Fulton Street, Durham, North Carolina 27705 for services regarding the Patient-Reported Outcomes Quality Improvement Survey for the Cancer Care Quality Monitoring System (CCQMS).<br /> <br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541690 and the business size standard is $6.5M</p>
<p>Period of performance:  Performance shall be for one year from date of award.</p>
<p>The project's specific objectives are to augment the Veterans Health Administration's existing colorectal cancer care electronic quality measurement system tool to develop, with co-investigators at the University of Minnesota and the Minneapolis VAMC.  The tool has been created by Dr. Provenzale for use in the VHA population.  This is a patient and caregiver specific component of the tool in the form of a mailed survey that will complement the data collected from the medical record abstraction portion of the Cancer Care Quality Monitoring System. Once the survey has been developed, it will be linked with the CCQMS medical record abstraction tool and will be shared with colleagues in the Department of Defense for use in their health care system.</p>
<p>The deliverables include:</p>
<p>a.	A well developed medical record abstraction tool (based on NCCN Guidelines) <br />b.	A well defined network of DOD investigators and sites to test the linked abstraction/survey tool.<br />c.	A well defined set of procedures for measuring quality of care through medical record abstraction and concomitant patient and caregiver survey.<br />d.	A manual that contains templates for the data abstraction and the survey tools, a data dictionary, codebook and source code, a quality indicator mapping document, a variable list and administrative tool, and other critical components determined to be necessary for use in DOD facilities.  <br />e.	A draft manuscript that describes the development of the CCQMS medical record linked survey tool.</p>
<p>Dr. Provenzale is uniquely suited to further extend her work in patient assessment and quality measurement to both the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense through her current work as the principal investigator of the Colorectal Cancer Care Quality Measurement System (CCQMS) Development project in the VHA.  In addition to her work on the CCQMS, Dr. Provenzale has had extensive experience in initiating and conducting multi-center studies of patient surveys and quality measurement and their use in electronic medical records systems for research.  She is the only VA investigator that has VHA IRB approval to access electronic medical records for the purpose of developing and testing the Colorectal Cancer Care Quality Measurement System. This approval is essential to link the survey data to the medical records data. She also is the VHA Principal Investigator for the National Cancer Institute (NCI)/VHA collaborative Cancer Care Outcome Research and Surveillance (CanCORS), in which she is collecting data from 14 VHA sites to measure longitudinal outcomes and quality of colorectal cancer care via both medical record and patient survey and caregiver data.  Dr.Provenzale is the only VHA member of the CanCORS Steering Committee.  Given this background and expertise, Dr. Provenzale is uniquely qualified to undertake this work.</p>

<DESC>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), for the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) intends to negotiate and award a contract on a sole source noncompetitive basis to Dr. Zhennan Lai, 2 Boat House Court, N. Potomac, MD 20878 to prepare and analyze samples from Sjogren’s patients using micro array technologies.

General Description
 The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), The Molecular Physiology and Therapeutics Branch (MPTB), Division of Intramural Research (DIR) has a need for the services of an expert who can perform microarray technology as well as novel technology to follow changes in gene expression.  This expertise is necessary in order to expand upon NIDCR’s current studies in patients suffering from Sjögren’s Syndrome.  

Primary Sjögren’s Syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by exocrine gland dysfunction primarily involving the salivary and lacrimal gland. The histological hallmark of Sjögren’s Syndrome is a periductal inflammatory infiltrate. The conventional explanation of salivary gland dysfunction assumes a causal relationship between this chronic inflammatory process and decreased saliva production. However, most patients have preserved salivary gland tissue and in overall the correlation between the focus score on SG biopsy (a measure of inflammation) and saliva production is limited.  

Statement of Work
In this study, NIDCR plans to identify salivary gland abnormalities that may predispose to Salivary Gland dysfunction in Sjögren’s Syndrome patients.  To explore if the striking female predominance of SS can be explained by intrinsic differences in salivary glands, the gene expression profiles of healthy men and women will be compared as well as mouse models of the disease. This approach may identify abnormalities that are either intrinsic to the salivary gland (male to female and normal to SS comparison) or are important in the chronic inflammatory process (normal looking cells vs. cells from infiltrate). These studies are covered under protocols 84-D-0056, 94-D-0018 and 99-D-0070.

Requirements
The specific tasks to be performed are to prepare and analyze samples from Sjogren’s patients using micro array technology by a scientist who has in-depth knowledge and understanding of genetic biomarkers.  This work will be performed in Molecular Physiology and Therapeutics Branch lab space on the NIH Campus in Building 10.  

The period of performance is July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009.

The reference number for this notice is NHLBI-PB-(DE)-2008-173-TMB.

The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures and the resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-26.

The total estimated amount of this contract is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $100,000.00. 

Market research conducted by the Government in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations, Part 10 – Market Research, has determined that there are no reasonable expectations of obtaining competitive quotes for this requirement.  Therefore, the acquisition is being conducted on a noncompetitive, sole source basis.  

The intended procurement will be classified under North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 541990 and the associated small business size standard is $ 6.5 Million. 
 
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The resulting acquisition will be entered into pursuant to the acquisition authority set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) and HHSAR 306-302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.  The determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement. Responses to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB-(DE)-2008-173-TMB may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention: Tracy Brooks.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 5416   Scope of Work
The Office of Wetlands, Oceans, and Watersheds (OWOW), Assessment and Watershed Protection Division, Non-Point Source Branch is tasked with evaluating the performance and costs of Low-Impact Development (LID) Best Management Practices (BMP) as part of encouraging communities to incorporate LID.  An important component of the evaluation is the development and promotion of a stormwater management tool that will serve multiple uses:  1) Provide a framework to easily demonstrate to non-technical users the type performance results (reduction in surface water runoff) that can be achieved by LID practices  - the user will be able to conceptually design facilities to meet their specified runoff reduction goals; 2) Serve as an outreach tool to encourage users to experiment with different potential stormwater management scenarios; 3) Provide users with planning-level capital cost estimates.
The use of this cost tool will enable non-technical users to estimate the amount of stormwater that could be retained on-site by comparing their "Conventional" site design to a "Green Scenario" with LID BMPs, in an easy-to-follow, on-line worksheet.  The user will have the ability to easily modify the scenarios, creating an understanding of the surface runoff benefits of LID.  The intent is that the tool will promote more use of LID and green infrastructure in development and redevelopment. 
OWOW plans to enhance an on-line Stormwater Management Calculator that the Center for Neighborhood Technology (CNT) has prepared in a beta version for Chicago.  The CNT's Calculator has already been developed in a preliminary form and is copyrighted. The Calculator incorporates many of the desired features for LID BMPs, with rainfall retention amount compared to those required in the Chicago Stormwater Ordinance.  The spreadsheet tool was developed by CNT as part of the Chicago effort to expand the use of LID techniques and promote a better understanding of the resulting reductions in surface runoff.  Use of this copyrighted CNT calculator as basis for an enhanced nationally-applicable LID BMP calculator will serve several objectives:  1) Minimize the cost of developing a new tool by building on one that already incorporates many of the desired features; 2) Improve the outreach and use of the tool via the existing network of CNT users; and 3) Engage the existing CNT project team that has experience in developing and launching this type of user-friendly on-line tool. 
CNT has agreed that if they are selected for this project they will make the resulting enhanced tool, with the previously developed components, freely available to EPA and to the public.  
Procurement is requested for the following items:
1.  Modify the copyrighted Stormwater Management Calculator to make it more nationally-applicable, with consideration of the following features:
I.	Addition of a scenario for "predevelopment", so that users can compare "conventional" and "green" to user-entered "predevelopment" conditions.II.	Modification of the runoff volume control goal of 0.5 inches for Chicago to a user-specified goal of depth or of "predevelopment" conditions.III.	Addition of a pick-list of runoff control goals (for example: Chicago's 0.5 inches; the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007's goal of "predevelopment"; draft LEED-ND credits), to assist the user in selecting an appropriate goal while educating the user about existing runoff control goals throughout the US.IV.	Addition of more LID BMPs, such as disconnected downspouts, amended soils, cisterns/rain barrels, reduced street widths, and elimination of curb and gutter. V.	Recommend  a way to report the quantity of annual rainfall and the estimate of the amount of runoff that each scenario reduces annually.VI.	Addition of a printer-ready format for generation of results.VII.	Enhancement of visual graphics.VIII.	Addition of a link to a description of the methods and assumptions used in estimating surface runoff reductions and cost estimates, with limitations noted. 
Period of Performance: August 1 - February 20, 2009
Deliverable Schedule:  	Prefinal Draft: September 30, two week comment period	Final Draft: December 15, four week comment period	Final Deliverable: February 20, 2009

<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with the University of California, Riverside (UCR) for Analysis of the Simplified Measurement Method  (SMM) vs. Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) for Marine Engine Exhaust.  UCR will be tasked with running a marine in-use emission measurement test incorporating the measurement of NOx, THC, CO, and CO2 from the marine engine exhaust.  The emission measurements will occur simultaneously using an SMM system that is compliant with IMO NOx Technical Code and a PEMS system that is compliant with 40 CFR Part 1065.  There will be two optional tests for (1) Testing of Main Propulsion Engine on Low Sulfur MDO (LSMDO) within 24 nm of Port and (2) Testing of Additional Marine Vessels.	UCR researchers are uniquely qualified for this effort due to their extensive expertise in being able to measure the required regulated gaseous emission pollutants from ocean going vessel main propulsion engines using specialized laboratory based equipment as described in the International Maritime Organization (IMO) NOx Technical Code (Simplified Measurement Method).  Market research revealed that the University of California, Riverside has the specialized SMS laboratory equipment required to conduct the measurement of on-board emissions from ocean going vessels and expertise in providing similar analyses. 
THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing the required analysis of the Simplified Measurement Method  (SMM) vs. Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) for Marine Engine Exhaust may submit appropriate documentation within 15 calendar days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Documentation should be submitted in writing to Scott Tharp via Fax (513) 487-2107 or email Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be honored.

The Instrument shall interface to a PC running Windows 2000 or XP for data transfer to an Access database,  run on one of the types of power:  either 110/120 Volts AC @ 60 Hz., with 20 amps max. current draw, or 240 Volts AC @ 60 Hz., with 20 amps max. current draw.  In addition, The Instrument shall have on-site upgrades, calibrations, and repairs, to the maximum extent possible, have meniscus sensing of the receiver level, and be designed in such a way that easy access to maintenance items, such as the heater plates, condenser, etc., is provided.  For the equipment specified, the contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include all phases of the project, design/configuration, assembly, integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation and training of EPA staff.  The contractor shall be responsible for documenting measurement traceability and system acceptance in a manner suitable for audit to ISO standards.  
The contractor shall be responsible for the necessary hardware and software to operate the system according to specifications.  Shipping, delivery, and installation in the NVFEL lab shall be included.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>PRESOLICTION NOTICE PURSUANT TO FAR PART 5.204:

The Transportation Security Administration faces an adaptive and motivated enemy whose choice of targets depends significantly on the perceived and actual vulnerability of the security system.  As such, the ability to randomize the placement, scheduling, and sequence of security measures (people, process, and technology) can frustrate terrorist plans and even deter attacks because of unpredictability.  However, simple randomization is not adequate to provide robust security performance.  The ability to randomize while ensuring the maximum amount of risk is mitigated given a limited set of resources will ensure that security elements deployed in some systemic manner achieve their maximum security value as a whole.    

The Transportation Security Administration Office of Risk Management and Strategic Innovation requires development of a game-theory based simulation with the capability of being able to randomize in a risk-efficient manner of security elements being deployed. The tool supports crisis action/incident management actions during real-world contingencies as well as training and exercise events. The goal is to enable development and prioritization of risk mitigation measures with the best combination of effectiveness (against the broadest range of risks), flexibility, cost, and minimal impact on commerce and civil liberties.   

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to award, based on best value, a hybrid Fixed Price and Labor Hour contract with an anticipated base period of twelve (12) months and four (4) twelve-month option periods. 

Full and open competition is anticipated, using NAICS code 541511, with an SBA size standard of $23 million.  The solicitation number will be HSTS03-08-R-RMS019). The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted only on FEDBIZOPPS http://www.fbo.gov.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments. It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of the solicitation and any amendments that may follow.  Solicitation HSTS03-08-R-RMS019 is tentatively scheduled to be available at http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about July 17, 2008.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The Behavioral and Rehabilitation Technology Branch, National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the Agenzia Retionale Sanita of the Regione Toscana, a component of the Reginal Health Authority of Tuscany in Italy. The purpose of the contract is to create a rehabilitation research data resource entitled Community Assessment Rehabilitation Experiment (CARE). A pilot study to examine adaptive physical activity was initiated by the Instituto Superiore di Sanita as part of the research project "Obtaining Optimal Functional Recovery and Efficient Managed Care for the Chronic Stroke Population" within the framework of the 2003 Memorandum of Understanding between the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services and Italy's Ministry of Health. The study included a community intervention program that was initiated in the Tuscan Region by Dr. Francesco Benvenuti and Dr. Laura Tramonti. The program's impact included safety of the intervention, improvement of gait and balance function and reduction in participants' depression. Community access remains a key issue in translating research results of individuals with chronic conditions who have participated in an exercise regime. The pilot provided an important step in translating the growing evidence regarding the health benefits of exercise for stroke survivors into a sustainable community model that was safe, feasible and efficacious in improving walking speed, and community ambulation. The intervention program demonstrated it has the potential to improve health outcomes and reduce health care costs associated with chronic stroke in an aging population through reducing cardiovascular risk factors associated with a sedentary lifestyle. However, confirmation of the reduction of costs in health care will require implementation of a community intervention program on a large scale. There are approximately 2,500 individuals in the Tuscan Region who suffer a stroke annually who would be eligible to participate in an expanded study. The Regional Health System completed a pilot study with 40 individuals in the intervention group and 38 individuals in the control group; it will serve as a model to be expanded. The effort involves the leadership of several different Italian Govermental Health groups including: Office of Tuscana Predictive and Preventive Medicine (Andrea Leto); Technology Assessment Office (Alessandro Reggiani); Scuola Superiore Universitaria Sant" Anna of Pisa (Sabrina Nuti); and the Dipartimento Technologie e Salute (Velio Macellari) lead by Dr. Laura Tramonti, General Director of the Agenzia Regionale Sanita of the Region Toscana. The afore mentioned components have worked with the Agenzia Regionale Sanita of the Regione Toscana and have the experience and necessary affiliations to obtain the data records needed to create the rehibilitation research database. They have completed a pilot study demonstrating applicable data management necessary to link the elements that are required to accomplish the rehabilitation data resource. In addition, the group has developed proprietary software to organize the data. The purpose of the proposed project is to expand this pilot into a computerized rehabilitation research data base that will link separate rehabilitation data components such as pre and post health measures of individuals with a chronic condition (e.g., stroke or back pain, etc.) participating in low cost interventions (e.g. adaptive physical activity) in the community with health services and drug utilization information. Expanded support from NICHD will include study components such as, 1) Establishment of a small Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC); 2) expansion of an existing computer based information system; 3) translation of a standardized outcome measure (e.g. SIS, PROMIS); 4) implementation of a telephone interview in the Tuscan region; 5) creation of a patient data file; and, 6) support for collaborative interactions for individuals with chronic conditions. If there are sources who feel they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting information required in Numbered Note 22 within 45 days of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(i), HHSAR 306.302-1(a) (2) (i) B and C. No collect calls will be accepted. Any source who deems themselves capable of doing the above work should submit an original and two (2) copies of your capability statement (and an electronic copy to ls59u@nih.gov), within 45 days from the date of the publication of this announcement to: Mrs. Lynn Salo, Contracting Officer, NICHD CMB, NIDDK, NIH, 6100 Executive Building, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510 (or overnight courier: 6100 Executive Blvd., Rockville, Maryland 20852).

Set Aside:	N/A	Contracting Office AddressDepartment of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Mental Health, Contracts Management Branch 6001 Executive Blvd, Rm 8154, MSC 9661, Bethesda, MD, 20892-9661, UNITED STATES DescriptionThe National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, one award to each of the seven clinical sites indentified as the MTA Group. The MTA Group consists of the following: (1) NYU Child Study Center, NY, NY; (2) New York State Psychiatric Institute, NY, NY; (3) University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA; (4) University of Pittsburgh, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, Pittsburgh, PA; (5) University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA; (6) McGill University, Montreal Children's Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada and (7) Duke University, Durham, NC. Each award will consist of three base years and two, twelve-month option years. These contracts will allow for an extended follow-up on the subjects who participated in the initial MTA study and the normative control group by providing for the collection of follow-up data, the transfer of that data to a data management center and recommendations about which statistical analysis to conduct on the follow-up data collected. As ADHD is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, it is important to collect long-term data on the effects of treatment. The MTA Group offers a unique opportunity because it contains a large number of well diagnosed and characterized children who were randomly assigned to receive different treatments for an extended period of time, and a matched control group, at different geographical sites. The authority to conduct negotiations with only one source (the MTA Group or 7 sites) is 41U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) and HHSAR 306-302-1(a)(2)(ii). The MTA Group has uniquie capabilities to perform the services required by this acquisition. Foremost, this Group has access to a large number of children who have been treated for ADHD in a controlled trial. Over the past eight years, these sites have worked to recruit, evaluate, and treat a large sample of children with ADHD, a matched control group, and their families. The investigators, at these sites, have established and successfully maintained over the years therapeutic relationships with these families and their children. The investigators have remained in contact with most of the study participants through periodic re-evaluations. Considering the unique personal and treatment relationships that have been established over time between the investigators and these families, it is not feasible to have another contractor go through the process of establishing new working relationships with these families in order to collect the necessary follow-up data. Based on historical data from other studies, it is known that a large number of families would not participate in a non-treatment follow-up study if the follow-up study is conducted by a contractor who had not been directly involved in their initial treatment. This would result in decreasing the amount of data collected and compromise the statistical validity of the follow-up study. Based on these considerations, it is determined that a full and open competitive award is not deemed to be in the Government's best interest for this acquisition. See Number Note 22. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR QUOTATIONS. No Contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to: Roshawn Simpson, Contract Specialist, via email: rsimpson@nida.nih.gov. TELEPHONE AND FACSIMILE REQUESTS OR INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries, Miami, FL., has a requirement for services to provide a vessel and operational support. A vessel service charter is required to recover 2 passive acoustic auto-detection buoys in shallow waters off northern Florida and southern Georgia to detect vocalizations of the critically endangered North Atlantic Right Whale. Right whales occupy these areas during winter months and begin to leave during early March. This project is a pilot study designed to assess the capability of acoustic auto-detection buoys to operate successfully in waters of the mid-Atlantic. The buoys must be recovered for refurbishment and repaired prior to redeployment in October. The buoy system being recovered requires a vessel with relatively large aft deck space and a crane and other equipment capable of recovering and safely handling oceanographic moorings. The vessel crew must have experience in the deployment and recovery of oceanographic moorings to ensure both safety and effective recovery of technical equipment. Close proximity of the vessel homeport to the buoy locations is also critical to limit the amount of time spent in transit. The R/V Savannah is the only known vessel meeting the requirements for this project. It has sufficient deck space and dockside facilities to safely handle the equipment. It is available during the required time frame for this project in late July. Savannah Specifications: Length 92', Beam 27' ,Draft 8', H.P 2x450, Speed 6.9kn, Range 2400 mi, Endurance 10d. The R/V Savannah's port location is close to the location sites of these buoys, minimizing the distance, time, and cost required to recover the buoys. Using a vessel with inappropriate capabilities in terms of deck space or weight capacity would be impractical or unsafe. In addition, inappropriate handling of the equipment increases the risks of breakage or the loss of the equipment (valued at $300,000). Using another vessel located far away from the deployment site would result in increased transit costs and increase the risk of mission failure due to inclement weather. The operation will be conducted during two consecutive days in July 2008. Skidaway Institute of Oceanography is the only known source that meets these requirements. The vessel must have sufficient deck space, a crane, and other equipment capable of recovering and safely handling oceanographic moorings. The mooring assembly requires a large area on the aft deck to support deployment. R/V Interested firms must provide detailed specifications of the proposed charter vessel. Demonstrate prior experience of the Captain and support crews' ability in the recovering of buoys and handling scientific equipment. Documentation must be received within 10 calendars days after publication of this notice. The Government will evaluate the documentation and determine the feasibility of obtaining competition among sources that have the ability to meet the Government's requirements providing the best value. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. The NAICS code for this action is 541990. The Central Region Administrative Division (CRAD), The government requires that all contractors doing business with the government must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number.

<DESC>PLAN OF WORK

Scope of Contract
The scope of this contract is to procure oblique angle digital video imagery from an aerial perspective that is synchronized with a GPS track of the entire length of the Sevier River (approximately 425 miles).  The video imagery and GPS track shall be used by NRCS for interpretive analysis and extraction of data by means of interpretation and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies.  The data collected includes but is not limited to information about streambank erosion, riparian vegetation, water turbidity, and hydrologic function.

Introduction
The contractor is responsible for furnishing oblique angle, high resolution video imagery from an aerial perspective with a synchronized GPS track in accordance with the requirements, specifications, terms, and conditions specified herein.

Technical Requirements and Specifications

The technical requirements and specifications described in this plan of work define the essential elements in securing high quality video imagery.  Any deviation from these specifications may cause increased time and effort in using the imagery as intended.

Delivery and Performance

The materials to be furnished hereunder shall be delivered, all transportation charges paid by the contractor, to:
USDA NRCS c/o Shane Green
Wallace F. Bennett Federal Building
125 South State Street, Room 4418
Salt Lake City, Utah 84138-1100

Quality Control

Quality control shall be exercised by the contractor continuously throughout the performance of the contract.  Procedures shall be developed to assure that all the video imagery and synchronized GPS tracks are delivered in accordance with the delivery schedule and at the required level of quality.  


Location of Work
The subject of the video imagery and synchronized GPS track is the Sevier River from Paiute Reservoir to past Delta (contact Contracting Officer Steve Latimer, steve.latimer@ut.usda.gov, for map).  There are approximately 425 linear miles of river to procure video imagery for.

Labor and Materials
The contractor shall furnish all materials, equipment, transportation, superintendence, and labor as required herein.  The contractor shall execute and finish the video imagery services for the project specified and shall deliver to NRCS all materials called for in the section.

Size and Perspective of Video Imagery
The video imagery to be procured is to be oblique (approximately 30 degrees forward from vertical) from an aerial perspective.  The width of the frame needs to capture from 2 to 4 widths of the river channel on either side of the Sevier River (a total of 5 to 9 channel widths).  The video camera will be capable of recording high resolution digital video images.  Continuous real time will be displayed on one corner of the video frame, not to obscure the main portion of the image.

Synchronization of Video Imagery with the GPS track 
A continuous GPS track will be recorded during the entire filming operation.  The times in the GPS track and the video camera will be precisely synchronized, allowing the NRCS to determine the geographic location of any frame in the video by matching the time in the video frame with the time in the GPS track.

Equipment Requirements
Any equipment (aircraft, GPS and cameras) proposed to be used by the contractor must be approved for use by the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative.

Aircraft
All aircraft used in the performance of the work under this contract shall be maintained and operated in accordance with all regulations required by the US Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  
Helicopter and pilot must qualify to carry NRCS employee by meeting “Safety of Air Transportation on Official Work”, from NRCS’s “360 General Manual, Part 420, Subpart L.” The design of the aircraft shall be such that when the camera is mounted with all its parts within the outer structure, an unobstructed field of view is obtained.  The field of view shall be shielded from the exhaust gasses, oil, effluence, and air turbulence. Glass, plastic, or other window material shall not be interposed between the camera or digital image system and the ground to be imaged unless authorized by the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative.

Video Camera and mount
Helicopter must have an exterior camera mount that is motion compensated and vibration free such as a “Foley” mount.  The mount needs to be able to pan and zoom.  If the helicopter has it’s own video camera the video output must be of broadcast quality or higher (520 lines resolution full color) and recorded on mini DV tape or video hard drive.  If it does not have it’s own camera the mount must be able to carry a Sony HDV professional camera using Mini DV tape (camera and tapes supplied by the NRCS in this case)

Navigation System
The aircraft shall have onboard, operational, and integrated Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver with a FAA certified antenna for recording the track of the video imagery.  The GPS shall be able to record a track with a component of continuous time.  The GPS shall be able to receive real time differential correction signals where available.

Video Image Capture Conditions
Video imagery shall be acquired during conditions when well defined, high detail images will be resolved.  It is preferred that the skies be clear, free from smoke, clouds, cloud shadows, and excessive haze.  Due to the overriding need to acquire quality imagery within the specified period, it may be necessary to acquire some imagery that is outside the above requirements.  The contractor is permitted to exercise judgment in acquiring images.  NRCS reserves the right to reject imagery if it is impossible to be used for the intended purpose of interpretation for data collection.

Video Image Capture Period
The video image capture period for this project shall be during times when riparian vegetation is actively growing.  Generally, the date range would be June 1 to September 1, depending on the elevation.

Sun Angle Requirement
NRCS desires that video imagery be acquired only during the portion of the day when the sun angle exceeds the minimum of 30 degrees above the horizon.  However, to expedite the acquisition within the shortest number of days possible, NRCS will accept a sun angle of not less than 20 degrees, provided the imagery does not have extensive shadows that preclude interpretation for data collection.

Flight Plan Requirements
The contractor shall obtain oblique angle high resolution digital video imagery from an aerial perspective that is synchronized with a GPS track of the entire length of the Sevier River (approximately 425 miles).

Project Areas to obtain Video Imagery from
The subject of the video imagery and synchronized GPS track is the Sevier River from Paiute Reservoir to past Delta (see attached map).  There are approximately 425 linear miles of river to procure video imagery for.  

Site/Area Coverage
The video imagery to be procured is to be oblique (tilted to approximately 30 degrees forward from vertical) from an aerial perspective.  The width of the frame needs to capture from 2 to 4 widths of the channel on either side of the Sevier River (a total of 5 to 9 channel widths).  The video camera will be capable of recording high resolution digital video images.  Continuous real time will be displayed on one corner of the video frame.

Flight Direction
All flights shall be parallel with the river channel and be as continuous as possible.  Flight direction can be either upstream or downstream at the contractors discretion, but only one or the other for the video capture in it’s entirety.  

Flight Altitudes and Speed
The aerial perspective should be gained at the lowest possible altitude while conforming with the site/area coverage requirements, camera lens constraints, and safety considerations.  Appropriate speeds for the video capture will be as fast as possible at the contractor’s discretion.

Materials to be Delivered

Medium for Digital Video Imagery and GPS track
If the contractor’s camera is used, the video capture will be transferred to DVD(s) for delivery to the NRCS.  If the NRCS’s camera is used, the NRCS will maintain backups and management of the camera recording media.  The GPS track shall be recorded to an electronic medium such as a DVD or CD for delivery to the NRCS.

The Naval Air Systems Command, Aircrew Endurance Program seeks interested vendors to support production of a new man mounted survival item/body armor carrier. This carrier will be a replacement for the currently fielded survival vest and body armor worn by USN and USMC operators of H-46, H-53, UH-1, H-60, V-22, and AH-1 aircraft. Competitive production contract(s) to a Navy specification will be awarded in 2010. This notice is to announce an industry day to be held 19 June 2008 so that potential suppliers may be prepared to present webbings, hardware components, harness components, and fabrics that may be incorporated into the manufacturing specification to enhance the capability of the system. The USN intends to present design and integration requirements as well as system design concepts during this Industry Day. Participation in this Industry Day is not mandatory and will not preclude any interested vendors from participation in the subsequent procurement. 

Specific hardware components sought include but are not limited to: webbing closures, pocket attachment hardware, pocket closures, garment closures, rip-cords, and friction adjusters that can be blind-operated with a wetted, gloved, hand; that will operate in the sandy conditions of the Middle East as well as wet rainy conditions; that are durable in extreme heat and cold, that have a matte finish; that have a 66 lb hardware retention strength, are snag resistant; that exhibit salt-fog corrosion resistance, high heat resistance, flame resistance; are  lightweight, low bulk, consistent multiple use, easily replaceable, and that have no parts or components that can accidentally detach or shed under rotor wash, high wind, or light impact.

Specific fabrics and tapes/ webbings sought include but are not limited to those appropriate for load-carrying  (e.g., 7-lb hard armor plate, 10-lb soft armor, 40 pounds of survival items). Such fabrics must be flame and high-heat resistant, and ideally, highly air permeable.  A fabric that can provide a slick yet durable lining for the hard armor plate to allow it to slip in and out of a durable outer pocket is also desired.   

Specific harness components sought include but are not limited to webbings, fasteners, friction adjusters, and closures that comply with ANSI Z359 for fall protection, and are flame resistant, high heat resistant.  Webbing fasteners shall meet not only all requirements of the hardware components above but in addition, be able to be quickly disconnected under tension, e.g., an aviator whose harness is snagged in an underwater emergency. 

Vendors may prepare a list of concerns and questions they may have regarding the requirements for this industry day. No written responses will be provided from the Government. Vendors are encouraged to bring product samples, test results, and evidence of Berry amendment compliance. Vendors are strongly encouraged to avoid the use of presentation software, and to avoid marketing and advertising content. Vendors are requested to provide the name of their company, organization, and/or division group. Vendor participation is limited to no more than 2 people per company. Vendors will have the opportunity to schedule an individual appointment for that day with Mary Marseglia of STV Inc beginning May 27, 2008 (301-862-2344). Each appointment will be no longer than 20 minutes in duration. The purpose of the appointment is to allow vendors to ask and answer questions in a closed forum. All questions and answers will be recorded and released to the general public. 

This is not a notice of formal solicitation. Requirements for delivery schedules, quantities, and qualification of units have not been established. However suggestions that may assist the Navy in preparing their solicitation are welcome. 

In order to request an appointment for participation in this Industry Day, interested parties shall contact Ms. Marseglia by electronic mail at mary.margseglia@stvinc.com only; no phone calls or other forms of contact shall be used.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Aircrew Endurance Program seeks interested vendors to support production of a new man mounted survival item/body armor carrier. This carrier will be a replacement for the currently fielded survival vest and body armor worn by USN and USMC operators of H-46, H-53, UH-1, H-60, V-22, and AH-1 aircraft. Competitive production contract(s) to a Navy specification may occur in the 2010 timeframe. This notice is to announce an industry day to be held 19 June 2008 so that potential suppliers (more specifically defined below) may be prepared to present webbings, hardware components, harness components, and fabrics that may be incorporated into the manufacturing specification to enhance the capability of the system. The USN intends to present design and integration requirements as well as system design concepts during this Industry Day. Participation in this Industry Day is not mandatory and will not preclude any interested vendors (as defined below) from participation in the subsequent procurement. This notice is intended for component manufacturers, such as weavers/knitters/spinners of fabric, fabric netting, fabric mesh, webbing, tapes, bindings, and/or sewing threads; and formers of textile, metal, plastic, and/or composite fasteners, closures, connectors, adjusters, and pulls. This announcement is NOT intended for vendors or manufacturers of pocketry, flotation, gear carriage vests, hydration, cooling/heating technologies, armor carriers, armor hard plate, fragmentation soft plate, harnesses, webgear, cushion covers, other man-mounted clothing, or any other prime vendors outsourcing to the aforementioned component manufacturers. Specific hardware components sought include but are not limited to: webbing closures, pocket attachment hardware, pocket closures, garment closures, rip-cords, and friction adjusters that can be blind-operated with a wetted, gloved, hand; that will operate in the sandy conditions of the Middle East as well as wet rainy conditions; that are durable in extreme heat and cold, that have a matte finish; that have a 66 lb hardware retention strength, are snag resistant; that exhibit salt-fog corrosion resistance, high heat resistance, flame resistance; are lightweight, low bulk, consistent multiple use, easily replaceable, and that have no parts or components that can accidentally detach or shed under rotor wash, high wind, or light impact. Specific fabrics and tapes/ webbings sought include but are not limited to those appropriate for load-carrying (e.g., 7-lb hard armor plate, 10-lb soft armor, 40 pounds of survival items). Such fabrics must be flame and high-heat resistant, and ideally, highly air permeable. A fabric that can provide a slick yet durable lining for the hard armor plate to allow it to slip in and out of a durable outer pocket is also desired. Specific harness components sought include but are not limited to webbings, fasteners, friction adjusters, and closures that comply with ANSI Z359 for fall protection, and are flame resistant, high heat resistant. Webbing fasteners shall meet not only all requirements of the hardware components above but in addition, be able to be quickly disconnected under tension, e.g., an aviator whose harness is snagged in an underwater emergency. Interested component manufacturers (as described above) may be prepared to present product samples of soft and hard components that may enhance the capability of an integrated gear carriage /ballistic/fragmentation hoist/ fall arrest system currently in development. These soft and hard components have the potential to be incorporated into a Dept of Navy system detail specification. Vendors may prepare a list of concerns and questions they may have regarding the requirements for this industry day. No written responses will be provided from the Government. Vendors are encouraged to bring product samples, test results, and evidence of Berry amendment compliance. Vendors are strongly encouraged to avoid the use of presentation software, and to avoid marketing and advertising content. Vendors are requested to provide the name of their company, organization, and/or division group. Vendor participation is limited to no more than 2 people per company. Vendors will have the opportunity to schedule an individual appointment for that day beginning May 27, 2008. Each appointment will be no longer than 20 minutes in duration. The purpose of the appointment is to allow vendors to ask and answer questions in a closed forum. All questions and answers will be recorded and released to the general public. This is not a notice of formal solicitation. Potential requirements for delivery schedules, quantities, and qualification of units have not been established. However suggestions that may assist the Navy in preparing a potential solicitation are welcome. In order to request an appointment for participation in this Industry Day, interested parties shall contact Ms. Marseglia by electronic mail at mary.marseglia@stvinc.com only; no phone calls or other forms of contact shall be used. Industry Day will start at 830 a.m. and end no later than 4 p.m. on Thursday, the 19th of June 2008.

BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA)Universal Electromagnetic Launcher  
This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Interested parties are invited to respond to this synopsis.  No hard copy version of this announcement will be made available. The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offers the best overall value to the Government.  One or more technology areas may receive no funding.  Also, the Government reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  In that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this BAA is not allowable as a direct charge to any contract resulting from this BAA or to any other Government contract.  Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.  
Funds may not be available for all requirements under this BAA.  No contract awards will be made until appropriated funds are available from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  The Government may incrementally fund contracts awarded from this BAA as provided by FAR 52.232-22, Limitation of Funds. Most contracts awarded are anticipated to be 24 to 36 months in duration. To facilitate incremental funding, submissions shall include the cost and schedule by a task-phased structure organized by fiscal year (October through September) with clear exit criteria, and shall be inclusive of all work to complete the effort including any options. It is anticipated that the entire effort will be negotiated with the initial contract award.  
This BAA will remain open for approximately ninety days from the date of publication or until replaced by a successor BAA, which may occur at any time.  Proposals may be submitted at any time during this period.  
The Government encourages nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI) (HBCU/MIs), women-owned businesses, and Historically Underutilized Business (HUB) zone enterprises as well as large businesses and Government agencies to submit proposals for consideration and/or to join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of the BAA will be set-aside for these special entities because of the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research and development in any specific requirement area.  The final determination will be made based on the relevance of the proposal to requirement, individual technical merits of the proposal and budget constraints within the mission priorities.  
A three-step proposal selection process will be used for this solicitation to minimize cost and effort of prospective offerors.  
Step One- will consist of an Industry Day on 15 July 2008 where the technology and applications to be developed will be presented and to allow prospective offerors an opportunity to ask general questions.  Offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to contractually bind or otherwise commit the Government.Since no Contracting Officer will be present during this Industry Day, nothing discussed is contractually binding to the government in any way.

DESCRIPTION OF OPPORTUNITY.  The Department of Defense (DOD) solicits proposals for the application of HEEL technology to the areas of low speed cold missile launch. The efforts will lead to the demonstration of a representative missile model launch. The missile mass model shall be representative in volume, diameter, height, and weight of the largest surface launched missiles in current fleet inventory. The demonstrators must include as a minimum the projectile or missile model, launcher tube, launcher mount, energy storage, solid-state inverters, data acquisition, and software for motor control. The demonstrator must be completed within 24 to 48 months from award and addresses the following:
(1)  Electromagnetic Missile Launcher demonstrator to include a preliminary design that is compatible with current naval surface launcher system in regards to form and fit.
ELECTROMAGNETIC MISSILE LAUNCHER DEMONSTRATOR REQUIREMENTS.
(1)  A HEEL based Electromagnetic Missile Launcher (EMML) is a true AC TLIM technology that has the ability to vault a missile up to a safe altitude before the thrust is initiated from the missile propulsion system. A EMML system is envisioned to be comprised of nine major components: 1) a non conducting TLIM canister holding the stator coils of the linear motor; 2) a device that accelerates the missile to be vaulted and represents the armature of the linear motor; 3) Solid-state inverters to drive the stators AC coils; 4) energy storage; 5) armature position and velocity measuring capability; 6) motor control software and hardware; 7) the projectile, which in this case is a sub-scale low mass projectile, a sub-scale larger mass projectile, and a full size full mass surface launched missile replica; 8) launcher tube mounting structure; and 9) data acquisition and reduction system.  
(2)  EMML Requirements.  Proposals are envisioned to be a three-phase demonstration approach: 1) medium diameter sub-scale low mass launcher system; 2) a sub-scale large mass launcher system; and 3) a full size and mass launcher system to include preliminary system CAD design. It is anticipated that phases one and two would be the same launcher system with different projectiles; since this would be the most economical approach. 
(a)  Sub-scale low mass launcher.  This launcher would be used to develop the basic motor control capability and demonstrate the controlled launch of a low mass projectile. The proposed system will have the minimum specifications: i.)  The inner radius of the launch tube must be no less than five inches in diameter;ii) The TLIM launcher tube will not be longer than six meters (m) in length;iii) Must demonstrate a projectile exit velocity of 60 meters per second (m/s) or greater;iv) The demonstration projectile must be at least 50 kilograms (kg).
(b)  Sub-scale large mass launcher. The launcher developed in phase one could be used to launch large mass projectile.  The proposed system will have the minimum specifications:i) The inner radius of the launch tube must be no less than five inches in diameter;ii) The TLIM launcher tube will not be longer than six meters (m) in length;iii) The projectile mass must be at least 500 kg;iv)  Must demonstrate a projectile exit velocity of 45 m/s or greater.
(c)  Full-scale full mass surface launched missile replica launch canister. The launcher would be a full length demonstrator capable of launching a full up round replica at full mass and a preliminary CAD design for launching system capable of holding the TLIM canister that is compatible with current naval surface launching system form and fit.  The proposed system will have the minimum specifications:i)   The armature must be able to securely hold the missile replica until released for launch;ii)   The projectile will be an unguided inert full sized and full mass missile full up round replica;iii)  If a bucket is used it must be captured within the launch canister;iv)  The missile replica projectile must not be damaged from launch and the projectile must be reusable to support multiple launch tests and demonstrations; v)  Must demonstrate a projectile exit velocity of 45 m/s or greater with acceleration not to exceed 20 Gees.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), this is a Request for Information (RFI).  (SECTION 1) GENERAL INFORMATION: The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport, RI (NUWCNPT) issues this Request for Information (RFI) to aid the United States Navy in determining if there is sufficient industrial expertise and interest to proceed with a competitive procurement for the Common Electrical Hull Penetrator (CEHP) common diploop cable (CDC) described below.  This RFI is intended to identify concepts and sources for a CEHP CDC that can survive in a submarine sail environment.  The function of the CDC is to provide a reliable path for the transfer of critical information between outboard masts/sensors and the inboard processing equipment during at-sea missions and pier-side testing.  (SECTION 2) BACKROUND: In January 2007, NAVSEA 073R directed the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport (NUWCNPT) to begin investigating the feasibility of a Common Electrical Hull Penetrator (CEHP) to be used with all future submarine Communications, Imaging and Electronic Warfare (CI&EW) antennas and sensors.  The electrical hull penetrator (EHP) is the SUBSAFE boundary between the masts/sensors in the submarine sail and the inboard processing equipment.  The resulting study determined that with current technology, the use of a CEHP is possible.  In March 2008, NAVSEA 073R directed NUWCNPT to begin investigating near term changes to current systems and future system developments to aid in the design of a CEHP.  In addition, NUWCNPT was to look at the feasibility of a common diploop cable (CDC).  The diploop cable provides the connection between the mast/sensor and the EHP.  The diploop cable is fed through a series of rollers in either the Universal Modular Mast (UMM) or Mast Mechanical Group (MMG) which raises and lowers the masts/sensors.  Thus, constant flexing and bending of the cable should be expected.  The CEHP CDC is expected to be a purpose built, mixed conductor cable assembly consisting of coax, #12-#16 AWG copper, and fiber optic conductors, both Single Mode (SM) and Polarization Maintaining (PM).  Standard construction and pressure balanced cables will be considered.  (SECTION 3) TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CDC:  (1) The cable assembly shall not be degraded by active or passive corrosion due to leakage currents or galvanic action over a 20 year service life.  (2) CDC shall consist of the following: Qty(3) #12 AWG TSP – 6 conductors, Qty(4) #16 AWG TSP – 8 conductors, Qty(2)#16 AWG TST – 6 conductors, Qty(3) Coax – 3 conductors, Qty(1) #16 AWG Single – 1 conductor, Qty(9) Fiber – 9 conductors.  (3) Coax cables shall be IW 2303 or industry equivalent.  (4) The nine fiber conductors shall consist of 2 polarization maintaining (PM) fibers and 7 single mode (SM) fibers.  Mil-spec components should be used where appropriate.  Commercial telecom proven components and ruggedized components that have been developed for military applications shall be used when their specifications exceed the current Mil-spec or when no appropriate Mil-spec exists.  (5) CDC shall be prepared in a manner that offers maximum flexibility with a circular core cross section, minimum amount of twist under loading and would avoid conductor defects such as kinks and twists which would shorten cable life.  Use of fillers would be acceptable.  Circular cross section should not be altered by exposure to pressure or other testing.  (6) EMI Shield shall consist of two layers of #36 AWG tinned copper braid with 95% optical coverage, minimum.  (7) CDC shall be capable of reliably operating after being cycled through a UMM and MMGbends for a minimum of 10,000 cycles.  (8) The cable outer jacket shall prevent water entry under a continuous hydrostatic pressure of 1000 PSI (sea water environment).  This hydrostatic pressure shall have no detrimental effect on cable performance or electrical characteristics.  (9) The cable will be over molded with a polyurethane jacket of sufficient thickness to be resilient and resistant to tear, punctures or similar damage.  (10) The outer diameter of the cable shall not exceed 1.45 inches.  (11) The cable shall meet the cold bend requirements of MIL-C-24643 for cables having a diameter greater than .5 inches.  The conditioning temperature shall be -28C, +0C, -2C.  (12) The insulation resistance between mutually insulated conductors (excluding coaxial cables) and between any conductor and shield grounds shall be 1000 mega ohms minimum when tested in accordance with MIL-STD-202, Method 302, at 500VDC.  (13) The cable assembly conductors shall withstand, without insulation breakdown, 1000 Vrms between any mutual conductors (including shields).  (14) The operating temperature shall be -54C to +65C and the non-operating temperature shall be -62C to +71C, In addition, the cable should be capable of withstanding without failure naval vibration and underwater explosion environments. (15) Referenced Documents: PPD 802-6335747 Shock Qualification for Submarine External Components, S9320-AM-PRO-020/MLDG Molding and Inspection Procedure.  (SECTION 4) REQUESTED INFORMATION: This RFI is intended to gather information regarding possible technical solutions and their characteristics.  NUWCNPT’s goal is to use the information collected to develop an acquisition strategy for a competitive best value acquisition.  Information desired at this time includes: (a) Proposed technical solution with/without modeling and simulation (b)Cost estimates (NRE and production) (c) Development schedule (including prototype, modeling and simulation, and production) (d) Minimum production runs  (e) Production lead times (f) Relevant experience (g) Exceptions – Identify requirements specified that will not be met (h) Identify any alternative solutions that could fulfill the Navy’s objectives. Include the following contact information with your submission:  company name, address, and primary engineering and program management points of contact (including name, phone number, and email address).

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice For
DHS TSA Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing 
Adjudication Services Support

INTRODUCTION
This is a Sources Sought Notice for the Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security Administration, Transportation Threat Assessment & Credentialing (TTAC), Office of Security Threat Assessment Operations (OSTAO) to provide support adjudicating Security Threat Assessments for selected transportation security programs.

BACKGROUND
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is responsible for protecting the nation’s transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement of people and commerce.  The Office of Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing, Adjudication Services (AS) support task conducts Security Threat Assessments (STAs) for individuals applying for credentials or access to the nation’s transportation system. A STA conducted by TSA consists of an automated biographic and biometric background check of criminal records, immigration records and intelligence-related information. It includes reviewing this background information to determine potential disqualifications for criminal offenses, immigration issues, links to terrorism, and/or mental competencies based on a fingerprint-based Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) criminal history records check (CHRC), a check for any open wants and warrants, an intelligence-related check, and an immigration/citizenship status check.  In support of the TSA mission, the TTAC STA adjudicators are responsible for conducting STAs for every transportation worker seeking to obtain an endorsement, credential, and/or privilege in a number of programs including, but not limited to:
1.	Aviation Worker (AW) Program;
2.	Hazardous Materials Endorsement (HME) Program for Commercial Driver’s Licenses (CDLs);
3.	Indirect Air Carrier/Air Cargo (IAC) Program ;
4.	Certified Cargo Screening Program (CCSP); 
5.	Registered Traveler (RT) Program; and 
6.	Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) Program.
It is anticipated that TTAC will continue to bring on new populations. In onboarding new populations, caseloads increase which may require surge support for limited durations on multiple occasions. The increase in populations will double or triple the caseloads for some duration then return to a new higher baseline. 
In some instances, adjudicators may access government or commercial databases to conduct research and obtain case information.  TTAC uses web-enabled TSA systems as primary tools for gathering, viewing and synthesizing information needed to conduct STAs and render credential decisions. TSA checks applicant information against the following databases depending on STA requirements for the specific program in order to make a credential or access decision:
•	National Crime Information Center (NCIC)
•	Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS)
•	TSA Colorado Springs Operations Center (CSOC)
•	Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlement (SAVE VIS)

OBJECTIVES
The overall objective of this Sources Sought Notice is to improve the understanding of industry capabilities and identify qualified sources to provide TTAC Adjudication Services Support.  

Business Type: Identify your business type – large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a)-certified small disadvantaged, HUBZone small, woman-owned small, very small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small – based upon North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 561611, “Investigation Services.”  The term Small Business Concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria and size standards in 13 CFR Part 121. A small business concern for the purposes of this procurement is generally defined as a business, including its affiliates, with no more than 500 employees. Responders are cautioned, however, that this is a general description only; additional standards and conditions apply. Refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19 at www.arnet.gov/far/ for additional detailed information on Small Business Size Standards.

Responding to this Sources Sought Notice does not automatically include the responder in any bidders list in the event that TTAC develops such a list.  Vendors wishing to submit a proposal to any subsequent solicitation must monitor FedBizOps for the synopsis.

This Sources Sought Notice is for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government.  This is not a solicitation.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government. 

CAPABILITIES COVERAGE
The process of conducting STAs is divided into three primary functional areas: adjudication, post-adjudication and risk assessment. Adjudication involves the initial adjudication, mid-level adjudication and senior adjudication functions in assessment of the applicant’s eligibility for the applicable credential, endorsement, or privilege. If adjudication determines that an applicant’s information reflects derogatory information that would disqualify him/her from receiving a positive STA result, an Initial Determination of Threat Assessment (IDTA) letter is generated and sent to the applicant.  The applicant must resolve the potentially disqualifying information or in some cases may request a waiver from the disqualifying condition as part of the post-adjudication process.
Post-adjudication involves the management of applicant appeal requests, waiver requests, waiver review boards, case research, Administrative Law Judge proceedings and other activities relating to providing legal due-process and redress for STA applicants.
Risk assessment involves fact-finding, investigation, and analysis of potential security threats.  Secure information technology and facilities are required to support the capabilities required in this notification.
1.	Adjudication Services:
The contractor shall review and adjudicate criminal history records checks results, immigration status, and/or mental competency based on program-specific disqualifying criteria.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS VIRGINIA (GINNY) SLAYTON @ 706-787-2019 OR virginia.slayton@us.army.mil  65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR><BR>     The Southeast Region (TRBO Reg. 3 & 4), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in countries of Puerto Rico, Honduras, and Cuba announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Blood Collection Tubes.   <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Community Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS) and the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ will result in a Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) that is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is September 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Blood Collection Tubes product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Blood Collection Tubes product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.  Point of Contact:  Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019, Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.   <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Blood Collection Tubes, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $256,820.74.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.   Submissions must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  <BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  a.) In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Blood Collection Tubes.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. <BR>a.	At a minimum, this product line consists of Blood Collection Tubes available in various tube sizes of Adult, Pediatric and Neonatal (Bullet).  Tube types include splatter and shatter proof, Safety Cap Color Coded tubes including: Coagulation, No Additive, Serum Tubes (Clot Activator, clot activator and gel), Heparin, Hematology, Molecular Diagnostics and Viral Load Detection, Glucose Tubes; Cross match Tubes; Blood Grouping Tubes; Trace Element Tubes, and ESR Tubes.  <BR>b.	Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed above. (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for the Blood Collection Tubes product line.  Provide the DAPA number with initial submission. (Vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  <BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (PV), (currently the prime vendor is Owens & Minor), for distribution of Blood Collection Tubes in the Southeast Region. (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.) Provide supporting documentation (four digit number) of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal.      <BR>4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quotes on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendors MUST provide any history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Blood Collection Tubes, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>6.	Vendor MUST provide latex safe/free products.  Vendor MUST provide a complete list of latex safe/free items supplied (catalog, etc.) in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  <BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to select MTFs for evaluation.  Vendors are required to ship their samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Literature must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 PM EST, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable and five (5)-highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 7 calendar days.  <BR>To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting.   <BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR>1.	(Patient Safety) Literature supports that the vendor can provide tubes and lids that fit multi-sample needles, safety needle collection systems and holders.  <BR>a.	The Southeast region MTFs utilizes numerous types of methods to collect blood with multi-sample needles, safety needle systems and holders.  The vendor selected must be able to support all of these methods with their Blood Collection Tubes.<BR>b.	Clinician will review the Literature provided and verify that the vendor can support provide tubes and lids that fit multi-sample needles, safety needle collection systems and holders<BR>2.	(Patient Safety) Literature supports that the vendor can provide FDA approved Blood Collection Tubes.  <BR>a.	The products must be FDA approved (FDA 21 CFR part 820, also known as the Quality System Regulation, QRS) which outlines current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and service of all finished devices intended for human use. These requirements are meant to ensure that medical devices such as Blood Collection Tubes are safe.<BR>b.	Clinician will review the Literature provided and verify that the vendor is FDA approved.  <BR>3.	(Patient Safety) Literature supports that Blood Collection Tubes can be used with equipment that uses cap-piercing. <BR>a.	The closures design must allow for repeated needle puncture and reseal, and must permit easy removal of the closure as recommended by the tube manufacture. It shall be capable of retaining a vacuum for the stated shelf life if the tubes method of collection is by means of evacuation only.<BR>b.	Clinician will review the Literature provided and verify that the tubes provided by the vendor can be used with equipment that uses cap piercing.<BR>4.	(Patient Safety) Literature supports that lid colors are consistent with industry for test performed.  <BR>a.	National standards have been identified for Blood Collection Tubes and in order to be JCAHO approved these standards must be met with the standard lid colors required.<BR>b.	Clinician will review the Literature provided and verify that the vendor provides lid colors that are consistent with industry for test performed. <BR>5.	(Patient Safety) Literature supports that it offers protection against blood splatter.<BR>a.	The Blood Collection Tubes must have and be able to prevent splattering of any and all human blood specimens.  <BR>b.	Clinician will review the Literature provided and verify that the vendor provides Blood Collection Tubes that offers protection against blood splatters. <BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold (-- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores) as determined by the CPT, will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors will be provided 7 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the 7th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs); (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (3) Potential Cost Avoidance (This is included as a reporting Matrix); (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 25 JULY 2008 5:00 PM EDT.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS VIRGINIA (GINNY) SLAYTON @ 706-787-2019 OR virginia.slayton@us.army.mil   65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR><BR>     The Southeast Region (TRBO Reg. 3 & 4), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in the countries of Honduras and Cuba, and the territory of Puerto Rico announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Incentive Spirometers. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Community Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS) and the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the Prime Vendor Program.  The RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is October 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Incentive Spirometers product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Incentive Spirometers product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.   <BR>Point of Contact:  Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019, Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.   <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Incentive Spirometers, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $33,944.42.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.   Submissions must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required certifications & documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  a.) In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. <BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Incentive Spirometer products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.<BR>a.	At a minimum this includes Incentive Spirometers that are disposable volumetric exercisers (2500 ml to 5000 ml), flow incentive spirometers with adjustable flow ranges, both with adjustable goal indicators.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes listed.  <BR>b.	Vendor MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type.  (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for the Incentive Spirometer product line.  Provide the DAPA number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  <BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, the prime vendor is Owens & Minor) for Incentive Spirometers in the Southeast Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.)  Provide supporting documentation (four digit code) of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal. <BR>4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendor MUST have a local vendor representative for the Southeast Region Medical Treatment facilities to provide sufficient product implementation services and customer servicing to the multi-service regional facilities.  Vendors MUST provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with initial submittal.  <BR>6.	Vendor MUST provide all history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for Incentive Spirometer products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recall during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deem relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>7.	Vendor MUST provide products that are Latex safe/free.  Vendor MUST provide a complete list of latex safe/free items supplied (catalog, etc,) in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.<BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request literature and product sample sets from the product group to be sent to select MTFs for evaluation.  Vendors are required to ship their samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 PM EST, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical/patient care setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable and five (5)-highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 21 calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR>To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  <BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:         <BR>1.	(Encourage patients active involvement in care) The internal float device is able to move freely within inspiratory flow chamber. <BR>a.	A freely moving float device is able to be raised by patients inspired breaths.  This provides respiratory exercise. <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by three (3) trials in a clinical/patient care setting.  <BR>c.	The evaluator will turn Incentive Spirometer upside down and observe that internal float device slowly falls to the bottom of the chamber.    <BR>2.	(Encourage patients active involvement in care) Adjustable goal indicator is easy to reposition. <BR>a.	An adjustable goal indicator allows clinician and patient to assess exercise progress.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by three (3) trials in a clinical/patient care setting.<BR>c.	The evaluator will manually slide goal indicator up and down a long the side of the incentive spirometer to assure its ease of repositioning.   <BR>3.	(Encourage patients active involvement in care) Graphics indicating inspiratory volume are clearly marked on the spirometer. <BR>a.	Highly visible graphic (indicating inspiratory flow rate volume) helps patient perform and monitor their own breathing exercises without supervision.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by three (3) trials in a clinical/patient care setting.<BR>c.	The evaluator will visually observe that inspiratory flow rate volume can be clearly identified by user.<BR>       4.	 (Patient comfort) Mouthpiece fits comfortably.  <BR>a.	A tight seal of mouth piece is necessary for efficient inspiratory exercise results.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by three (3) trials in a clinical/patient care setting.<BR>c.	The evaluator will visually observe that patient is able to acquire a tight seal on mouthpiece.<BR>	<BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the actual clinical acceptability target threshold (-- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores) and/or any cluster of vendor scores as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors who have met the actual Acceptability threshold will be provided 7 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the 7th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs. (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. (4) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 25 JULY 2008 5:00 PM EDT.<BR>

<DESC>1.0	SUBJECT<BR>The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), Pharmaceutical Operations Directorate is seeking information regarding a pharmacy inventory management solution. TMA is conducting market research to determine the current capabilities of commercial applications supporting medication inventory management in all facets and phases of the medication-use process for healthcare enterprise with outpatient and inpatient pharmacy operations. <BR><BR>Responses are due to this RFI by 4:00 PM on August 1, 2008.  See section 5.0 for further information.<BR><BR>2.0	DISCLAIMER<BR>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to this RFI.  Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary, will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.<BR><BR>At this time, questions concerning the composition and requirements for a future RFP, as well as those regarding the nature of the products reviewed for this initiative will not be entertained.<BR><BR>3.0	DESCRIPTION<BR>TRICARE Management Activity, a Defense Department agency, administers the health care plan for the uniformed services, retirees and their families, serves more than 9.2 million eligible beneficiaries worldwide. The approximate 300 Military treatment facilities (MTFs) are the primary delivery portal for care augmented by a civilian provider network. Pharmacy benefits are provided through three points of service: 1) MTFs; 2) Mail order pharmacy; and 3) a retail network.  Beneficiaries are able to receive prescriptions from both military and civilian providers and fill their prescriptions at any points of service.  <BR><BR>For the MTF on-site pharmacies, the DoD is required to manage MTF pharmacy inventory in compliance with various DoD management directives and policies.  Currently, DoD manages medication inventory in a distributed framework at both the local (MTF Pharmacy) and Service level (Army, Navy, Air Force).  DoD is interested in obtaining information as to whether an integrated commercial pharmacy inventory management solution for the applicable phases of the medication-use process at individual pharmacy, hospital and enterprise levels.<BR><BR>TMA encourages responses to include information on other capabilities and functions of a commercial product that can contribute to an overall inventory management strategy for the Military Health System (MHS).  <BR><BR><BR>4.0	REQUIREMENTS<BR>This section enumerates the functional requirements for an inventory management solution:    <BR><BR>Inventory management capability.  <BR>DoD requires the capability and functionality for pharmacy inventory management at the individual pharmacy, hospital and enterprise levels.  DoD requires inventories to be maintained at the generic product level and at the NDC level.  DoD must be able to view the quantity of drugs on hand by generic product as well as by NDC at the enterprise, hospital and individual pharmacy levels, to include a parent pharmacy being able to view the inventory levels of its child pharmacies.  DoD receives inventory items based on NDCs.  The items are managed in the inventory at the generic product level until the the medication-use process phases applicable to the pharmacy are accomplished (i.e. dispensing or administration), when the inventory is decremented using the NDC.  In describing your capabilities, describe the extent to which your product accommodates DoDs inventory management process.  This capability should also include:<BR><BR>"	The ability to interface with drug wholesalers using industry standards (ASC X12, etc.) to facilitate, manage and track medication ordering. <BR>"	The ability to provide financial management capabilities, including the reconciliation of ordered, delivered and dispensed medications based on DoD pricing agreements. <BR><BR>The Government is open to alternative concepts for solutions that meet these requirements.  The Government encourages creativity and outside the box thinking in responses to this RFI.  <BR><BR>The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those requirements enumerated above.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses.<BR><BR><BR>5.0 CONTACT INFORMATION <BR><BR>Following is the Point of Contact (POC) for this RFI: Henry Gibbs <BR><BR>Please submit responses via e-mail in Microsoft Office 2000 (at a minimum) format by 4:00 PM on August 1, 2008, to henry.gibbs@tma.osd.mil<BR>   <BR>You may also submit supplemental hardcopy materials such as brochures, etc. to:<BR>Henry Gibbs, 5111 Leesburg Pike, Suite 810, Falls Church, VA 22041. <BR><BR>Point of Contact<BR><BR>Email your questions to Henry Gibbs, TRICARE Management Activity Pharmacy Operations.<BR><BR>Additional Information:<BR><BR>USAMRAA web page<BR><BR><BR>Please submit responses via e-mail in Microsoft Office 2000 (at a minimum) format by 4:00 PM on August 1, 2008, to Henry Gibbs.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (not a pre-solicitation notice pursuant to FAR Part 5) to determine the capability of potential sources and the availability of commercial sources pursuant to FAR Part 10.  The Department of Homeland Security, U. S. Coast Guard, Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic, Norfolk, VA and the United States Coast Guard Industrial Support Detachment (ISD) Mobile, Alabama is issuing this notice to identify sources capable of providing a Paint Booth to overhaul Coast Guard Buoys that range in size from 2ft in diameter by 6ft in length to the largest buoy of 9 ft in diameter and 35 ft in length..  

The Paint Booth shall meet the following criteria:  The booth shall be assembled and supplied with all required materials for operation to the degree that only minor hand tools and lifting equipment are required for assembly and installation.

An expedited schedule of this project is needed to complete investigations of the dam and to insure public safety.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 237310 and the small business size standard is not applicable as Reclamation has determined, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and FAR 6.302-2, that Tualatin Valley Irrigation District has unique qualifications for these services as TVID operates and maintains Scoggins Dam for for Reclamation and is responsible for onsite activities, including managing operations, site security, and managing site access.  TVID routinely performs similar work on the dam for operation and maintenance needs (covered by separate contract) and are familiar with the soil type and slope of the dam that need to be considered during construction.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capabilities to respond to the requirement to Susie Kramer via email at skramer@pn.usbr.gov or fax 208/378-5108.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source basis with Hexagon Metrology Inc. North America, 250 Circuit Drive North Kingstown, RI 02852 USA, for the purchase of Quindos 6 Software license. This software is to be used on a recently acquired Moore M48 Coordinate Measuring Machine(CMM). Quindos is the only software that can be run on this machine, for the following reasons:  The M48 already has a Leitz controller and this software is essentially an upgrade (the machine was previously run on Quindos 5).  Furthermore, the NIST Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory already owns two other CMMs which run on Leitz controllers and Quindos 6 software license. It is essential that all three machines are run on identical systems for part program interchangeability.   
The Government intends to solicit only this one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) because the Government has not identified any other sources that can meet the requirements specified above. Interested concerns may identify their capabilities by submitting a capability statement that clearly and unambiguously demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to provide Quindos 6 Basic Software.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Protected Resources Division located in St. Petersburg, FL intends to modify Purchase Order WC133F-07-SE-3789 for the development of a population model for threatened Elkhorn coral (Acropora Palmata), by adding an additional 12 month to the period of performance which will extend the period of performance through December 31, 2009 with the existing contractor, Tali Vardi, located in La Jolla, CA based on the following reasons 1) In order to complete the model and provide the NMFS Protected Resources Division with a usable product, a second year must be added; 2) The existing contractor is the sole owner of the initial model that has been developed to date, it would represent an unnecessary burden to put this expansion out for competitive bid, because a new contractor would have to redevelop the model that has been created by the existing vendor. 3) The existing Purchase Order was awarded from a competitive bid, but only allowed for performance through December 31, 2008; 4) NMFS has made a significant investment in the creation of the initial population model and the cost to change contractors at this point would be far more costly to the Government then extending the current performance period for an additional 12 months and could result in a loss of data.
<p>The Government plans to negotiate with Tali Vardi for the continued development of a population model for threatened Elkhorn coral. Inquiries regarding this requirement should be directed to Carey Marlow at (816) 274-6923 or submitted via email to carey.m.marlow@noaa.gov . The applicable NAICS code is 541710.</p>

<DESC>The Regional Contracting Officer, Northeast, Marine Corps Base, Quantico, Virginia intends to award a sole source contract to Batwin and Robin Productions, Inc. 151 W. 19th Street, FL 10, New York, New York 10011-4116, for professional exhibit fabrication and installation within the Marine Corps Museum.  This contract is a continuation and closeout of pre-existing contract to create, produce, and install audiovisual media within complex exhibits and synchronized with theatrical lighting within the National Museum of the Marine Corps (NMMC).   This contract picks up where the previous contract concluded and continues the work, effectively completing the original intent.  Mission failure is highly likely if the Government were to contract with another media production firm, the delays would jeopardize the overall project and would cause substantial duplication of cost to the Government.

The period of performance will be for the base year and three (3) option years from the date of award.  This notice is not a request for proposals.  No solicitation document is available for competitive bidding, however, interested parties may submit a written Statement of Capability for satisfying this requirement to the email address identified below NO LATER THAN 10:00 AM 15 July 2008.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p>The 96th Contracting Squadron, Eglin AFB, FL, intends to solicit and award a sole source Firm-Fixed-Price contract for a multi-element water content sensor system to Science Egineering Associates, Inc under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Anticipated award date is 17 July 2008. The North American Industry Classification System for this acquisition is 334519, small business size standard: 500 employees. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals/quotes. However, the government will consider all responses received within 5 days of publication. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Questions shall be submitted electronically to rodney.lewis@eglin.af.mil. An alternate contact is mary.gardner@eglin.af.mil.
<p>1. The instrument shall be able to determine Liquid Water Content (LWC, liquid water droplets only) in all FAR Part 25 Appendix C icing conditions for speeds up to 260 knots and temperatures down to -25 deg F. Additionally, the instrument shall be able to determine Total Water Content (TWC, liquid water droplets plus ice crystals), LWC, and Ice Water Content (1WC, ice crystal fraction) in mixed phase or glaciated clouds up to 12 grams per cubic meter of air at 260 knots true airspeed and temperatures down to -25 deg F.<br />2. The instrument shall consist (as a minimum) of an in-situ sense head, a processor, and associated cabling.<br />3. Sense head shall be located minimum of 150 feet from the processor.<br />4. Sense head shall be anti-iced to remain ice free in all icing conditions listed above.<br />5. If a signal conditioning junction box is required to be closer than 150 feet from the sense head, it shall be no closer than ten feet.<br />6. All wiring between the processor and sense head shall be bundled into a single common sheath cable. If a signal conditioning box is required between the processor and sense head, then a single sheath cable between processor and signal conditioning box AND a single sheath cable between signal conditioning box and sense head is acceptable.<br />7. Sense head shall have a flanged base which may be mounted flush onto existing structures.<br />8. Sense head shall be configured so that the sense elements are no closer than 7 inches from the mounting surface. If the sense head normally locates the sense elements closer than this value, a custom anti-iced, aerodynamically shaped extension may be used, provided that it satisfies all other sense head performance requirements listed in this specification.<br />9. All healing elements (cartridge, strip, or film types) for anti-icing of the sense head and custom strut (if required) shall be mounted internally and not directly exposed to the icing environment.<br /><br />10. The instrument shall have automatic seiKacJcmentjind anti-ice/deice heat control such that neither the sense head nor its eiemcHU wo'ulfi'/rjeftafrgged if sense head heating is ON and airspeed decreases to zero velocity. Sense head shall be able to survive this condition (heat ON, zero airspeed), without damage, continuously.<br />11. Sense head (excluding sense elements) shall be able to survive multiple impacts of glaze ice formations (approximately spherical) which are one half inch in diameter moving at 260 knots on the forward facing surfaces and remain operational.<br />12. The instrument shall either a) have automatic zeroing capability (to force the readings to zero when wind only is present), or b) have the ability for the user to manually zero the readings when wind only is present. Such a manual zeroing process shall be quickly and easily achieved, accomplished with either a manual pushbutton or computer entry, but NOT by manually adjusting potentiometers.<br />13. The instrument shall be able to operate with 1 lOvac, 60hz power. If the instrument is configured to operate with any other power, it shall be provided with necessary power supplies and/or transformers.<br />14. The sense head and cabling shall be constructed of materials which can withstand all cold, wet icing environments listed in this specification without shorting electrically or suffering rusting or corrosion. Additionally, if a junction box between the sense head and processor is required, it shall be similarly protected, but is not required to withstand the high velocity.<br />15. If the sense head uses any carbon steel or aluminum exposed to the environment, those components shall be either painted or anodized to prevent rusting or corrosion.<br />16. The instrument shall compensate it's readings to account for heat generated when anti-icc/dcice heating is applied (including wind velocity down to 10 knots).<br />17. Sense head, and any associated mounting hardware for the sense head, shall be aerodynamically shaped to minimize airflow distortion around the sense head and to minimize turbulence induced into the airflow.<br />18. The processor shall be configured to provide output signals which can be used as inputs to another computer where the TWC, IWC, and LWC values may be calculated and displayed.<br />19. The processor hardware shall be configured to provide a local display of the TWC, IWC, and LWC values.<br />20. The instrument shall have liquid sense elements which exhibit less than 1% false response to ice crystals OR shall have the ability to compensate for higher false response values. If such compensation algorithms are used, the calculations (or empirical test data) shall be documented in a written report and provided with the solicitation bid.</p>

At any time during or after design phase services, the Contracting Officer may request that CMc provide a firm-fixed-price proposal for the Construction Phase Work.  The Contracting Officer shall have the right to convert the Contract to a firm-fixed-price contract at the offered price or as otherwise negotiated by the parties to this Contract, so long as such price is less than or equal to the GMP.  If the parties to this Contract negotiate and establish a firm-fixed-price prior to the exercise of the Construction Phase Work Option, then the Contracting Officer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to exercise the firm-fixed-price option within 120 calendar days of the establishment of that price.<br /> <br />Design Phase Services include, and are not limited to, preliminary evaluation of the Architect of Record design development documents; review and evaluation of the Architect of Record construction document submissions for constructability; review and evaluation of all Architect of Record cost estimates; reconciliation of all cost estimates; participation in all construction document team meetings; value engineering suggestions; identification of any problems or errors in the design and design documents; consultation during design document production; preliminary project schedule development; identification of long-lead items, independent pricing of design document phase and construction document phase submittals; preliminary cost estimates; development of subcontractor and supplier interest; and, establishment of firm-fixed pricing.  The CMc shall possess a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.  The CMc must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly development and construction of the proposed project.  Most importantly, the CMc shall have complete responsibility for the construction of the facility, should the Option for Construction Phase Services be awarded.</p>
<p>Construction Phase Work includes, and are not limited to, construction of the building; project scope management; selection and procurement of all necessary subcontractors; administration of the construction contract (how much work is performed with the CMc's own forces or under subcontract); administration of the construction contract and all subcontracts; coordination of regular construction meetings; critical path method (CPM) scheduling and schedule control; maintaining construction records including daily logs and monthly reports; monitoring construction costs; progress reporting; conducting and coordinating inspections and testing to ensure proper functioning of the building; participation of Alternative Dispute Resolution partnering consultant; coordination of commissioning and turnover to designated facility management staff and tenants; performing closeout procedures; and, all other required services necessary for a complete and sustainable building.</p>
<p>The CMc is a member of the project team during the design and construction phases, along with GSA as the public owner; GSA's Construction Manager as-agent; GSA's selected architecture and engineering firm and Architect of Record; GSA's building commissioning firm; GSA's security consultant, and other consultants.  The CMc shall be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of, and not limited to, architectural, civil, structural, mechanical and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines as needed to perform the services described herein.</p>
<p>A best value concept will be applied for evaluation of offers and selection of the successful Offeror for this procurement.  The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an Offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked.  GSA will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being weighed more heavily than price.  This is an advisory procurement that consists of two stages.  In Stage 1, Pre-Solicitation Notice, Offerors will present their bonding certification and qualifications by submitting information on their related experience providing design phase services and construction phase work.  Those selected on the Stage 1 shortlist (no more than five (5) Offerors) will be invited to participate in Stage 2, Request for Proposal, of the procurement and will be asked to provide technical proposals and price.  The Stage 2 proposals will be scored according to the technical evaluation factors.  The technical proposals will be reviewed and evaluated prior to and separately from the review of the price proposals.  GSA intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the Offeror's proposal(s) in Phase(s) 1 and 2 should contain the Offeror's best terms. GSA reserves the right to conduct discussions and perform interviews if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.</p>
<p>Proposals will be evaluated using an Advisory Multi-step Process as specified in FAR 15.202.  Firms responding to the Stage 1 Pre-Solicitation Notice must submit information regarding the Offeror's experience.  Submissions shall clearly address the rating factors identified in the announcement.  A Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) will evaluate the submissions to identify Offerors with the potential to be viable competitors.  The Contracting Officer shall advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion.  No more than five Offerors will be permitted to proceed with Stage 2.  GSA shall inform all Offerors that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the SSEB in response to their submissions concerning their viability, they may participate in the resultant acquisition.</p>
<p>The following criteria represent the factors that will be used by GSA's Source Selection Evaluation Board in evaluating whether an Offeror is a viable competitor for this procurement.  This determination of viability is done based on Offeror's responses to the Stage 1 Pre-Solicitation Notice.</p>
<p>Interested Offerors are required to submit bonding certification of their ability to perform at the guaranteed maximum price of $47,800,000, and are required to be licensed general contractors.  Licensed general contractors having the minimum bonding capacity are invited to respond to this Stage 1 Pre-Solicitation Notice by submitting one (1) original and six (6) copies of the required technical information.  The submission should be in an 8-1/2" x 11" bound format and should be organized to correspond with the evaluation factors listed below.  Standard Form 330 may be utilized, but is not required.  The total pre-solicitation notice submission should not exceed 20 one-sided  8-1/2"x 11" pages or 10 double-sided 8-1/2"x 11" pages (not including Table of Contents or Section Separators), with one-inch margins, and in a font not less than 12-point in size.  Font style is optional.  All proposals must be current, reflecting a date not more than one year prior to the month of this notice.</p>
<p>Description:  These factors consider the experience of the Offeror in successfully completing similar projects.  "Similar" is defined as new construction of multi-story (2-story minimum) buildings of a minimum of 100,000, gross square feet.  These structures can include courthouses, hospital facilities, casinos, Class A office space, research laboratories, government-owned buildings, or major renovations of such similar projects, with a construction cost of a minimum of $25 million.  The SSEB will be limited to reviewing only projects of similarity for purposes of experience.</p>
<p>Factor 1 Experience in providing design phase services on similar projects.  a) Demonstrate experience on at least one (1) project(s) completed within the past eight (8) years in excess of $25 million in construction cost and a minimum of 100,000, gross square feet, in which the Offeror provided design phase services similar to those required under this project.  Include type of project delivery method, and the type of fee structure on the project(s).  Provide names, mail addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers of two members of the owner's project team for each of the projects presented.  References will be contacted.  b)  Briefly describe the successful delivery of the completed project(s) presented in Factor 1(a) within the established schedule and budget.  Relate those in type and scope to this project.  Sub-factor b) is worth twice as much as subfactor a) under Factor 1.</p>
<p>Factor 2 Experience in providing construction phase work as a prime contractor on similar projects.  a) Demonstrate experience on at least three (3) projects completed within the past eight (8) years in excess of $25 million in construction cost and a minimum of 100,000 gross square feet, in which the Offeror provided construction phase work similar to those required under this project.  Include type of project delivery method, and the type of fee structure on the project(s).  Provide names, mail addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone number of two members of the owner's project team for each of these projects.  References will be contacted.  b) Briefly describe the successful delivery of the completed projects presented in Factor 2(a).  Relate those in type and scope to this project.  Provide the construction contract award amounts and describe how the budgets were maintained.  Describe the nature of any changes that altered the construction contract award amounts.  Describe how the schedules were maintained.  If there were schedule deviations, describe how the baseline schedules differed from the actual schedules.  Demonstrate your successes in creating and maintaining non-adversarial relationships.  Demonstrate your successes in creating and maintaining subcontracting goals.  Sub-factor b) is worth twice as much as sub-factor a) under Factor 2.  Factor 2 is worth twice as much as Factor 1 in Stage 1 Pre-solicitation Notice.</p>
<p>The Stage 1 Pre-Solicitation Notice factors are independent of the factors in the Stage 2 Request for Proposal and will be used to evaluate an Offeror's viability based on its submissions to the Stage 1 Pre-Solicitation Notice.  <br /> <br />Stage 2 proposals will be evaluated according to technical evaluation factors and price.  The technical proposals in Stage 2 will be reviewed prior to the SSEB's review of price proposals.  As part of the Stage 2 evaluation, the Contracting Officer and SSEB may conduct interviews.  Final selection will be made based on technical factors being weighted significantly more than price.  No more than five (5) Offerors will be selected to submit in Stage 2.  The Offerors must use projects submitted in Stage 1 to respond to Stage 2 evaluation factors.  Offerors will be advised of technical deficiencies and significant weaknesses noted by the technical advisors and the SSEB, prior to review of the price proposals, and given an opportunity to correct the deficiencies, if the SSEB deems this to be in the interest of GSA.  Firms may be interviewed at GSA's Region 4 offices in Atlanta, Georgia, by members of the SSEB, and final selection will be made based on the technical evaluations and on price (represented by the Offeror's proposal for Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Services.)  The following criteria represent the factors that will be used by GSA's Source Selection Evaluation Board in evaluating Stage 2 proposals.  The factors in Stage 2 are equally weighted.  Factor 1 considers past performance in providing design phase services on similar projects.  Factor 2 considers past performance in providing construction phase services as a prime contractor on similar projects.  Factor 3 considers qualifications and experience of key personnel.  Factor 4 considers the management plan.  And Factor 5 considers the proposed approach for successful and meaningful participation and performance during the design phase.  Stage 2 also requires Offerors to present the resources and facilities available to the CMc to accomplish this project, and to indicate their intention to submit a subcontracting plan for this project that provides for participation by small business concerns (Goal 39%), hubzone small business concerns (Goal 3%), small disadvantaged business concerns (Goal 6%), women-owned small business concerns (Goal 5%), and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns (3%).</p>
<p>Interested firms must send their submittal, no later than 2:00 PM EST on Wednesday, August 20, 2008, to Valerie Riecke Smith, Contracting Officer, General Services Administration, Acquisition Management Division (4PGA), Suite 2500, 401 West Peachtree Street N.W., Atlanta, Georgia, 30308.  A Pre-Proposal Conference and Industry Day will be held on Monday, July 28, 2008, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  The location of the Pre-Proposal Conference and Industry Day (Networking Session) will be sent by an update at least 7 calendar days prior to the date.  Industry Day allows for the exchange of information between the small business community and potential prime contractors to facilitate marketing, employment and business ventures opportunities.   Prior to award of this contract to a large business, an acceptable subcontracting plan will be required in accordance with FAR Part 19, which demonstrates a proactive effort to achieve the following minimum small business goals for all subcontracted work:  All submittals must clearly indicate the solicitation number (GS-04P-08-EX-C-0119) on the face of the envelope. Late submittals will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).   Facsimile proposals will not be accepted.  Be advised that, due to heightened security measures, individuals entering a Federal facility must have photo identification and may be delayed.  Firms planning to hand-deliver submissions should take this into consideration.</p>

This unrestricted procurement is being issued in accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 12, FAR Part 15 and FAR Subpart 16.5. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) will award a single Firm-Fixed-Price Indefinite Delivery Requirements type contract with a period of performance of 48 months.

(b) Offerors proposals should describe in detail all the technical features of the proposed product in accordance with the specifications and PWS. Offerors proposals should include product literature as part of their proposals. (c) Offerors should provide information to support their demonstrated capability to produce and deliver the initial quantity of 10 hand-held readers no more than 90 days (“Threshold”) from the date of the issued delivery order.

As stated earlier, the initial delivery order will be issued concurrently with the Requirements Contract.

Items followed by the word "Threshold" are minimum requirements or performance that the proposed product must have. Items followed by the word "Objective" represent desirable increases in operational capabilities. These “Objective” requirements or any portion thereof, as well as any other items or increased performance capabilities the Offeror considers desirable or to add value, may be offered.

(2) PRODUCT DEMONSTRATION: All Offerors must demonstrate their proposed hand-held readers to test: (a) the ability of the item(s) offered to correctly meet the specification requirements and (b) the user-friendliness. This live 45-minute demonstration is intended to exercise the required function(s) to determine if the capability required is actually being provided. Attachment D contains the demonstration scenario that all Offerors will be required to perform. The item demonstrated must meet the expected results. All Offerors must satisfactorily demonstrate the functional operation of the item to receive further consideration under the terms of the solicitation. All Offerors will demonstrate all features of the item to include any evaluated optional features that are being offered. 

(3) QUALITY ASSURANCE AND MANAGEMENT: Offerors proposals should provide information to support their demonstrated ability to ensure production, delivery, and supportability of high quality hand-held readers and mitigate risk of occurrence of quality problems as well as to manage and support an acquisition of this size; utilize and manage subcontractors (if applicable); and effectively and efficiently interact with the Government during production and the warranty period.

(4) WARRANTY TERMS AND WARRANTY PROCESS: Offerors proposals should provide information to support their demonstrated ability to provide efficient and effective warranty support once the hand-held readers are delivered in accordance with section 5.2 of the PWS.

The Contractor must provide ONLY three past performance references (either Government or commercial customers) who have received similar equipment in the past three years, or in progress. The following CURRENT information MUST be provided: (1) Name of organization, (2) Current Point of Contact, Email Address and Phone Number, (3) Contract Number (4) Brief description of the equipment provided and (5) Contract Value. These references will be contacted. The Government reserves the right to utilize relevant past performance information other than what was submitted in the Offeror’s proposal.

When combined, Technical Capability, Product Demonstration, Quality Assurance and Management, Warranty Terms and Warranty Process, Relevant Past Performance are more important than Price.

The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer shall contain the Offeror’s best terms from a technical and price standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer. Note: The Government will not pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of proposals or other costs incurred in response to this announcement.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

HSAR 3052.209-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [Jun 2006]   
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional cost that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

 HSAR 3052.209–70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006).
 
    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that {Check one}:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established five permanent regional offices and one sub-regional office.  The regional offices are located in San Jose, Costa Rica; Bangkok, Thailand; Dakar, Senegal; Nairobi, Kenya; and Pretoria, South Africa.  The Asia sub-regional office is in Kathmandu, Nepal.
The OFDA/Asia offices cover the Asia–Pacific region, which includes twenty-six countries in South, Southeast, and East Asia and sixteen Pacific Island nations. This also includes the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which will soon receive disaster assistance from USAID, in transition from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The region of responsibility is comprised of rich and poor nations, and politically stable and failing states.  It is a region of diverse cultures, languages, topographies, and disaster vulnerabilities.

OBJECTIVE

The Asia Regional Team requires the services of a Principal Regional Advisor (PRA) for the Asia-Pacific Region, based in its Bangkok, Thailand office. This position requires an experienced practitioner in disaster response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. The incumbent is responsible for managing the Asia Regional Office and supervising its staff, development of the three-year Asia strategy, coordination of disaster response activities, and for the identification and formulation of disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs primarily in the Asia region.  

The PRA will actively develop and coordinate preparedness, mitigation and training programs to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations to respond and prepare for disasters in the affected region.  Frequent travel within Asia and the Pacific region will be required.


9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Principal Regional Advisor's responsibilities will include the following:

1) Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the Disaster Response Team Leader in OFDA/Washington (OFDA/W), the PRA will:

•	Serve as the DCHA/OFDA lead representative in Asia and the primary point of contact on OFDA -related matters in the region;

•	Manage the OFDA Asia Regional Office and supervise all office staff; 

•	Travel to the scene of a disaster or potential disaster and conduct initial assessments of damages and needs;

•	Recommend appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions in consultation with USAID/W; and provide timely reporting cables and other written analysis of all disaster, humanitarian and emergency events;

•	Coordinate and maintain close liaison with representatives of host government, donor governments, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, U.S. Embassy, and USAID missions to ensure efficient and coordinated disaster response activities;

•	Monitor OFDA-funded activities;

•	Coordinate the requests, receipt, distribution, tracking, and accounting of relief supplies provided by OFDA;

•	Facilitate and coordinate the arrival and departure of DARTs with the U.S. Mission and, as required, serve on DARTs when appropriate;

•	Maintain communications, while on travel, with the Asia Regional Office;

•	Under the guidance and supervision of the Disaster Response Team Leader, coordinate with OFDA/W and other OFDA Asia regional offices, and prepare information requirements and reports;

•	Become certified and serve as a Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) for grants, cooperative agreements and contracts under portfolio of responsibility.

2) Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation - Working closely with OFDA/W and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the PRA will assist representatives of host government organizations, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.

Specifically, the incumbent, in collaboration with OFDA/W Asia team colleagues, will: 

•	Prepare (and supervise the preparation of) regular strategic and analytical reports on current or anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries;

•	Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance for OFDA, USAID, local governments, and other donors/organizations, as appropriate;

•	Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID officials on disaster, response, mitigation and risk reduction efforts, including the review of sector disaster response and DRM and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) plans;

•	Provide support, as required, for other DRM and DRR initiatives in the assigned region as identified by the Asia Regional Office. Support may include assessment visits, project design/evaluation exercises and hazards/vulnerability/risk analysis;

•	In the area of mitigation, work with other agencies/organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting the region and countries, and develop projects/activities for addressing these;

•	Work with local and regional institutions and private/public sector organizations to incorporate mitigation into appropriate programs.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Principal Regional Advisor will work under the supervision of, and report directly to, the Disaster Response Team Leader.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
Supervisory controls will be minimal.  The Principal Regional Advisor is expected to act independently with little direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.  The Disaster Response Team Leader will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.

The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>VA National Center for PTSDDate: 06/23/2008Project: Rewrite and Edit Fact SheetsDESCRIPTION OF WORK The NCPTSD Website (www.ncptsd.va.gov) contains 135 Fact Sheets (i.e., brief overviews of information) on a variety of topics related to PTSD and traumatic stress.  Specific audience groups were created as part of a major website re-design.  In addition the Center has begun the process of repackaging fact sheets originally written for professional audiences into material appropriate for the general public. Fact sheets need to be presented in a way that will capitalize on adult learning strategies in order to increase the impact of the material on the reader.  We believe several steps are necessary to insure that fact sheets are appropriate for the general public, including veterans, other trauma survivors, and family members.1.	Fifty two (52) existing fact sheets for the general public need to be reviewed.  Content should be revised so that it is easy to understand and is engaging to our general audience.  This means that it needs to be both written at a 7th grade reading level and presented in a manner which is accessible to this audience.2.	Thirty six (36) fact sheets that currently serve as both lay and professional audience fact sheets need to be revised so that there is a specific version written for each audience group.  Again, information needs to be written at both the correct grade level and in a way that is accessible to the targeted audience.3.	Forty seven (47) fact sheets for professional audiences need to be reviewed.  Content should be revised so that it is presented in an easy to understand format that is suitable for a professional audience.4.	Finally, redundant content within audience groups needs to be identified and eliminated.  In some cases the content can be eliminated while in other cases content might be revised and included in other existing fact sheets.Fact sheets content can be supplied to the vendor in html format, or text can be pulled directly from the Website by the vendor.  A VA Education Specialist will work with the vendor to provide guidance on necessary changes and to review overall strategy for edits.   The vendor will accept up to three rounds of edits from the NCPTSD Executive Division.  Final fact sheets will be supplied by the vendor in a web-ready format as specified below. DELIVERABLES:Contractor will provide final revised educational materials in web-ready format, including at least 52 fact sheets for the general public, 36 fact sheets (that serve two audiences), need to be divided and written for each specific audience, and 47 fact sheets need to be reviewed and edited as needed for the professional audience. SKILLS NEEDEDThe contractor needs to be proficient in creating educational materials on health (and preferably mental health) for both a lay and professional audience.  This requires understanding of: how to translate research into practice, curriculum development, adult learning strategies, scientific writing, and social marketing.  Contractor must be familiar with VA/Government 508 compliance regulations so that fact sheets can be delivered in a web-ready format.Specifically, the contractor must:1)	Demonstrate an understanding of all elements involved in this project including:a.	Ability to write effectively for a variety of audiences including the Centers audiences as specified in this work requestb.	Experience in creating effective educational materials for health promotionc.	Experience in taking research findings and translating to educational formats easily absorbed and retained by learners d.	Experience working with researchers and clinicianse.	Knowledge in making materials web-ready as per Center's website specificationsf.	Familiarity with trauma and PTSD preferred2)	Have at least two years experience in this type of work.3)	Fully describe past experience in conducting the type of work specified in this solicitation.4)	Have sufficient knowledge of the National Center's extensive website and familiarity of Center's portfolio of fact sheets and other materials such that new materials are produced that are compatible with the Center's current Website.EVALUATION CRITERIAThe government will award a contract based on technical experience, past performance and cost/price.  FACTOR 1: EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL APPROACHa)	Demonstrate your understanding of the solicitation requirements and submit a proposed approach to meeting and/or exceeding contract specification and deadlines.  b)	Demonstrate that you are currently and regularly engaged in writing and editing educational content focused on health/mental health for both a lay and professional audience.c)	Edit the sample fact sheet "Nightmares" located at http://ncptsd.va.gov/ncmain/ncdocs/fact_shts/fs_nightmares.html?opm=1&rr=rr28&srt=d&echorr=true so that it is appropriate for a general audience and submit with your proposal.d)	Describe the proposed Project Team for this effort and provide a brief resume of key personnele)	Describe how you plan to accomplish this work including completion dates.FACTOR 2: PAST PERFORMANCEa)	Describe your past experience with creating and revising educational content as specified in the scope of work. FACTOR 3: COST/PRICEa)	The pricing proposal should be specific and separate from the technical proposal.  It shall contain supporting cost information in sufficient detail to indicate how the offeror arrived at the proposed prices.  Factor 1: Experience and technical approach	Mandatory items satisfied	Total Maximum Points	Rating	CommentsSub factors:  a)  Ability to write effectively for a variety of audiences				b)  Knowledge in creating  web-ready materials as per Center's website specifications				c)  Experience creating effective educational materials				d)  Sample Fact Sheet written and evaluated by VA Education Specialist				e)  Plan to accomplish work including completion dates				Factor 2: Past Performance				Sub factors:  a)  Fully describe your past experience with creating and revising educational content as specified in the scope of work.

ANSWERThe base diameter of the SRB's is 146" the stiffener ring studs go out to a diameter of154".2.QUESTIONWhen will proposed drawings need to be submitted?ANSWERDrawings are not required for the quoting process.3.QUESTIONWhat is the start date of the work?ANSWERAward of contract is expected mid August4.QUESTIONWhat is the maximum number of people expected to be on the machine at a given time?ANSWERThe maximum number of people will be 85.QUESTIONVerify that the wall-tie support beams, (REF # 90M12311) located at the north elevationof the test stand will be able to withstand the following loads:	    3,000lb compression/tension	    1,000lb shearANSWERThese loads are acceptable and NASA can accommodate this design.6.QUESTIONProvide the minimum and maximum working radii of the test subject.ANSWERMin. 73", Max 77"7.QUESTIONProvide project start date.ANSWERMid August8.QUESTIONWhat is the delivery date of the Mast ClimbersANSWERProject delivery date is December 20089.QUESTIONMast climbers shall be driven by electric motors (are there any non-standard criteria forthe electrical components)ANSWERNo10.QUESTIONMast climbers shall have a synchronizing/leveling mechanism between the two motors in thetwo tower configuration (Should this be manual or automatic)ANSWERBoth11.QUESTIONMast climbers shall have a visible and audible alarm while in motion (are there anynon-standard criteria for the electrical components)ANSWERNo12.QUESTIONMastclimbers shall be automatically stopped if platforms become uneven during operationin the two tower configuration (There is the option to have an electrically operated,automatic self-leveling system fitted to ensure that the two units remain level at alltimes, this also includes a back-up fail-safe for the failure of the leveling systemand would manually allow the leveling of the units, is this preferable?)ANSWERThis system is acceptable as long as the requirement for automatic stop is met.13.QUESTIONMast climbers shall have safety controls for the upper and lower limit of travel(mechanical?, electrical? both?)ANSWERBoth14.QUESTIONMast climbers shall have the functionality of being used in a single tower configuration(What load and configuration would be required for each single unit?)ANSWERThe configuration would be where the mast is toward the work area.  The load capacityshould be standard manufactures recommendations.15.QUESTIONMast climbers shall be able to use the main platform straight extensions from the twotower configuration in a single tower configuration (Please clarify by indicating desiredconfiguration and load characteristics)ANSWERWe want to be able to use the straight outer extensions that are used in the two towerconfiguration to attach to the sides of the platform in the one tower configuration. These extensions would go straight out on each side of the platform.16.QUESTIONMast climbers shall be anchored to the concrete floor with vendor supplied hardware(There a number of options here, e.g. bolt through slab, face mount, slab mount, steelbolts, stainless steel bolts. Also what is the strength of the concrete, is therereinforcement, post tensioning etc)ANSWERThe concrete is about 43 years old.  It is 3000 psi. Concrete will be resurfaced and selfleveling grout poured on top of it at a thickness of 1.5" or may grout plate in where theHydro Dynamic Stands (HDS's) can be moved around on air pallets. If NASA decides to dothe later, the mast climbers will go directly into the concrete. The concrete inside thebuilding varies from 6' to 8'.17.QUESTIONVendor shall provide training manuals for operation and assembly of mast climbers. Vendorshall also provide training for operation of mast climbers. (The governing body of thepowered access industry (IPAF) has an international training course for users andinstallers, and issues Powered Access Licenses upon completion (similar to a driverslicense), is the training referred to for only users, or is there a requirement forInstaller Training.)ANSWERYes, there is a requirement for installer training. NASA plans on using these mastclimbers in several areas of building 4550 and there may be future use for them in otherplaces on the center.18.QUESTIONMast climbers shall be designed to a safety factor of 4 to 1 at a maximum load condition(Including tensile and shear negation on the anchor bolts?)ANSWERIf this is not covered in the ANSI/SIA standard, it remains a Government requirement.19.QUESTIONMast climber shall have a minimum load capacity of 5000 lbs evenly distributed overplatforms in the two tower configuration, and at maximum span length in the one towerconfiguration. (Is there a maximum point load requirement.)ANSWERMax point load is 300 pounds.  20.QUESTIONRemovable decking shall be level with secondary decking and main platform decking (Pleaseadvise if there would be a desire for the secondary decking to be electrically extendedor retracted. This is possible, and, depends on the answers to previous questions)ANSWERThis solution is acceptable but is not a requirement.21.QUESTIONAll safety fences shall comply with 29 CFR 1910.23 (e) (Is the mast climber system evergoing to be in use when no rocket body is present? If so, front handrails would berequired, similarly, if the mast climbers were to be used in a situation where the frontedge was more than 14 from a solid surface, i.e. rocket body, front handrails would berequired)ANSWERActually here at Marshall that distance is 12".  We plan to install a life line system ifthis is ever the case.22.QUESTIONMast climbers shall have hard stops at the top and bottom of travel, in case of limitswitch failure (Does this mean mechanical stops)ANSWERYes23.QUESTIONHow do the dimensions of the rocket change and at what elevation?ANSWERThe only change in diameter of the first stage the aft skirt it goes from 215" at thebottom to around 152" at the top.  The SRB stacks are around 146".  The aft skirt isapprox. 91" tall.  During test the bottom the aft skirt will be about 14 feet above thefloor.24.QUESTIONWhere/how do you want to access the platform?ANSWERThere should be gate locations shown on the drawings.  These will need to be there so wecan access the platforms from the catwalks inside the building. at the higher levels. Ifyou would like to add additional to the platforms that would be fine.25.QUESTIONWe were told that we would anchor in to the floor, if we are then will we have drawingsof the concrete floor?ANSWERDrawing attached to the modification26.QUESTIONDoes the requirement call for the mast climber to work on the opposite side of the mast?.ANSWERNo,  what we are asking is to be able to turn the mast around and use the climber in theconventional manner.  The platforms would have to be disassembled from the configurationshown in the drawings.NASA QUESTION TO ALL VENDORS: How much of an impact would it be to have the mast tied atevery 48' instead of every 24'? Please submit this information with your offer.The due date for receipt of offers is extended to 7/18/2008.

<DESC>This amendment extends the response date for the RFI from 8 July 2008 to 18 July 2008, 3:00PM EST.  Any comments, questions and recommendations, in regard to the draft solicitation/RFP and associated attachments are requested to be submitted by this date.  All questions and answers will be made available on the the NAVAIR website at http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations under draft solicitation number N00019-08-P5-AZ038. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information.          

This Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit industry comments on the Direct Attack Moving Target Capability (DAMTC) draft solicitation and attachments identified herein.  A competitive solicitation for DAMTC is anticipated for release in or around the 4th quarter of FY08.  A Best Value source selection is planned based on a performance-based specification.  Interested parties should check this web site periodically for updated information.   

This RFI will make a draft DAMTC solicitation and draft technical documents available via request from current and approved Department of Defense (DoD) contractors, and requests written feedback from Industry related to the upcoming acquisition.   NAVAIR intends to use the information provided in response to this RFI to aid in refining its acquisition strategy and solicitation. The Naval Air Systems Command, Precision Strike Weapons Program Office (PMA201) intends to procure on a competitive basis a non-developmental capability that will effectively engage moving targets in any operational environment, day or night and in adverse weather.   In addition to the ability to hit moving targets, the Direct Attack Moving Target Capability (DAMTC) will provide tactical flexibility to the war fighter for use on the USN F/A-18A+C/D/E/F and AV-8B aircraft.  The capability will be incorporated via retrofit utilizing existing direct attack inventories (GBU-12 Laser Guided Bomb (LGB) and GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM)).  

The Government is requesting written comments and recommendations on the draft solicitation/RFP and all attachments. While the contractor’s will be notified within Section L of all conditions for award, the Government welcomes any comments or recommendation in regard to the acquisition approach.  The Government is considering awarding of up to 2 contracts from this single solicitation for the base period  An award split for the full-rate production options is anticipated to be 50/50.  Final source selection criteria is in development and will be defined in Section L and M of the final solicitation. 

It is also noted that the Capabilities Production Document (CPD) is currently in draft format.  The CPD has not been approved at the release of the draft solicitation and is subject to change.  Any award from the final solicitation will be contingent upon the Navy approval of the CPD and Milestone C decision.

A draft solicitation/RFP will be posted to the NAVAIR homepage. The NAVAIR homepage is located at http://www.navair.navy.mil.  The draft solicitation number is N00019-08-P5-AZ038.  To find the draft solicitation/RFP you must select ‘Doing Business with Us’ and then ‘Open Solicitations’ or call the help desk at (301) 342-4686 if you  are in need of further assistance.  The draft solicitation/RFP will be released and posted to the website on or about 24 June 2008.   Except as noted here, the Government will only release the draft solicitation/RFP, including any subsequent amendments and updates, over the Internet.  

Any amendments or updates will be posted on the same NAVAIR web page.  After the draft solicitation release, vendors should regularly access the website to ensure they have all amendments.  Failure to obtain any posted amendments and to respond to each of them prior to the date and time set for receipt of offers may render your offer non-responsive. 

RELEASE OF TECHNICAL DATA:  The DAMTC draft solicitation, performance specification, and statement of objectives are still under development and available for your review and comment. This program includes information that is marked  “Distribution D” and is only releasable to current and approved Department of Defense (DoD) contractors.  In addition, the program requires a procurement effort in certain critical technologies/data that are not releasable to foreign firms.  Some documents are under Federal export control for “sensitive” or “controlled” technologies regulated by the U.S. Department of State’s International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) protecting national security.  Data may not be exported without an approval, authorization, or license under E.O. 12470 or the Arms Export Control Act.

To request a copy, please email Karen Shelley at Karen.Shelley@wpafb.af.mil.




Addition Information (29 Jun 07):The attached questions and answers were taken from Panel Discussions at T-38C IBSP Industry Days on 12 Jun 07.




Addition Information:The attached performance specifications were developed during a two year risk reduction activity.  These performance specifications define key envelope information, desired system performance and testing requirements. The attached specifications are provided as a baseline reference to aid in the development and qualification of your proposed design.  In the interest of best value, potential offerors are encouraged to review and propose any improvements and/or modifications to the performance specifications.




1.  The intent of this Request For Information (RFI) is to develop a betterunderstanding of technologies available and resources required to incorporate animproved braking system on the T-38C aircraft.  The overall requirement for theT-38 Improved Brake System Program (IBSP) is to upgrade USAF Air Education TrainingCommand's fleet of 453 T-38C and 3 AFMC T-38C aircraft.  Although not finalized, itis possible that this requirement will be expanded to include both the US Navy TestPilot Schools 10 T-38C aircraft and the 31 T-38N aircraft operated by NASA.



The upgraded system shall include the addition of anti-skid capability; replacementof the current wheel, brake, master cylinders, and other system components (as necessary); appropriate updates to all aircraft training devices and technical manuals; necessary on and off aircraft test equipment, any required studies andanalyses and all associated integration issues; and interim contractor supportuntil fielding is complete.  The IBSP is intended to improve performance,reliability, maintainability and aircraft safety.  More specifically, themodification shall:



- Increase braking performance enabling a 13,500 pound aircraft to accelerate totake off speed with 60% flaps and subsequently stop safely on the remaining space of an 8000 foot runway (45 degrees C, 1500' pressure altitude)


- Prevent wheel skid, and or lockup; keep wheel speed below tread adhesion limit;provide protection from hydroplaning.


- Prevent wheel brakes from being applied until wheels are up to speed


- Provide fault detection and cockpit annunciation


- Shall not add main landing gear vibrations during takeoff, landing or ground operations.



- Shall not cause loss of all braking if brake control fails.


- Extend brake service life to at least 450 flight hours (current service life isless than 200)


- Not reduce current Mission Capable rates of aircraft


- Not increase Maintenance Man Hours (MMH) per flying hour more than 1%


- Not increase tire change time over 5 additional minutes



2. The IBSP acquisition approach is anticipated to be a competitive solicitationwith the intent of utilizing a non-development approach to the greatest extentpossible.  The selected contractor will assume all responsibility for development,testing and integration of the proposed system. The anticipated acquisition mayinclude up to two years of development and a six-year ordering period with variablequantity bands and a most probable quantity".  The Government currentlyanticipates a production and installation rate of six (6) to seven (7) shipsets permonth (72 - 84 per year). The quantity bands will need to be structured withsuitable flexibility to accelerate or decelerate the rate of production toaccommodate fluctuations in funding.  It is anticipated that IBSP modification kitswill be installed by contractor field teams.


3.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does notconstitute a solicitation.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Inaccordance with FAR 15.202(e), a response to this notice is not an offer and cannotbe accepted by the government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.


4. Contractors interested in responding to the request shall provide answers to the attached questions in the order indicated below and provide any additionalinformation to this office by COB 9 Feb 07. Please send correspondence toAttn: Capt Brandon Ledbetter, Program Manager (937) 904-4162 e-mailbrandon.ledbetter@wpafb.af.mil or Mr. George Sarmiento, Program Manager(937) 904-4307, george.sarmiento@wpafb.af.mil   Please limit your response to nomore than 10 single-sided 8  x 11 pages, double-spaced, minimum 12 point fontsize.

PURPOSE
The 827th Aircraft Sustainment Group (ACSG) Contracting Office, Tinker AFB OK, is conducting market research to determine estimated cost, schedule, and performance parameters required to procure a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) VOR antenna, manufacture the structural support within the tail.

DESCRIPTION
The current C/KC-135 VOR antenna is becoming unsupportable.  EDO Corporation manufactures the desired replacement antenna.  Additional structural support is needed in the vertical tail for the installation of this VOR antenna.  451 structural kits will be fabricated and 418 installations will occur.  The government would like responses from industry regarding the cost and schedule to procure the antenna and associated parts, and to manufacture the structural kit.

The government intends to procure 459 VOR antenna kits.  The contractor would be required to provide two antennas (P/N DM N4-17-1/N, NSN 5985-01-371-3432), two gaskets (P/N AG867000-02, NSN N/A) one coupler (P/N DM N4-17-2, NSN 5985-01-169-6740), and two cable assembly units (P/N DMU212-1, NSN 5995-01-378-2787) for each antenna kit.  These parts have been tested and proven to be compatible with C/KC-135 electronics.  Similar antenna components with the same functional capabilities can be recommended instead of the previous parts mentioned.  EMI testing will be required as well as other tests if determined applicable.

1.   16 June 2008
Question:  Under the description it states c/kc-135 VOR antenna is becoming unsupportable?  Please clarify that statement.  Also, is this just for a quote or a real requirement?
Answer:  The current antenna is out of date and therefore it is being impossible to keep them in working order so we are looking to replace them altogether.  The notice you are looking at is only a Request for Information (RFI) is not a request for quote.  We are simply looking for information before we do a request for quote.

3.  19 June 2008
Question:  Where are drawings for Radius Blocks TS888G250B0556B & TS888G275B0350B that are part of this component?  What is the specified material if different from the basic -12066?  Are there drawings available for the Radius Blocks TS888G250B0556B & TS888G275B0350B (ref drawing 14060-12065)? 
Answer:  These are a radius block made by a L-3com standard.  TS888G250B0556B is a Radius block with a thickness of .250 inch, a width of 2.5 inches (dimension X), with one radius of the thickness (.250), a height of 5.56 inches (dimension Y), and a finish of epoxy primer. Material to be made of 7075T651b per specification QQ-A-250/12.  TS888G275B0350B is a Radius block with a thickness of .250 inch, a width of 2.75 (dimension X), with one radius of the thickness (.250), a height of 3.5 inches (dimension Y) and a finish of epoxy primer.  Material to be made of 7075T651b per specification QQ-A-250/12.  Tolerance for Dimension X is +- .01 and Y +/- .03.
4.  19 June 2008
Question:   14060-12064 Rev-B
a. As these mirror image parts appear to be castings – will the molds or mold DWGs be provided, or will these parts be quoted separately
b. Raw material is specified as 7050T7451 to AMS-4050
i. Is it rational to consider machining out of block material as an alternative for small quantities?
ii. If so what are alt permissible alloys?
Answer:   These parts are machined out, not made from castings. The No permissible alloys for this project were identified. The possibility of rust or corrosion is significantly increased if a substitute alloy is used.   In the prototype, these adapters were made to have the antenna’s parallel to one another.  It is recommended to use a 5 axis milling machine.  The ones installed were manufactured on a 4 axis milling machine; however the company performing the prototype is experienced in building parts in this manner.
5.  19 June 2008
	Question:   14060-12063 Rev-A
a. This material is specified as 7075T6 CLAD, clad with what and how thick?
Answer:   7075T6 is the aluminum to be used. Standard industry CLAD procedures are  acceptable with regards to thickness and application.
6.  19 June 2008
Question:   14060-12062 Rev-B
a. Will vendor be provided the following tools, (or tool drawings, or vendor to manufacture?)
i. For the -1 & -5 parts Tool S/N 736086 (Vendor P/N 8620-07-D-30400011)  Note 7
ii. For the -3 & -6 parts Tool S/N 736102 (Vendor P/N 8620-07--30400011)   Note 8

Answer:   These tools are in a government warehouse and will be provided as Government Furnished Property.

<DESC><p>The 565 CBSS / GBLB located at Warner Robins Air Logistics Center (WR-ALC) is issuing the attached "draft" Performance Based Work Statement (PBWS) to obtain industry input toward the acquisition and sustainment of the Versatile Depot Automated Test Station (VDATS). It is the intent of the Government to award a five to ten year Performance Based Acquisition (PBA) contract for this effort.
<p>There is potential that this effort may be set aside for small business. However, significant on-going market research by the Government will be the deciding factor.</p>
<p>The VDATS was developed organically by the Air Force to support multiple weapon systems. This tester is designed to eventually replace most of the legacy testers currently in use by the Air Force depots.</p>
<p>In order to expand our market research, an Industry Day will be hosted at Robins AFB, GA, in the Air Force Museum, beginning July 29, 2008 and ending July 30, 2008. During this time, interested sources will have the opportunity to pose questions and provide input into the requirement development. In addition, the Government will use this Industry Day as a means of gauging the availability of qualified commercial sources. Since our organic maintenance capability will largely depend on the availability of the VDATS, the Government intends to utilize a rigorous source selection process to ensure award is ultimately made to the source that offers the best value to the Government. Of utmost importance is demonstrated experience to: 1) build similar automatic test equipment (ATE) to include acquiring parts, assembly and testing; 2) support similar ATE through the management of multiple suppliers, supply chain integration, and in-house technical capability.</p>
<p>Industry representatives should be prepared to discuss execution risks associated with the PBWS, and any appropriate best commercial practices that could be incorporated into the strategy. The Government will also lead a discussion on risks and the general source selection criteria anticipated. To finalize the Industry Day dialogue and collection of ideas, scheduled times will be allotted for one-on-one discussions as requested by each contractor in attendance.</p>
<p>All reservations for this event must be made starting July 9, 2008 and no later than July 14, 2008. Please contact the Industry POC at Linda.Ralston@robins.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>Dear Vendor:

With the evolving mission needs of the war fighter, DSCC aims to improve support and readiness through an Industrial Product-Support Vendor (IPV) program.  Therefore, the Department of Defense will release two solicitations for a type of a supply chain management process that will provide innovative and responsive logistics support to meet military needs for the following Army maintenance sites:  Letterkenny Army Depot (LEAD) and Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD).  The IPV solicitations will capitalize on the strengths of the supply chain integrator and the Government's ability to improve the supply chain process while increasing both support availability and parts reliability.

This initiative will require vendors to provide items classified as "benchstock - hardware" for the military depot or maintenance facility listed above.  IPV will improve DLA logistics reponse time and increase mission readiness at a cost comparable to traditional support methods.  The term of the contract will consist of a base period of four years with wo, two-year option periods for a total of eight years.

To provide the business community an opportunity to ask questions about the solicitations and the IPV program, the Defense Supply Center Columbus (DSCC), located in Columbus, Ohio, will host a pre-proposal conference on 16 July 2008.

More importantly, the conference will provide small business the opportunity to netowrk; likewise, the companies will have an opportunity to learn how they can qualify as sources of supply for IPV.  The TYAD solicitaiton will have increased subcontracting opportunties with IPV vendor who will be required to achieve challenging subcontrqacting goals and partnering agreements for an unrestricted solicitation.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

Part I: Background information and description of requirements:

The Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology (LTIB) is a large translational research program with goal design, development and delivery of innovative immunotherapies for various types of human cancers. Many projects involve monitoring patient immune responses pre and post-vaccination in the vaccine clinical trials. An ELISPOT assay for interferon gamma and other cytokines production to evaluate T-cell responses was used using peptides from tumor associated antigens such as CEA, PSA, MUC-1. These assays are also used in the pre-clinical study for many investigators in LTIB. An ImmunoSpot (ELISPOT) Reader is required for the measurement of the number, the size, and the intensity of the cytokine producing specific T cells. The current ELISPOT Reader in LTIB is a first generation ELISPOT Reader. This ELISPOT Reader has limited functions and applications. In addition, the current ELISPOT reader gives diffused images and extra effort is required to distinguish the different between dirt from small spots in some samples. An advance model ELISPOT Reader is essential for the precise determination of patient immune responses pre vs. post vaccination.

<DESC>This notice serves as a modification to presolicitation notice posted under Reference-Number-20035-08 on 3 April 2008.  Presolicitation notice is herby modified to read as follows: The Naval Air Systems Command intends to award a delivery order to the AN/ALQ-214 IDECM BOA with ITT Avionics, Clifton, New Jersey, for risk reduction of the AN/ALQ-214 Engineering Change Proposal (ECP).  The scope of this effort includes supplies and services required from the Contractor for risk reduction efforts in support of an AN/ALQ-214 ECP. The ALQ-214 ECP is intended to allow the ALQ-214 to meet the requirement for the On-Board Jammer (OBJ) to function on F/A-18 C/D/E/F.  This ALQ-214 ECP support shall include development of Preliminary functional block diagrams at the OBJ system and sub-system level (e.g., Receiver, Technique Generator (TG), resource management functions) and also development of preliminary system level specification requirements and SRA level specifications.  This support shall also include preliminary design of the WRAs/SRAs to include the digital and RF SRAs and the common shock/hard-mounted rack assembly, and software requirements.  The Contractor shall conduct two Technical Interchange Meetings (TIMs) and one System Level Requirements Review to review the technical status of preliminary specifications and associated ECP design changes.  The Contractor shall report on each effort, and may be required to prepare and submit “Engineering White Papers” for discussing tradeoffs associated with hardware or software changes.  A September 2008 award is anticipated for these efforts. This effort is being awarded on a sole source basis, as ITT Avionics is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the AN/ALQ-214(V)3 subsystem and is the only firm that can provide these services within the required time frames and cost limitations.  This synopsis is published for informational purposes only.  Expressions of interest in subcontracting shall be addressed to Mr. Dan Sullivan of ITT Avionics at (973) 284-3519.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Aircrew Endurance Program seeks interested vendors to support production of a new man mounted survival item/body armor carrier. This carrier will be a replacement for the currently fielded survival vest and body armor worn by USN and USMC operators of H-46, H-53, UH-1, H-60, V-22, and AH-1 aircraft. Competitive production contract(s) to a Navy specification will be awarded in 2010. This notice is to announce an industry day to be held 19 June 2008 so that potential suppliers may be prepared to present webbings, hardware components, harness components, and fabrics that may be incorporated into the manufacturing specification to enhance the capability of the system. The USN intends to present design and integration requirements as well as system design concepts during this Industry Day. Participation in this Industry Day is not mandatory and will not preclude any interested vendors from participation in the subsequent procurement. 

Specific hardware components sought include but are not limited to: webbing closures, pocket attachment hardware, pocket closures, garment closures, rip-cords, and friction adjusters that can be blind-operated with a wetted, gloved, hand; that will operate in the sandy conditions of the Middle East as well as wet rainy conditions; that are durable in extreme heat and cold, that have a matte finish; that have a 66 lb hardware retention strength, are snag resistant; that exhibit salt-fog corrosion resistance, high heat resistance, flame resistance; are  lightweight, low bulk, consistent multiple use, easily replaceable, and that have no parts or components that can accidentally detach or shed under rotor wash, high wind, or light impact.

Specific fabrics and tapes/ webbings sought include but are not limited to those appropriate for load-carrying  (e.g., 7-lb hard armor plate, 10-lb soft armor, 40 pounds of survival items). Such fabrics must be flame and high-heat resistant, and ideally, highly air permeable.  A fabric that can provide a slick yet durable lining for the hard armor plate to allow it to slip in and out of a durable outer pocket is also desired.   

Specific harness components sought include but are not limited to webbings, fasteners, friction adjusters, and closures that comply with ANSI Z359 for fall protection, and are flame resistant, high heat resistant.  Webbing fasteners shall meet not only all requirements of the hardware components above but in addition, be able to be quickly disconnected under tension, e.g., an aviator whose harness is snagged in an underwater emergency. 

Vendors may prepare a list of concerns and questions they may have regarding the requirements for this industry day. No written responses will be provided from the Government. Vendors are encouraged to bring product samples, test results, and evidence of Berry amendment compliance.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Aircrew Endurance Program seeks interested vendors to support production of a new man mounted survival item/body armor carrier. This carrier will be a replacement for the currently fielded survival vest and body armor worn by USN and USMC operators of H-46, H-53, UH-1, H-60, V-22, and AH-1 aircraft. Competitive production contract(s) to a Navy specification may occur in the 2010 timeframe. 

This notice is to announce an industry day to be held 19 June 2008 so that potential suppliers (more specifically defined below) may be prepared to present webbings, hardware components, harness components, and fabrics that may be incorporated into the manufacturing specification to enhance the capability of the system. The USN intends to present design and integration requirements as well as system design concepts during this Industry Day. Participation in this Industry Day is not mandatory and will not preclude any interested vendors (as defined below) from participation in the subsequent procurement. 

This notice is intended for component manufacturers, such as weavers/knitters/spinners of fabric, fabric netting, fabric mesh, webbing, tapes, bindings, and/or sewing threads; and formers of textile, metal, plastic, and/or composite fasteners, closures, connectors, adjusters, and pulls. 

This announcement is NOT intended for vendors or manufacturers of pocketry, flotation, gear carriage vests, hydration, cooling/heating technologies, armor carriers, armor hard plate, fragmentation soft plate, harnesses, webgear, cushion covers, other man-mounted clothing, or any other prime vendors outsourcing to the aforementioned component manufacturers.  

Specific hardware components sought include but are not limited to: webbing closures, pocket attachment hardware, pocket closures, garment closures, rip-cords, and friction adjusters that can be blind-operated with a wetted, gloved, hand; that will operate in the sandy conditions of the Middle East as well as wet rainy conditions; that are durable in extreme heat and cold, that have a matte finish; that have a 66 lb hardware retention strength, are snag resistant; that exhibit salt-fog corrosion resistance, high heat resistance, flame resistance; are  lightweight, low bulk, consistent multiple use, easily replaceable, and that have no parts or components that can accidentally detach or shed under rotor wash, high wind, or light impact.

Specific fabrics and tapes/ webbings sought include but are not limited to those appropriate for load-carrying  (e.g., 7-lb hard armor plate, 10-lb soft armor, 40 pounds of survival items). Such fabrics must be flame and high-heat resistant, and ideally, highly air permeable.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), this is a Request for Information (RFI).  (SECTION 1) GENERAL INFORMATION: The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport, RI (NUWCNPT) issues this Request for Information (RFI) to aid the United States Navy in determining if there is sufficient industrial expertise and interest to proceed with a competitive procurement for the Common Electrical Hull Penetrator (CEHP) common diploop cable (CDC) described below.  This RFI is intended to identify concepts and sources for a CEHP CDC that can survive in a submarine sail environment.  The function of the CDC is to provide a reliable path for the transfer of critical information between outboard masts/sensors and the inboard processing equipment during at-sea missions and pier-side testing.  (SECTION 2) BACKROUND: In January 2007, NAVSEA 073R directed the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport (NUWCNPT) to begin investigating the feasibility of a Common Electrical Hull Penetrator (CEHP) to be used with all future submarine Communications, Imaging and Electronic Warfare (CI&EW) antennas and sensors.  The electrical hull penetrator (EHP) is the SUBSAFE boundary between the masts/sensors in the submarine sail and the inboard processing equipment.  The resulting study determined that with current technology, the use of a CEHP is possible.  In March 2008, NAVSEA 073R directed NUWCNPT to begin investigating near term changes to current systems and future system developments to aid in the design of a CEHP.  In addition, NUWCNPT was to look at the feasibility of a common diploop cable (CDC).  The diploop cable provides the connection between the mast/sensor and the EHP.  The diploop cable is fed through a series of rollers in either the Universal Modular Mast (UMM) or Mast Mechanical Group (MMG) which raises and lowers the masts/sensors.  Thus, constant flexing and bending of the cable should be expected.  The CEHP CDC is expected to be a purpose built, mixed conductor cable assembly consisting of coax, #12-#16 AWG copper, and fiber optic conductors, both Single Mode (SM) and Polarization Maintaining (PM).  Standard construction and pressure balanced cables will be considered.  (SECTION 3) TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CDC:  (1) The cable assembly shall not be degraded by active or passive corrosion due to leakage currents or galvanic action over a 20 year service life.  (2) CDC shall consist of the following: Qty(3) #12 AWG TSP – 6 conductors, Qty(4) #16 AWG TSP – 8 conductors, Qty(2)#16 AWG TST – 6 conductors, Qty(3) Coax – 3 conductors, Qty(1) #16 AWG Single – 1 conductor, Qty(9) Fiber – 9 conductors.  (3) Coax cables shall be IW 2303 or industry equivalent.  (4) The nine fiber conductors shall consist of 2 polarization maintaining (PM) fibers and 7 single mode (SM) fibers.  Mil-spec components should be used where appropriate.  Commercial telecom proven components and ruggedized components that have been developed for military applications shall be used when their specifications exceed the current Mil-spec or when no appropriate Mil-spec exists.  (5) CDC shall be prepared in a manner that offers maximum flexibility with a circular core cross section, minimum amount of twist under loading and would avoid conductor defects such as kinks and twists which would shorten cable life.  Use of fillers would be acceptable.  Circular cross section should not be altered by exposure to pressure or other testing.  (6) EMI Shield shall consist of two layers of #36 AWG tinned copper braid with 95% optical coverage, minimum.  (7) CDC shall be capable of reliably operating after being cycled through a UMM and MMG for a minimum of 10,000 cycles.  (8) The cable outer jacket shall prevent water entry under a continuous hydrostatic pressure of 1000 PSI (sea water environment).  This hydrostatic pressure shall have no detrimental effect on cable performance or electrical characteristics.  (9) The cable will be over molded with a polyurethane jacket of sufficient thickness to be resilient and resistant to tear, punctures or similar damage.  (10) The outer diameter of the cable shall not exceed 1.45 inches.  (11) The cable shall meet the cold bend requirements of MIL-C-24643 for cables having a diameter greater than .5 inches.  The conditioning temperature shall be -28C, +0C, -2C.  (12) The insulation resistance between mutually insulated conductors (excluding coaxial cables) and between any conductor and shield grounds shall be 1000 mega ohms minimum when tested in accordance with MIL-STD-202, Method 302, at 500VDC.  (13) The cable assembly conductors shall withstand, without insulation breakdown, 1000 Vrms between any mutual conductors (including shields).  (14) The operating temperature shall be -54C to +65C and the non-operating temperature shall be -62C to +71C, In addition, the cable should be capable of withstanding without failure naval vibration and underwater explosion environments. (15) Referenced Documents: PPD 802-6335747 Shock Qualification for Submarine External Components, S9320-AM-PRO-020/MLDG Molding and Inspection Procedure.  (SECTION 4) REQUESTED INFORMATION: This RFI is intended to gather information regarding possible technical solutions and their characteristics.  NUWCNPT’s goal is to use the information collected to develop an acquisition strategy for a competitive best value acquisition.  Information desired at this time includes: (a) Proposed technical solution with/without modeling and simulation (b)Cost estimates (NRE and production) (c) Development schedule (including prototype, modeling and simulation, and production) (d) Minimum production runs  (e) Production lead times (f) Relevant experience (g) Exceptions – Identify requirements specified that will not be met (h) Identify any alternative solutions that could fulfill the Navy’s objectives. Include the following contact information with your submission:  company name, address, and primary engineering and program management points of contact (including name, phone number, and email address).

Two 12-foot lead wires, connected by a bridge wire in the ignition charge, extend through a rubber (or rubber and sulfur) plug assembly in the open end of the cup. Two circumferential crimps secure the plug assembly in the cup. The Electric Blasting Cap M6 is used to initiate high explosives with a blasting machine or other suitable source of electric power. It is capable of detonating all standard military explosives.<BR><BR><BR>DODIC M131, NSN 1375-01-315-1335, Cap, Blasting, Non-Electric, M7 Assembly.

This non-electric blasting cap consists of an aluminum alloy cup containing an ignition charge of lead styphnate, an intermediate charge of lead azide, and a base charge of RDX.  The cup is flared at the mouth to mate with the matching shape of the nipple of a firing device. Base coupling and the flared end facilitates insertion of time-blasting fuse or detonating cord. The non-electric blasting cap M7 is used to detonate all military explosives.  When initiated by time-blasting fuse, primer or detonating cord the ignition charge detonates the intermediate charge which detonates the base charge, in turn.

<DESC>The Maintenance and Logistics Command, Pacific, Vessels Division intends to contract with   Patriot Contracting Services, LLC to review the existing planning documents prepared during the initial layup of the USCGC POLAR STAR, review the current condition of the cutter and the lay-up actions taken (relative to earlier plans), prepare a baseline lay-up plan, a recurring maintenance plan, and a baseline reactivation plan for only the hull, mechanical and electrical systems.  Cost estimates shall be included for annual maintenance requirements ranging from one to ten years.  Plans shall include required resources (dollars and USCG and/or commercial manpower), and shall address any changes to the baseline reactivation plan.

After extensive market research, the Coast Guard has concluded that Patriot Contracting Services, LLC is the only firm with the resident capability to perform this work.  Notwithstanding Patriot's capability, alternate sources may request the opportunity to present bids.  In order to do so, such alternate sources must no later than 6/27/08, and to the satisfaction of the contracting officer: (1) demonstrate the ability to perform at least 51% of the entire effort with in-house resources and expertise, and (2) demonstrate that it has successfully accomplished nearly identical efforts on ships managed by any of the following: U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, NOAA, Army Corps of Engineers, or Military Sealift Command.

NOTICE UPDATE: The purpose of this update is to provide public notice that alternate sources have positively demonstrated the capability to perform the layup study.  Accordingly, MLCPAC will issue a competitive and unrestricted solicitation for this requirement to the sources having demonstrated this capability by the prescribed 6/27/08 deadline.  Expected release date for the solicitation is 8/11/08.

<DESC>The Contractor shall provide consultation services, as specified below. The Center for Disability (CD), Social Security Administration (SSA), utilizes the services of medical staff under contract to adjudicate disability cases (as a member of a team), as well as to review disability claims. Reviews are critical to the successful operation of the program. Most case reviews are for the purpose of determining whether disability decisions made by the State Agencies (Disability Determination Services) are in accordance with SSA guidelines. SSA components may also occasionally seek other services such as medical training or medical advice on disability program-related issues. Contract work does not require direct contact with claimants. The contractor will provide the Government written consultations and/or evaluations resulting from the contractor review of SSA disability case files. Services required are as follows: • Review of medical evidence in one’s specialty (or specialties) as identified in the contract; • Review of medical evidence in other specialties in which the contractor is qualified; • Provide for combined or overall evaluation of a case, which encompasses the contractor’s medical review and that of other MCs; • Consultation with the full-time medical staff as it relates to the development of SSA disability policies, including the development of SSA quality control procedures; Participation in the training of other MC contractors and other personnel from SSA Central Offices, SSA Regional Offices, and/or the State Disability Determination Services; and work with Government and non-Government agencies and/or medical or non-medical personnel that have a related interest to provide input regarding SSA programs and its objectives. Consultants must be capable of providing an acceptable, understandable, written document addressing the medical issues relative to the disability program that arise as a result of the contractor’s case reviews. Consultants are expected to maintain a high level of expertise in their specialty or related areas. Seminars and other Continuing Medical Education (CME) are essential and must be scheduled on non-work time.
