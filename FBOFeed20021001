<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) seeks offers to continue operation of the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry (the Registry). The Public Health Service Act, Section 379, mandates the Registry to facilitate unrelated bone marrow transplantation by matching patients with volunteer unrelated donors. Successful marrow transplants require a close match of tissue types between patient and donor. The Act requires the Registry, among other things, to: (1) establish and maintain a Board of Directors that meets certain compositional requirements; (2) establish and manage a system for finding marrow donors suitably matched to unrelated patients who need a marrow transplant; (3) conduct public education activities regarding the availability of unrelated donor transplants facilitated by the Registry and the need for additional donors; (4) recruit and conduct tissue typing of potential marrow donors; (5) maintain a nationwide registry of potential volunteer donors and a scientific registry of recipients of unrelated donor transplants; (6) establish standards for tissue typing, donor selection criteria, and procedures for marrow collection and transportation; (7) collect, analyze and publish data pertinent to unrelated donor marrow transplantation and the operation of the Registry, including data concerning patient outcomes at each transplant center; (8) provide advocacy and case management services to patients and donors; and (9) conduct other activities to increase marrow donation and the success of unrelated donor marrow transplants, and to reduce the differences in the chances of finding a matched donor between Caucasians and other population groups.

The Registry currently maintains formal agreements with numerous organizations in the U.S. and other countries, including 136 transplant centers, 91 donor centers, 16 foreign cooperative registries, 9 recruitment groups, 90 apheresis centers, 110 marrow collection centers, 11 cord blood banks, 22 laboratories, and 3 tissue repositories. The Registry contains 4.6 million volunteer potential donors. Each year, the Registry conducts approximately 8,000 searches for donors and facilitates nearly 2,000 transplants, many of them involving foreign donors or patients. The Registry must comply with Section 379 of the Public Health Service Act and other pertinent Federal requirements related to informed consent, confidentiality and privacy, data collection and publication, and computer security. The Registry submits proposed international agreements to HRSA for submission to the Department of State for clearance. Federal funding of the Registry began in 1987 with a grant from the Department of the Navy; Department of Health and Human Services funding began in 1990. The fiscal year 2002 HRSA appropriation for the Registry approximates $20 million. The Government contemplates awarding a cost-reimbursement contract with one base period and four one-year options.

Sources of further information include the Public Health Service Act and the web sites of: the current Registry contractor, the National Marrow Donor Program www.marrow.org, and the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry www.ibmtr.org. The agency will consider proposals from all responsible sources. Send a pre-addressed envelope with your written request to the person above specified to obtain a paper copy of the request for proposals.

The resulting contract(s) if awarded, will require the successful Offeror to furnish all facilities, labor, material, tools and equipment necessary to own, operate and maintain the utility system(s).  The successful Offeror will mana ge the maintenance, repair(s), replacement(s), etc. of the utility system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The successful Offeror shall be responsible for funding a ll capital investment required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the solicitation.  The Offerors proposals and plans may become part of the contract upon the decisio n to award.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP.  No Offeror will be denied the opportunity to submit a proposal in response to the RFP.  Utility system(s) being privatized are described as, but n ot limited to, the following: Electrical System Description:  The main electrical substation is owned and operated by the U.S. Army. The substation contains two 15 MVA power transformers (115 / 13.2 kV) which are energized by two overhead 115 kV three-phase feeders from the Niagara-Moh awk Power Corporation (NiMo). NiMo ownership ends at the 115 kV line dead-end of a lattice steel tower. The Army owned facilities at the WVA main substation include four sets of 115 kV air-break disconnect switches, surge arresters, two sets of three tank-type 115 kV oil circuit breakers, two sets of 115 kV motor-operated disconnect switches, two runs of 120 0 amp copper bus in enclosed bus duct, an outdoor switchgear building with double ended 15 kV rated switchgear, two 1200 amp rated incomer breakers, one 1200 amp bus tie breaker, eight 15 kV feeder breakers, and two spare 15 kV breakers. The distribution system that originates in the main substation contains three loop feeders and two lateral feeders. Power from the main station is transmitted at 13.2 kV.      Almost all of the distribution system is comprised of underground cable feeders, pad-mounted transformers, and loop feed switches. There are approximately 155,000 feet of distribution cable, and 33 substations.  Several substations are inside manufacturing  buildings.  From 1961  1963, the electric distribution system was modernized.  Work included substation replacements, arsenal wide duct bank and cable replacement, and street and security lighting.   Since 1980, installed feeder segments have been either cross-linked  thermosetting polyethylene insulated cables (XLPE) or ethylene propylene rubber insulated cable (EPR). All of the underground feeders are in active service. Only three cable sections have had to be replaced since 1996. Separate duct banks and manholes are  used for communications systems. A series area and street lighting system serves the WVA post. The street lighting system was installed in 1947.  A number of the streetlight poles are ornamental, in keeping with the historical nature of the military Installation.  Natural Gas System Description:  The natural gas system to be privatized provides gas for primarily manufacturing use.  The gas service, from the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, enters the arsenal at 6 pounds per square inch (psig) and is metered at a ga shouse.  At the gashouse, it is reduced to 2.25 psig pressure and dist ributed to various buildings at the arsenal.  Gas distribution lines include:  approximately 600 LF of 3 inch line, 2640 LF of 4 inch line, 1,100 LF of 6 inch line, and 950 LF of 8 inch line.  Of the 5,290 LF total, approximately 1,040 LF are buried and th e remainder 3,250 LF either run in manufacturing buildings or between buildings above ground.  There are 8 main valves and 1 gas meter building.  As built drawings indicate that most of the main gas lines were installed in 1962, with branch lines ranging from 1919 to 1985.  With the exception of approximately 300 feet of 6inch cast iron pipe installed in 1919, all lines are schedule 40 welded steel pipe, with coating or wrap for buried sections.  Underground pipe averages 3 feet in depth.      Gas use includes an emergency generator, steam boiler for process steam, heat treatment furnaces, a paint booth, an air compressor, and a cafeteria. A leak detection survey is conducted on an annual basis. No significant problems have ever been found during the surveys. Note there exists an 8 inch gas line that serves the arsenal boiler plant and a fuel cell located just south of the boiler plant.  This line was installed by the Niagara Mohawk Power Company, and is not part of this privatization effort.   Potable Water System Description:  There are no water treatment facilities on WVA; the potable water supply is purchased from the City of Watervliet (City). The water system consists of main water meter pits, water lines, sectionalizing valves, and fire hy drants. The City of Watervliet supplies water to the Arsenal through 5 main points, with the water distribution system interconnected such that any to all 5 points can service the installation.  The five incoming lines range from 6inch to 8 inch in pipe si ze, and are each metered.  The average age of each meter pit is 8 years, and each pit is equipped with a backflow prevention devices.  All distribution lines are cast iron, and incoming water pressure is 40-60 psig.   The water system consists of approximately 22,100 feet of piping mostly installed in 1948.  Conversations with Installation personnel reveal that some portions of the water system may be older. The system also includes 58 fire hydrants, 51 isolation valves , and 13 post-indicator valves. City water lines surround and traverse portions of the Arsenal, and include a 14-inch main along the northwest side, a 12-inch line along the southwest side, and a 12-inch main along the east side. Sanitary Sewer System Description:  There are no sanitary wastewater treatment facilities at WVA; all sanitary wastewater generated on the Installation is transported to the City of Watervliet.  The arsenal wastewater system consists of collection lines an d manholes. Installation real property records indicate that the wastewater system was installed in 1957. Conversations with installation technicians indicate that some of the wastewater system might have been installed much earlier.  Most of the wastewater generated at WVA flows into a City of Watervliet 27-inch wastewater line that runs along the east side of the Arsenal. The City also has an 8-inch wastewater line, an 8-inch line, and a 12-inch line surrounding the arsenal.  Some was tewater generated on the Arsenal flows to these lines. There are 14 wastewater line connections to the Citys system. The measured length of arsenal wastewater lines is approximately 13,000 feet.  The WVA wastewater system also includes 95 manholes. Note though there is also a storm sewer system, industrial waste sewer system and an industrial wastewater treatment facility at WVA, they are not part of this privatization effort.  This solicitation is to be awarded as a Fixed Price  Price Redetermination  Prospective Utility Services Contract (in accordance with FAR 52.216-5).    The UP solicitation will be issued on or about September 30, 2002.    Direct any questions to Mr. Curt is, Contracting Officer, telephone 309-782-7183 or e-mail: Curtisg @osc.army.mil

The successful Offeror will be required to purchase the existing system from the Government and may  be required to provide expansions to the system(s) to meet future Government requirement(s).  The resulting contract(s) if awarded, will require the successful Offeror to furnish all facilities, labor, material, tools and equipment necessary to own operat e and maintain the utility system(s).  The successful Offeror will manage the maintenance, repair(s) replacement, etc. of the utility system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the servi ce area.  The successful Offeror shall be responsible for funding all capital investment required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the solicitation.  The Offerors p roposals and plans may become part of the contract upon the decision to award.  Past Performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP.  No Offeror will be denied the opportunity to submit a proposal in response to t he RFP.  These Government-owned facilities are currently operated and maintained by contractor personnel.  Utility system(s) being privatized are described, but not limited to:  Potable Water Distribution System, approximately 22 miles of transmission line s ranging in size from 2-inches and less to 16-inches in diameter, 406 main valves, 148 fire and yard hydrants, 127 post indicating valves, 39 manholes, 20 backflow preventers, 52 meters, and a steel elevated storage tank. The distribution system is a mixt ure of cast iron, ductile iron, galvanized steel, copper, asbestos cement, and plastic piping. The source of water for the RIA system is the Mississippi River. The pumping station (Building No. 9) is located on the north central shore of RIA, adjacent to t he river. The pumping station houses two 1500 GPM electric pumps (one rated at 100 40 HP and the other at 75 25 HP) and one emergency 2000 GPM pump with a 100 HP diesel engine. The raw water intake is located directly north of Building No. 9 and is equippe d with debris screens.  Charcoal is added at this point.  The deep well (Building No.51) was constructed in 1941 and is 1,600 feet deep. It is equipped with screens and a 700 GPM submersible pump. Though the well could conceivably be used in a dire emergen cy for non-potable purposes, it has been physically excised from the potable system to meet EPA requirements. Pending the outcome of an environmental study, the well may or may not be reconnected to the system as a secondary source. The water treatment pla nt (Building No. 50) is a 16,232 square foot facility constructed in 1941. Water is chemically treated for pH, hardness, bacteria, turbidity, taste and odor. Maximum capacity is approximately three million gallons per day (MGD) with an average daily flow o f .728  0.5 MGD. Effective capacity is approximately 1.7 MGD, with the limiting factor being the required contact time for the chloramine treatment agent. The facility includes chlorination equipment, ammonia room, alum and lime (can be converted to liquid  polymer) feeders, mixing and settling basins, rapid sand filters, sludge holding basins, drying beds, a clear well reservoir with a holding capacity of 750,000 gallons, and a lab. The plant has two high service pumps (one 75 HP 1050 GPM and one 150 HP 210 0 GPM) and an emergency backup 250 HP diesel, 3128 GPM pump. It is equipped with a circular raw metering system, filter metering system, tank hi gh water level meter, and backwash meter. Mixing basins are reinforced concrete with a holding capacity of 15,600 gallons. Concrete floc and settling basins can hold 250,000 gallons.  There is a 750,000 gallon clear well.  The sludge house (Building No. 71 ) has a 5 HP water and sludge pump, float switches, and a 1/4 HP sump pump. Concrete sludge drying beds have a drying area of 7,500 SF. Rock Island Arsenal has one steel elevated storage tank (Structure No. 236 built in 1952) with a holding capacity of 500 ,000 gallons. The structure is equipped with cathodic protection, depth indicators, warning system, and altitude transmitter. A 10-foot depth is maintained at all times for fire protection purposes; Sanitary Waster Water System, there is no sewage treatmen t or sewage treatment facility associated with the Sanitary Wastewater Collection System. The collection system consists of approximately 12 miles of pipe ranging in size from 4-inches and less to 30-inches in diameter, 5 sewage pump/lift stations, force m ains, manholes, interceptors, and three septic tanks with leach fields. The main cantonment system is comprised of brick, stone, cast iron, plastic, and reinforced concrete vitrified clay piping. There are approximately 5,200 linear feet of brick/stone arc hed collection lines constructed in the late 19th century which are still being used.  The average age of the entire system is over 60 years. Portions of the wastewater system require major work. One complicating factor on some of the areas requiring repai r is that they are located underneath some of the large structures. If relining is not feasible, these lines may well have to be abandoned and relocated. Significant problem areas are repaired as needed. One minor notice of violation (NOV) was issued in No vember 1997. The peak daily flow, pumped to the City of Rock Island, has averaged approximately 1.5 0.4 MGD for the last several years. A gradual increase in flow in the last several years (since the major flood of 1993), despite water conservation measure s, would indicate a probable increase in infiltration. Building No. 204 is the main pumping station from which RIA sewage is pumped to the City of Rock Island. It is a three-level, reinforced concrete circular wet well constructed in 1942 with the two lowe r levels underground. It has two one gravity flow inlets: one 10-inch reinforced concrete pipe from Kingsbury Ave and one 30-36 inch reinforced concrete pipe from the east. Effluent to the City of Rock Island treatment plant is pumped through a 16-inch asb estos-cement force main. The three main pumps are 1750 GPM powered by three 40 HP motors. The sump pump is rated at 50 gallons per minute. The station has a dedicated emergency generator, comminutor, and sufficient instrumentation to control, monitor, and record flow rates.  This solicitation is to be awarded as a Fixed Price  Price Redetermination  Prospective Utility Services Contract (in accordance with FAR 52.216-5). Direct any questions to Mr. Crutis, telephone 309-782-7183 or e-mail: Curtisg@osc.arm y.mil.  The UP solicitation will be issued on or about  September 30, 2002.

<DESC>Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services are required for the construction of the new United States Courthouse located in the central business district of Rockford, IL.  The scope of the CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and a unilateral Option for Construction Phase Services.  A Firm, Fixed-Price Incentive contract is contemplated.  The CMc?s price for Pre-construction Phase Services will form the base contract and Construction Phase Services will be evaluated as an Option.  The Option pricing will be broken down into the following categories: Construction Management (lump sum); General Construction (not-to-exceed price); profit, overhead, and daily delay rates; subcontractor commission; and general conditions.  These Option prices will be evaluated prior to the selection of the CMc; but,  before the Option is exercised, a firm, fixed price will be negotiated for the General Construction services based on the finalized design documents.  If the CMc and the Government cannot agree on a fixed price for the General Construction Services, the entire Option will not be exercised and the Construction Phase Services will be competitively bid on the open market.
Project Summary:  For the construction portion of this project, the General Services Administration (GSA) proposes to construct a 150,000 gross square foot Federal Courthouse that will house the U.S. District Court, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, U.S. Marshal Service and the U. S. Attorney as the major tenants, as well as 55 indoor parking spaces.  The Courthouse will be constructed to meet the 10-year need of the Court and Court-related agencies with a building and site able to accommodate their 30-year expansion requirements.  The new Courthouse will contain five Courtrooms (1 District, 1 Ceremonial, 1 magistrate and 2 Bankruptcy).  The estimated cost of construction is approximately $35-45 million (this amount does not include Pre-construction Phase Services), with a construction duration of approximately 30 months.  Currently funds are available for the base contract, but are not available for the construction Option.  Selection of the CMc?type firm will be in accordance with the FAR Part 15 Source Selection Procedures and the Best Value Trade-off process.  All elements of work to be executed must be within the Congressionally mandated cost limitation. 
Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor.  A CMc contractor is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner or client (in this case the GSA) to provide services such as design review, cost estimating, sustainability review, scheduling and general construction services.  The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs).  In contrast to a CM that is not also a constructor, the CMc is at risk and is involved with project development and administration of the construction.  The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the design and construction phases, working with the A/E and the Government to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget.  The CMc contractor will perform services including, but not limited to:  evaluating design concepts, monitoring A-E progress, coordinating design reviews, reviewing designs, reviewing and preparing cost estimates, tracking costs associated with warm/lit shell and tenant improvements, controlling schedules, keeping records, reporting on design and construction progress, conducting Value Engineering (VE) exercises, conducting constructability reviews, constructing the facility at or below the defined budget or Estimated Construction Cost at Award (ECCA), administering the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordinating construction meetings, CPM scheduling, monitoring construction costs and performing administrative and other services as defined in the scope of work to provide for a completely functional facility.  At the time of the CMc contract award, which is projected to coincide with the beginning of the Design Development Phase, project development shall occur in general conformance with the process described in the American Institute of Architects Document A121/CMc  (also known as AGS Document 565) and the Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner and Construction Manager Where The Construction Manager Is Also The Constructor.
Proposal Submission Requirements.  Proposals will be evaluated using the Source Selection Best Value Process.  Offerors must submit information addressing the technical evaluation factors identified in the Request for Proposal (RFP) that will be evaluated by the Source Selection Board in order to narrow the field to a competitive range of the most qualified firms.  These firms will then be invited to deliver an oral presentation that will take place in Chicago, IL.  After these presentations, prices from the Offerors still in the competitive range will be considered.  A Best Value Trade-off process will determine which offer is in the best interests of the Government.  For this procurement, technical factors, when combined, are more important than cost or price.  The Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial proposals without conducting negotiations.
Contract Award.  The base contract will be awarded to the selected firm to provide Pre-construction Phase services.  Option prices will be accepted for Construction Phase services at the time of the base contract award, but will be negotiated once design documents are completed.
Technical Evaluation Factors.  
For the purposes of evaluation, similar projects are defined as construction of new buildings with a complex program, a size of approximately 100,000 gross square feet or more, and an estimated construction cost in excess of $25,000,000.00.  Contractors that cannot meet all minimum requirements of the evaluation factors are not advised to avoid submitting an offer.  Points can still be earned for factors where not all aspects of the standard for evaluation are met, but Offerors should consider the extent to which their shortcomings would affect their overall scores, and thereby their chances of being included in the competitive range.  The following evaluation factors are in descending order of importance.  1.  Experience Providing Pre-construction, Construction Management, and General Construction Services on Similar Projects.  For this factor, Offerors shall submit up to six (6) similar projects completed in the last five (5) years, where the Offeror performed as CMc, CM at Risk, or as a traditional General Contractor.  Two projects should demonstrate the Offeror?s experience providing Pre-construction Services, two should demonstrate experience as a Construction Manager and two should demonstrate experience as a General Contractor.  It is acceptable for Offerors to submit the same two projects as examples under each of the three categories, but no more than six projects will be evaluated overall.  2. Past Performance Providing Pre-construction, Construction Management and General Construction Services on Similar Projects.  For this factor, Offerors shall submit references for each of the projects submitted under Evaluation Factor Number 1 that demonstrate satisfactory performance based on responses to GSA?s Past Performance Questionnaire.  3. Qualifications and Experience of Key Personnel.  This factor evaluates the experience and qualifications of key team members and their availability and responsibility to the proposed project  4. Project Management Plan.  This factor evaluates the Offeror?s methods and means to ensure successful completion of the project on time, on budget, and within quality expectations, as well as subcontracting goals.
Small Business Participation.  This procurement is open to both large and small business concerns in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 233320, and the corresponding size standard for determining whether or not a firm qualifies as a small business is $27.5 million in average, annual receipts (gross) over the past three years.  Although this procurement is not set aside for small business, small firms (including woman-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, and Veteran-Owned small firms) are strongly encouraged to participate.  In accordance with 15 USC 631, large businesses will be required to provide these small firms the maximum practical opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  Each large firm will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan that meets, and preferably exceeds, the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals established by the Small Business Administration (SBA).  An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of this contract.  Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.  However, ALL firms seeking consideration for this contract will need to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest possible subcontracting goals for local (Rockford area) business concern participation.  Contractors will submit a written narrative (limited to one type-written page) along with their offers that outlines their outreach efforts made to utilize local firms.  In order to receive the benefit of a price evaluation preference as a HUBZone small business concern and/or a small disadvantaged business concern, firms must be certified by the SBA.  Please refer to the SBA website for details at www.sba.gov.  
Joint Ventures.  Joint venture or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality CMc team effort.  
How to Offer.  Potential Offerors having the capabilities to perform the services described herein are invited to request a copy of Solicitation GS05P02GBC0089 by submitting a one-page letter of interest on company letterhead to Maria E.

<DESC>The Surveillance Research Program within the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, plans to negotiate with the Cherokee Nation, Tahlequah, Oklahoma, for a contract, for a two-year period plus two one-year options, to continue capacity building for a cancer registry for the American Indians residing in the 14-county Cherokee Nation Tribal Jurisdictional Service Area (TJSA) who are eligible for health care through Tribal or Indian Health Service (IHS)-operated health care facilities.  Currently the number of eligible users is approximately 100,000. The ultimate goal of the project is the establishment of a population-based cancer registry, to be called the Cherokee Nation Cancer Registry, that will meet the standards of the NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program in case finding, patient follow-up, data processing, data reporting, and quality assurance by February 14, 2007.  At that time the contract may be extended to maintain the registry at  SEER standards.  The information to be collected will assist in measuring the burden of cancer among American Indian populations of the United States.  With the data, NCI anticipates improving its estimates for cancer rates among this group.  It is expected that the Cherokee Nation shall share costs for the establishment of the registry and assist in the development of agreements with the hospitals, clinics, pathology laboratories and other entities where data on American Indian cancer cases can be obtained.  The statutory authority for the noncompetitive acquisition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Numbered Note 22 is included and reads as follows:   The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of  FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of  publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida, intends to conduct a limited competition between Bell Avon, Inc. of Picayune, MS and B/E Aerospace-SMR Technologies, Inc. of Fenwick, WV to award a firm fixed price contract to manufacture LCAC Skirt System Segments.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has conducted a qualification program for manufacturers fabricating LCAC flexible skirt systems. These manufacturers were qualified in accordance with Government document No. 802-6336529, LANDING CRAFT, AIR CUSHION, PROJECT PECULIAR DOCUMENT, SKIRT MATERIAL CHARACTERISTICS AND REQUIREMENTS DATED 01 APRIL, 1996, Revision C and document No. 802-6336530, LANDING CRAFT, AIR CUSHION, PROJECT PECULIAR DOCUMENT, SKIRT FABRICATION PROCEDURES dated 01 April, 1996, Revision B.  To date only Bell Avon, Inc. and B/E Aerospace-SMR Technologies have been certified as capable of providing the required LCAC flexible skirt systems.  As such these are the only two firms capable of competing for this requirement.  Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition.

<DESC>Engineering Services are required under an indefinite quantity contract for Naval Installations throughout the United States. These Services are required for preparation of Preliminary Range Assessments at Closed, Transferred and Transferring (CTT) Ranges owned by the U.S. Navy.  The objective of the Preliminary Range Assessment (PRA) is to determine if a CTT Range poses a threat to public health or the environment, to identify if the nature of such threat is from explosive hazard, constituent contamination, or both and to set priorities for further remedial investigation.   In addition, the PRA will identify the need for accelerated, interim remedial actions or response actions should conditions posing an imminent hazard exist. The PRA phase is based primarily on available information but may include limited field investigation as appropriate.

The scope of the PRA shall be based on limited DoD guidance for performing response actions on military ranges and EPA guidance for conducting CERCLA PAs, as well as USACE guidance on ordnance and explosive response actions under the Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP) for Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS). The PRA shall consist of a limited-scope investigation designed to assess if there is a reasonable probability that the conditions at the CTT range could pose a hazard due to any military munitions, including unexploded ordnance (UXO), and/or other constituents found at the range.  Reports will utilize GIS file formats, as specified by the government, to document spatial information associated with the ranges. 

Other work which may be required at the discretion of the Navy includes revision of the risk assessment code (RAC) for the ranges that have undergone the PRA, sampling and geophysical surveys to confirm or deny suspected  burial sites, documentation of areas that require no further evaluation as well as interim response actions including marking, fencing, or removal and disposal of material containing ordnance and/or its constituents.  Additionally, at the discretion of the Government, subsequent phases of investigation deemed necessary for site disposition could be required.  

Firms are advised that work could potentially involve close contact with hazardous materials/wastes and UXO in various settings. Firms unable to accept work in these environments need not apply.

In the event that design services are required, the following pre-priced options may be exercised at the discretion of the government: 0 - 35% design, 35 - 100% design and Post Construction Contract Award Services (PCAS) such as shop drawing review/approval, consultation during construction, construction inspection services and preparation of record drawings. Options are normally exercised within several months of completing prior work, however, delays of up to one year are possible.

At the Government's discretion, issuance of requests for proposal, submission of proposals and contractual actions such as modifications to the contract, award of individual task orders and modifications thereto will utilize electronic documents.  Specific procedures for these processes will be established after award, however, the transmission of documents shall be in accordance with Federal Information Processing Standards  Publication 186-2 (Digital Signature Standard) and documents will generally be transmitted in the Adobe Acrobat Format.  In addition, the selected firm must have on-line access to email via the internet for exchange of correspondence and information.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) intends to solicit research proposals to conduct scientific investigations in Precipitation Measurement Missions consistent with the science goals of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise (ESE). This research announcement will focus primarily on scientific investigations related to current satellite observations of precipitation using measurements from, but not limited to, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), launched in November 1997. The current TRMM science research program consists of a broad range of investigations covering modeling and analysis, algorithm improvements, validation, applications, and outreach efforts, primarily associated with TRMM and other precipitation-related missions and instruments. For information on TRMM see http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov.  A secondary focus of this announcement is research related to future precipitation missions, such as the next generation constellation-based Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission, now in its formulation phase. For information on GPM see http://gpmscience.gsfc.nasa.gov.  This opportunity, which follows earlier TRMM research announcements in 1993, 1996, and 1999, is intended to support precipitation mission-related investigations for a 3-year period.  Participation in this program is open to all categories of domestic and foreign organizations, including educational institutions, industry, non-profit institutions, NASA centers, and other U.S. agencies.  In accordance with NASA policy, all investigations by foreign participants will be conducted  without any exchange of funds.  The complete NRA will be available electronically on the release date, via the Internet at the Research Opportunities Web Page at http://research.nasa.gov under "Office of Earth Science (Code Y)".  A paper copy will be available to those who do not have access to Internet by calling (202) 358-3552 and leaving a voice mail message.  This announcement will be open through December 12, 2002, and proposals may be submitted at any time throughout this period.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) intends to solicit proposals for the investigations that contribute to the NASA's Earth Science Enterprise's multidisciplinary research in climate, chemistry, and global modeling.  The NASA disciplines included in this NRA are the Radiation Sciences program (RSP), the Global Modeling and Analysis Program (GMAP), the Tropospheric Chemistry Program (TCP) and cross-cutting Interdisciplinary Science (IDS) research.   The research solicited in this NRA is designed to address several of the key issues included as part of the US Government's Climate Change Research Initiative.  The CCRI notes the need to improve our understanding of the direct and indirect effects of aerosols as well as changes in concentrations of other radiatively active gases, including tropospheric ozone.   Improved knowledge and understanding of tropospheric clouds and mechanisms that contribute to their evolution are critical to formulation and verification of methods to realistically capture cycling of water in regional and large-scale climate models.  Proposals are solicited for instrument development/improvement, and modeling and analysis of data from past field missions (e.g.  http://www-c4.ucsd.edu/NACIP  ) concept and will establish NASA participation through this NRA. The TCP supports satellite remote sensing in the study of the distribution of and the processes that control tropospheric ozone and its precursor hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides and will emphasize chemistry-climate coupling, especially in the context of the potential climate impact of the generation and transport of regional pollution to global scales.  Proposals are solicited for the analysis of existing field mission sets (e.g.  http://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/mission/validation.html ).   Trace gases, in particular CO, CH4 and CO2, contribute to the uncertainty in our understanding of carbon cycling and their impact on radiative forcing.  Understanding the large-scale distribution of these gases will be done in coordination with the North American Carbon Program (NACP) ( http://www.esig.ucar.edu/nacp/nacp.pdf	).  Proposals for the improvement and/or intercomparison of existing instrumentation focused on the rapid response measurement of these gases from suborbital platforms are encouraged.    The GMAP supports research to understand and predict the behavior of the global earth system on three important time scales: weather, near-term climate variability and long-term climate change.  Research activities in this area must demonstrate direct linkage and contribution to NASA's core modeling efforts at Data Assimilation Office (DAO), NASA Seasonal to Interannual Prediction Project (NSIPP), and Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS). This NRA will consider proposals that address model initialization strategy, data assimilation, model integration, model uncertainty reduction, satellite and model data comparisons, and model products for management and policy decision support processes. The NRA will be available electronically on the release date, via the Internet at the Research Opportunities home page at  http://research.hq.nasa.gov/research.cfm  under ''Office of Earth Science (Code Y)''. This announcement will be open for the period from October 11, 2002 through December 12, 2002, and proposals may be submitted at any time throughout that period.

<DESC>Licensable Technologies ? LEAD-FREE ELECTRIC MATCH COMPOSITION

Applications of the Technology
Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has developed a lead-free electric match for pyrotechnic and other ignition applications.  Most commercially available electric matches contain lead-based compositions in the match head.  Using a composition that is lead-free and which emits no lead-containing smoke after ignition, the LANL electric match is safer than those commercially-available lead-based compositions for match heads that are currently available for pyrotechnic applications.  In addition to emitting no lead contamination upon ignition, the Los Alamos electric match performs well in ignition applications and is highly reliable.  Los Alamos scientists have achieved these results using metastable intermolecular composites (MIC) in the match head composition.  

Advantages 
Use of lead-based compositions in electric matches has been virtually unavoidable due to the ignition properties of those match head compositions.  Lead-based materials have been the only compositions capable of achieving the charge ignition goals of users.  The smoke emitted from commercially available lead-based electric matches contains harmful lead compositions that present potential environmental and health problems resulting from exposure to lead contaminants.  The LANL electric match avoids this danger through the use of MIC in the match head composition.  The MIC material is extremely sensitive and has a very rapid reaction rate from thermal stimuli.  Additionally, the LANL electric match is more resistant to static electricity that could inadvertently spark an ignition.  The electric match developed at Los Alamos also meets all U.S. Department of Transportation standards for resistance to ignition during transport.  

Testing of the LANL electric match has demonstrated excellent results.  Such testing reveals performance results comparable to the lead-containing commercially available electric matches.  The Los Alamos match reacts as fast or faster to ignition sources than commercially available electric matches.  Additionally, the Los Alamos electric match is brighter (therefore hotter) than commercially available products.  That the LANL electric match is resistant to static is advantageous for operators to avoid inadvertent ignition of pyrotechnic devices creating a safer medium for operation.  Finally, the LANL electric match head composition can be modified with relative ease to slow the ignition reaction of the pyrotechnic device if desired by the user.  

Users of the Technology
Electric match manufacturers for pyrotechnic devices.  Any user who needs electric charge ignition including for use in automobile airbags, the blasting industry, military applications and in fireworks displays.

Status
LANL is seeking interested parties to license and manufacture this technology for commercial use.  Such parties need to have an understanding of pyrotechnic devices and the utilization of electric matches therein.  Letters of interest from such parties regarding the above technology should be directed to the point of contact below no later than October 31, 2002.  

A United States Patent Application was filed on this technology on July 29, 2002, S.N. 10/208,696 (U.S. Deparment of Energy Reference No. S-97,809).

<DESC>The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), National Institutes of Health, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the North Shore University Hospital for a five year continuation of a project entitled "Genetics of Rheumatoid Arthritis."  During the next five years of this project the contractor will: 1) expand the analysis of sib pairs to include existing national and international collections and perform Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) analyses on all sib pair collections; 2) collect 1,000 rheumatoid arthritis trios to conduct association studies based on genetic regions of interest identified during sib pair analysis; and 3) establish collaborative arrangements for the conduct of hypotheses driven projects using resources previously generated.  The projects will focus on genetics, pathogenesis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.  A determination for the use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. 

The North Shore University Hospital has the prerequisite knowledge and experience because of their preliminary and current work under contract N01-AR-7-2232 entitled "Genetics of Rheumatoid Arthritis."

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) seeks offers to continue operation of the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry (the Registry). The Public Health Service Act, Section 379, mandates the Registry to facilitate unrelated bone marrow transplantation by matching patients with volunteer unrelated donors. Successful marrow transplants require a close match of tissue types between patient and donor. The Act requires the Registry, among other things, to: (1) establish and maintain a Board of Directors that meets certain compositional requirements; (2) establish and manage a system for finding marrow donors suitably matched to unrelated patients who need a marrow transplant; (3) conduct public education activities regarding the availability of unrelated donor transplants facilitated by the Registry and the need for additional donors; (4) recruit and conduct tissue typing of potential marrow donors; (5) maintain a nationwide registry of potential volunteer donors and a scientific registry of recipients of unrelated donor transplants; (6) establish standards for tissue typing, donor selection criteria, and procedures for marrow collection and transportation; (7) collect, analyze and publish data pertinent to unrelated donor marrow transplantation and the operation of the Registry, including data concerning patient outcomes at each transplant center; (8) provide advocacy and case management services to patients and donors; and (9) conduct other activities to increase marrow donation and the success of unrelated donor marrow transplants, and to reduce the differences in the chances of finding a matched donor between Caucasians and other population groups.

The Registry currently maintains formal agreements with numerous organizations in the U.S. and other countries, including 136 transplant centers, 91 donor centers, 16 foreign cooperative registries, 9 recruitment groups, 90 apheresis centers, 110 marrow collection centers, 11 cord blood banks, 22 laboratories, and 3 tissue repositories. The Registry contains 4.6 million volunteer potential donors. Each year, the Registry conducts approximately 8,000 searches for donors and facilitates nearly 2,000 transplants, many of them involving foreign donors or patients. The Registry must comply with Section 379 of the Public Health Service Act and other pertinent Federal requirements related to informed consent, confidentiality and privacy, data collection and publication, and computer security. The Registry submits proposed international agreements to HRSA for submission to the Department of State for clearance. Federal funding of the Registry began in 1987 with a grant from the Department of the Navy; Department of Health and Human Services funding began in 1990. The fiscal year 2002 HRSA appropriation for the Registry approximates $20 million. The Government contemplates awarding a cost-reimbursement contract with one base period and four one-year options.

Sources of further information include the Public Health Service Act and the web sites of: the current Registry contractor, the National Marrow Donor Program www.marrow.org, and the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry www.ibmtr.org. The agency will consider proposals from all responsible sources. Send a pre-addressed envelope with your written request to the person above specified to obtain a paper copy of the request for proposals.

In the skin diseases area, inflammatory, autoimmune, and genetic skin diseases are included as are small trials for innovative therapies on wound healing.  It is anticipated that three to five cost reimbursement contract awards will be made for a maximum period of five years beginning on or about May 30, 2002.

A National Coordination Office (NCO) was established in October 1999 to provide support to the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC), a brain bank that was established in 1998 as a resource for fluids and post-mortem CNS tissue samples from well-characterized advanced stage, HIV-infected patients. NIMH seeks the support of a Contractor to provide NCO services to the NNTC which will: (1) maintain and expand the centralized inventory database on a secure network server that contains unidentifiable patient-related clinical information (such as: cognitive status, drug use history, neuropsychology history, CD4 count) and general demographics, pathological data, specimen inventory, and researcher's requests; (2) maintain and monitor a password-protected website accessible to authorized users; (3) serve as an information conduit between the consortium and the public, producing appropriate public relations materials on behalf of the NNTC, including maintaining and updating a public NNTC website, and providing toll free telephone access by which researchers can contact the NCO; (4) collect requests from researchers for specimens, distribute requests to individual NNTC sites, coordinate the shipments of samples, and follow-up on receipt of tissue and fluid delivery; and (5) train NNTC staff in any new database entry methods as a result of approved changes in current database operation and, more specifically, provide them with technical assistance related to data transfer.


A performance based, cost reimbursement plus award fee, five (5) year base contract with four (4), one (1) year options is contemplated.  Plans are to award a contract in early 2003.

<DESC>The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), National Institutes of Health, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the North Shore University Hospital for a five year continuation of a project entitled "Genetics of Rheumatoid Arthritis."  During the next five years of this project the contractor will: 1) expand the analysis of sib pairs to include existing national and international collections and perform Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) analyses on all sib pair collections; 2) collect 1,000 rheumatoid arthritis trios to conduct association studies based on genetic regions of interest identified during sib pair analysis; and 3) establish collaborative arrangements for the conduct of hypotheses driven projects using resources previously generated.  The projects will focus on genetics, pathogenesis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.  A determination for the use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. 

The North Shore University Hospital has the prerequisite knowledge and experience because of their preliminary and current work under contract N01-AR-7-2232 entitled "Genetics of Rheumatoid Arthritis."  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in performance make competition for this additional work unfeasible.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NIAMS.  A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is a RFP available.  Any questions should be directed to Donna Baker, Contracting Officer, Contracts Management Branch, NIAMS, at 301-594-2543 or by e-mail at db394u@nih.gov.  See Note 22

<SUBJECT>A -- Calibration Measurements for L-Band Organic GMTI Radar proof of concept system
<DESC>DARPA intends to enter into a contract with Syracuse Research Corp. (SRC) to perform calibration measurements of the L-Band Organic GMTI Radar (OGR) proof-of-concept system.  The calibration parameters to be measured will be range and angular accuracy, as well as absolute range and angular calibration.  The range and angular accuracy measurements will put a tolerance on all of the measurements made with the radar.  The tolerance is established by analysis of the system parameters.  This anaylysis is then verified with measured test target data.  The purpose of the absolute range and angular calibration is to remove system biases found in all target measurements.  Anlysis of these returns will determine what the correct range and angular calibration values are. Because Syracuse Research Corp. developed the L-Band OGR under a previous Government contract, the company is uniquely familiar with the system and best qualified to perform the necessary calibration tasks.  Furthermore, the system is currently in possession of SRC.  Transfering the system to another vendor to perform the calibration would be cost ineffective.  This notice is published for informational purposes only.  This notice is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  Contractors capable of offering their service must respond within 15 days of the date of this notice by submitting a specific capability statement to provide the service.  All responses received within 15 days after publication of this notice will be considered bu the Government solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

We require the determination of genotypes from DNA isolated from a variety of clinical samples.  These genotypes must be determined using a highly accurate state of the art technology that requires a minimum amount of DNA sample.  This technology must be a proven technology with references of successful (at least 80% efficiency rate) large-scale projects (more than 1000 samples processed per project) in a peer-reviewed journal.  Key aspects of any large-scale genotyping study is the quality and quantity of DNA required to obtain accurate, reliable, and complete results.  The genotyping assay must be robust over a range of DNA concentrations and quality.  For our studies, we require that the assay be able to generate accurate data from 2 nanograms or less of DNA per assay, be able to multiplex at the reaction level to further minimize the required amount of DNA, and have a proven reliability for large scale genotyping studies.  We also require that the data be reported in electronic file format and have a quality parameter associated with each genotype call.  2.0  SCOPE: The contractor shall engage in a contract with three parts and an option for a 4th part.
