source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having
jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight

<p>EVALUATION OF QUOTES<br />The Government will conduct a Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA) evaluation and intends to award a single Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) contract to the responsible quoter whose quote represents the best value. In order to be considered awardeable, a quoter must have received an "Acceptable" rating in every non-price factor.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p>Factor I: Technical Submission (Acceptable/Unacceptable)<br />Factor II: Past Performance (Acceptable/Unacceptable)<br />Factor III: Price</p>
<p>Factor I - Technical Submission: The quoter shall provide detailed information and documentation to include pictures,websites etc in order to demonstrate that their quote meets the requirements identified in this Request for Quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>The technical quotes will be rated acceptable or unaccepatable using the ratings and descriptions outlined in the table below. In order to be considered Acceptable, quoters must receive an acceptable rating for the technical factor in its entirety. The quoter shall provide detailed information and documentation to include pictures,websites etc in order to demonstrate that their quote meets the requirements identified in this Request for Quotation (RFQ). Quotes that fail to provide detailed information and documentation is considered Unacceptable.</p>
<p>Quoters whose technical submittal are rated "Unacceptable" will be rejected and removed from further competition.</p>
<p>Technical Submission Ratings</p>
<p>Rating Description</p>
<p>Acceptable The quote includes all of the required Technical Submission information indicated in the Instructions to the Vendors, the information submitted does not conflict with the requirements herein, and the proposed items meet or exceed the Government's requirements.</p>
<p><br />Unacceptable The quote did not include all of the required Technical Submission information indicated in the Instructions to the Vendors, the information submitted does conflict with the requirements herein, and the proposed items do not meet or exceed the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Factor II - Past Performance Acceptability: The past performance evaluation results is an assessment of the quoter's probability of meeting the minimum past performance solicitation requirements. This assessment is based on the quoter's record of relevant and recent past performance information that pertains to the services outlined in the solicitation requirements. Past performance will be rated on an acceptable or unacceptable basis in accordance with the ratings and description outlined in the table below:</p>
<p>Past Performance Evaluation Ratings</p>
<p>Rating Description<br />Acceptable Based on quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully provide specified facility, or the quoter's performance record is unknown (See note below).<br />Unacceptable Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will be able to successfully provide specified facility</p>
<p>Note: Quoters lacking relevant past performance history or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorable or unfavorable on past performance. Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable." If the Contracting Officer determines that a vendor's Past Performance is "unacceptable," that vendor's entire submittal will no longer be considered for further competition or award.</p>
<p>There are two (2) aspects/subfactors of past performance evaluation:</p>
<p>(1) Relevancy - The agency will evaluate the quoters past performance to determine how relevant a recent effort accomplished by the quoter is to the effort to be acquired. In establishing what is relevant for this acquisition, consideration has been given to those aspects of an quoter's contract history that give the greatest ability to measure whether the quoter will satisfy the current procurement. Evaluation aspects of relevancy will include similarity of scope and magnitude.</p>
<p>Scope: The measure of the similarity of the scope of the solicitation and the contracts submitted by the quoter.</p>
<p>Magnitude: The measure of the similarity of the dollar value of the supply that exists between this requirement and the quoter's references. Magnitude will be evaluated on the dollar amount supplied under the contract(s)/order(s) during the relevant three-year period established by the solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) Quality - Each past performance reference under each quoter's Past Performance quote that is found to have at least some relevance to the requirement will be evaluated to determine the quality of the quoter's performance under that reference. In order to verify past performance information and determine the quality of the past performance quote, the Government may contact some or all of the references provided, as appropriate, and may collect information through questionnaires (Past Performance Report Form), telephone interviews and existing data sources to include but not limited to PPIRS. The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government. This past performance information will be used for the evaluation of past performance. The quality evaluation will be based on the following sub factors: Quality, Timeliness, and Contractor Responsiveness which will be of equal importance.</p>
<p>Factor III - Price Evaluation Criteria: Price quotes will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR 13.106-3. Quoters responding to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the government may request quoters to submit additional information/data to support price reasonableness such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar items, sales history for the same or similar items, price list with effective date and/or copies of catalog pages along with any applicable discounts. Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote.</p>
<p>Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>The Government may evaluate any and all information submitted by the vendor to support the reasonableness of prices quoted. The method of evaluation used by the Contracting Officer is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>DFAR 252.204-7011 ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to <br />ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.<br /><br />(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.<br />Solicitation:</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
