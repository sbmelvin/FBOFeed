<DESC>The South Dakota Natural Resources Conservation Service has a requirement for the digitizing of numerous certified wetland determinations.  

This is a 100 percent set aside for small business.  The applicable NAICS code is 541990 with a small business size standard of $6.0 million.

Originally all of the certified wetland determinations were archived on official USDA maps, which were administered by the Farm Service Agency.  The use of Geographic Information Systems and the Paper Reduction Act has made hard copy official USDA maps obsolete.  Currently digitizing of the certified wetlands is being done on a sporadic basis.  The FSA no longer keeps hard copies of the official USDA maps thus the need for the NRCS to have this information digitized.  

The determinations must be captured within 10 meters of source material at a 95% confidence level.  (Please refer to the Statement of Work included as Attachment A to the Solicitation Package for further information as to the specifications required to complete the work.) The estimated number of tracts to be digitized are as follows:  Area 1 - 3400 tracts; Area 2 - 1400 tracts; and Area 3 - no estimate is available.

The Government anticipates the award of a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contract.  The performance period will be from August 1, 2006 to September 30, 2007.  The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards for this work.  Quotes should reflect the price to complete the work on a per tract basis.  Offerors should indicate the area of preference for which they wish to be considered.  Areas are noted in the Statement of Work/Specifications included as Attachment A in the solicitation package.    

All quotes are due no later than July 17, 2006 at 5:00 p.m. Central Time.  When submitting a response, please indicate the areas in which you have an interest.  Responses should include the qualifications of personnel and description of materials, equipment and services to perform the tasks identified in Attachment A of the solicitation package.

Mr. Price is uniquely qualified to perform these services based on his long and varied experience as an employee with over 40 years of service in DOE. Most recently he was the Federal Project Director for the Spallation Neutron Source Project, which was just completed at ORNL.

During this assignment, Mr. Price was the first federal project director in DOE to be formally certified and is certified at Level 4, i.e. qualified to lead projects greater that $400 million total project cost. He has served on multiple SC independent reviews of other projects and is generally recognized as the most experienced federal project director in SC for large projects.  He has led numerous ORO working groups dealing with project management issues.  Mr. Price also has broad experience, having worked for almost 10 years on environmental projects and over 12 years in DOE headquarters.  Mr. Price is the only known source with the knowledge, required certifications and availability necessary to provide these services.

<DESC>ENTRANCE AND EXIT PORT SELECTION MIRROR ASSEMBLY

The solicitation number is FA8601-06-T-0114.  The proposed contract is for the installation and purchase of entrance and exit port selection mirror assembly and 1200 G/mm, which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1.  The proposed source is McPherson.  The services and supplies being purchased are as follows: One (1) installation, one (1) entrance port selection mirror assembly, for use with side mounted entrance slit assembly, one (1) Exit port mirror assembly, for use with side mounted exit slit assembly.  The government anticipates a sole source award to McPherson for the following reason:  McPherson model 209 spectrometer is currently in use to perform research. The entrance and exit port selection mirror and exit port selection mirror must be compatible with the existing McPherson model 209 spectrometer mounting and electrical controls. To deviate from this upgrade would incur additional costs and a disruption in research. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within ten (10) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any quotation/response should be faxed to Robin M. Hass, 88 CONS/PKBB, 937-656-1412, or e-mailed to Robin.Hass@wpafb.af.mil no later than 10 Jul 06.  Any questions should be directed to Robin M. Hass at 937-522-4647.

Eligible firms will be invited to bid to provide internet access service for the Naples area and service integration for the Lago Patria Site.

JFC Naples is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the MBC. JFC Naples intends to use an envelope/e-mail bidding procedure. Partial bidding is not authorized.

The estimated total value of this project is Euro 300,000 ($383,000 USD) (one base year plus four one-year options). The reference for this project is ACO-NAP-06-42 and all correspondence in relation to this procurement shall refer to this reference. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using as its reference IFIB-ACO-NAP-06-42.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The Internet Service Provider must provide the following circuits and services for two NATO facilities: main circuit, band-width, domain name service, boundary router/s, resilience/circuit backup and optional implementation of voice over IP.

ELIGIBILITY

The IFIB package will contain material classified up to NATO UNCLASSIFIED.

Firms must be certified and have at least five years experience in the field. 

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects.

Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Those firms that are nominated to bid will be added to an electronic distribution list of firms eligible to bid on this ICB project. When the Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB) is issued, those firms will be notified electronically and will be instructed to download the tender documents on the following website: 

http://www.nato.int/shape/community/budfin/ifib/index.htm

As provided for under MBC rules, however, nominations from interested firms will continue to be accepted by the Host Nation after the IFIB is issued and until the bid closing date.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Deadline to be placed on the electronic bidder distribution list: 25 July 2006

2. Planned Release Date of the Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB): August 2006

<ARCHDATE>09292006
<CONTACT>Terry Traino, (732) 532-2675
<DESC>CONTACT Denis Chan, Electronics Engineer, (732) 532-1894. The Government has identified a requirement to increase the ceiling on the Legacy Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radios System (SINCGARS) Omnibus Contract Number W15P7T-05-D-J405 to meet b ackorders and increased surge demands for war requirements. Contract Number W15P7T-05-D-J405 was awarded on a competitive basis to Tallahassee Technologies Inc. (Talla-Tech); 3000 Commonwealth Blvd, Tallahassee, FL 32303 in December 2004 for the manufactur e of General Dynamics (GD) designed SINCARS RT-1523A, RT-1523D, AM-7239 and AM-7238 sustainment spare parts. This contract is a five-year Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) and Time and Materials (T&M), Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract to procur e SINCGARS spare parts and sustainment support for the GD family of SINCGARS. The Government is currently pursuing an effort to modernize the GD family of SINCGARS via obsolescence redesign/upgrade to extend the service life of these equipments. The Govern ment is seeking interest from alternate sources capable of producing a build to print version of these configurations at a rate of 1200 circuit card assemblies (CCA) per month. Contract Number W15P7T-05-D-J405 includes provisions for an Obsolescence Intern al Risk Reserve Fund to address major obsolescence issues. To maximize the flexibility in modernization of the older assemblies, configuration control of the SINCGARS configurations under this contract has been reassigned to Talla-Tech to support this ongo ing redesign effort, resulting in new drawings that have not been delivered to the Government. Consequently, the Technical Data Package (TDP) that supports the manufacture of these assemblies has become unstable because the redesigns are ongoing and drawin gs are not yet delivered to the Government for these redesigned configurations. The Government is seeking to identify sources with the capability to produce sustainment spare parts for the GD family of SINCGARS over the next 3-5 years. Interested sources m ust show that they have the plant capacity to meet monthly demand of up to 1200 SINCGARS CCA. Deliveries must begin within 9 months of contract award to include completion of First Article Testing (FAT) to satisfy the Armys accelerated fielding schedules.  FAT to qualify the production line will be required for all sources, other than Talla-Tech, that are interested in the proposed action. Any source interested in the proposed action will be required to produce the existing version of SINCGARS configuration s. Due to the significant impact of an alternate designed product on the Logistics support system that would be introduced by a different design, the Government requires that the product produced under this effort be a build to print effort. Due to the eng ineering effort that is required to manage the GD SINCGARS configuration base line, interested sources shall have demonstrated capabilities in dealing with SINCGARS or other similar frequency hopping Combat Net Radios in the following categories: (a) manuf acture and repair complex CCA (multi-layers, surface mount technology, through hole, and manual mounted), (b) redesign CCA to eliminate obsolescence, (c) redevelop and/or trouble shoot software, (d) testing at CCA and radio system levels. In addition, the potential bidder shall possess the necessary security clearance to deal with COMSEC equipments. Contract Number W15P7T-05-D-J405 also includes requirements for services, to include the repair of all hardware and ancillary items listed under the contract an d hardware acquired under the contract.  Engineering support services are required to be performed throughout the length of the contract for efforts related to supportability analysis, development, manufacturing and testing and fielding of SINCGARS items d elivered under this contract. Selected engineering tasks include, but are not limited to:  (1) The evaluation of the maintenance concept to ensure the most cost -effective sparing options are maintained on elected models or assemblies affected by obsolete components and (2) the update of field maintenance procedures as required, to include organizational level as well as the AN/GRM software and technical documenta tion support, are required to be performed. Interested sources shall identify their interest and capability to meet the Governments requirements.  Sources capable of providing these items in accordance with the Governments requirements, to include the re quired delivery schedule shall respond in writing.  The response should be a short introductory description (unclassified) outlining a viable approach that meets the above needs and should address production and engineering capabilities. Responses from int erested sources shall address their capability to act as a single provider for the SINCGARS, spares, and services. Submit one electronic copy of the submission to the following: Commander, US Army Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Command Acquisition Center, ATTN: AMSEL-AC-CB- Submit one electronic copy of the submission to the following: Project Manager, Tactical Radio Communications Systems, ATTN: SFAE-C3T-TRC-CF (James Bowden), Bldg 455, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED AS A "100% HUBZONE SET-ASIDE". The SIC Code for this Solicitation is 237130: The Size Standard is $31,000,000.00 This project will replace the existing 1959 vintage 15 kV three phase switching station #1 with modern 15 kV switchgear in a protective enclosure.  The new switching station switchgear lineup will consist of three circuit breakers for circuits B, C, and D with one spare circuit breaker and one spare space for future growth.  The enclosure will protect the equipment from exposure to the salt water/air and protect maintenance personnel when performing circuit breaker maintenance and troubleshooting procedures.  The new 15 kV circuit breakers will have microprocessor controlled protective relaying functions to properly coordinate the power distribution system at this location.  There will be a SCADA-type control system provided to control the functions of the circuit breakers and protective relaying for this switching station.  The control station will be located at the control room of Building 160.  There will be pole line work associated with installation of the new switching station to re-connect the existing circuits fed from the switchgear and to allow circuits to be bypassed during switchgear maintenance procedures.  The new switching station enclosure will be raised to above current flood elevations in that area (13.25 feet above sea level) by construction of a masonry platform with stairway access.  The new elevation of the switchgear will be 14.25 feet above sea level.  The existing truck access for the fuel tanks in this area will be re-graded and repaired to allow access around the new switching station.  Grass sod will be placed in the disturbed area around the new switching station to prevent erosion in this area.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), with TA Instruments to purchase a High Resolution Thermo Gravimetric Analyzer (TGA).  The TGA must include a thermobalance, auto sampler, furnace, purge gas system, control computer, monitor, internet capability, installation, and training.  The instrument must meet the following minimum specifications:
a.	Dynamic Resolution Control: Because the intended application involves studies of several closely coupled decomposition events, the instrument must be capable of automatically adjusting to sample decomposition.  In particular, the instrument must include real-time dynamic heating control – in which the heating rate is automatically and continuously changed by the instrument as decomposition (i.e., sample weight loss) progresses.   
b.	Sensitivity:  The instrument must be able to resolve weight changes of at least 0.1 micrograms.  This sensitivity is required to differentiate small levels of impurities and variations between very small amounts of carbon nanotubes. Because of the sensitivity requirements, the instrument should drift no more than 10 g during heating.
c.	Rapid Thermal Control: The furnace must be able to heat extremely fast, to a temperature of 1200 °C or higher.  This requirement is critical for the intended research.  Linear heating rates must be 500 °C per minute or greater.  The instrument should not overshoot temperature by more than 0.25 °C and must correct within 10 seconds or less.  The instrument must also be compatible with heating rates as slow as 0.5 °C/min. Rapid cooling (Greater than or equal to 100 °C/minute) is also needed.  
d.	Auto sampling:  The instrument must include an integrated robotic auto sampler.  This instrument will be used for numerous measurements on different parts of a larger bulk specimen.  The auto sampler is necessary to minimize operator interaction with the individual specimens.  The instrument must be capable of performing a unique experiment on each sample within a sample tray.  It is preferred that each tray house at least 10 individual samples.  The auto sampler should be capable of directly punching sealed pans with samples in a contamination-free manner.  The system must also have the ability to reject any pan that is not pierced.  
e.	Weighing Capacity: Sample sizes ranging from 1 milligram to 1 gram are anticipated.  The balance must be compatible with specimens across this entire range.  The dynamic weighing range should be optimized to a maximum sample of 100 mg, allowing finer weighing with a small sample.
f.	Temperature Accuracy: Isothermal temperature accuracy should be 1 °C or greater.  Isothermal temperature precision should be 0.1 °C or better.
g.	Gas Switching Capability: The unit must include the capability to apply different gases during measurement.  This switching can be done externally, but gas flow rates must be controlled via digital mass flow controllers.  The flow rate must be programmable within the operating software and the flow rate data must be able to be saved in the data file. The system must be capable of automatic buoyancy corrections for gas flow rate and temperature.
h.	Kinetics Calculations:  The instrument must be capable of calculating and displaying (in real-time) decomposition kinetic parameters for the specimen under test, including activation energy.  The instrument must be able to modulate the temperature of the sample quasi-isothermally (i.e., apply a sinusoidal temperature wave to the sample), allowing evaluation of decomposition kinetics in a single weight loss run.
i.	Vacuum Compatibility:  The thermobalance and furnace must be capable of operating in a slight vacuum (10 to the negative 2 power Torr).  
j.	Compatibility with Other Instrumentation:  The instrument must be easily interfaced with other analytical instrumentation, most notably a mass spectrometer or FTIR spectrometer, to enable characterization of evolved gas constituents.  
k.	Calibration:  The instrument must utilize multiple points for temperature calibration, providing greater temperature accuracy over a wide temperature range.  The instrument should also be capable of Curie Point temperature calibration using an integrated electromagnet.
l.	User Friendliness: The unit must be controlled via supplied data acquisition software. The software must be easy to operate, allowing the user to modify runs in progress, add segments to an active run, and have local control of start/stop.  All software must be included with the unit.
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K). TA Instruments produces the only TGA system that meets all of these specifications. This synopsis is issued for information only. No competitive solicitation is planned. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing to the attention of Ms. Rima (e-mail preferred). Anticipated award date is July 17, 2006.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Laboratory Sciences Molecular Biology Branch prepares and distributes large numbers of DNA aliquots dispensed into micropackaging vials as part of several large-scale DNA banking and genotyping studies of public health significance.  The aliquot vials are currently being labeled by manual application of  barcoded labels to the aliquot tubes.  To increase throughput, an instrument capable of applying high quality 600 dpi labels to micropackaging vials that are stored in 96 placeholder storage racks is needed.  The instrument must be capable of labeling the tubes and returning the tubes to the original location in the storage rack.  SSI FLASH mini-labeler is the only instrument that is designed to pick up the individual tubes, apply labels and return the tubes to the correct position in a storage rack.  It accomplishes this through the use of a robotic head and an XY gantry.  The minimum specifications for a product to fulfill CDC’s needs are:    1)   must be capable of applying high quality 600 dpi labels to micropackaging vials that are stored in up to three 96 placeholder storage racks.  The instrument must be capable of labeling the tubes and returning the tubes to the original location in the storage rack;  2) must be able to accurately locate the 3 tube racks. The racks should be positioned well above the base plate in order to place them at roughly the same height as the cap pickup nest, thus limiting the required Z-stroke of the robot;   3) Label content information should be entered into the system using Excel spreadsheet which we can export from a database;   4)  Instrument should have a keypad user interface to displays machine status and allows for operator input;   5)  Software supplied for label generation/loaded on to customer-supplied PC which allows for 3 text fields and 2 bar-code fields;   6)   The system must be small, light weight, portable and benchtop;   7)   The system must both print variable text on the labels via thermal transfer printer, and also wrap the labels around the tubes;   8)   The system should have potential for upgradeability in the future to add additional functions that may arise at CDC, such as dispensing, capping/uncapping, barcode scanning, microplate-based functions, etc;   9)   The company that supplies the system should have expertise in laboratory process automation, and laboratory software as opposed to purely medical or pharmaceutical process automation;   10)   The equipment should have a successful track record automating similar processes with the Sarstedt 72.730.106 tubes;   11)   The system should be capable of automatically cycling through 3 entire tube holders, labeling each of the tubes and returning them to their original position in the storage rack;   12)   There should be a notification signal to alert the lab staff that the set of three racks is completed;  and   13)   The instrument should be housed in an enclosure consisting of transparent acrylic or other type of windows.  The Government is not aware of any other manufacturer of a similar instrument which is a small, benchtop unit.

Responsible sources that believe they can provide a comparable system are encouraged to submit  to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their written specifications and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Offeror should also provide an estimated delivery schedule. Please submit capabilities and supporting information to:  Brenda L.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency (FSA), in response to an unsolicited proposal, intends to award to EarthData International Inc., a noncompetitive contract for an Automated Crop Cultivation Assessment Tool using a dual-sided, dual-frequency, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IFSAR) mapping system.  The development of this tool is specifically called for in the 2006 USDA Budget to test the concept of supporting FSA’s farm program compliance monitoring and to augment the USDA National Agriculture Photography Program (NAIP).  FSA has identified EarthData International Inc., as the only source technically capable of providing FSA the unique crop assessment tool based on their airborne IFSAR mapping system (GeoSAR).  However, companies believing they can meet the stated requirements are encouraged to submit supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested sources must submit demonstrative supporting evidence by fax, or e-mail to the address listed below no later than 15 calendar days from the date of this announcement.  Responses must include technical statements and other material in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the requirements stated in this announcement.  Further, responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Finally, firms should identify themselves as ether a small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 541922 which is $6 million averaged annual revenue.  This is a Notice of Intent only and not an announcement of a solicitation.  The Government will not pay for any materials furnished in response to this synopsis.  Submittals furnished will not be returned to the sender.  Send all responses to the attention of John Mootz: john.mootz@slc.usda.gov or Fax at (801) 975-3512.

Background:  The FSA is responsible for administering USDA farm programs involving crop commodity price supports, disaster relief, and assistance for conservation practices. FSA administers farm programs in part by digitizing and maintaining agricultural field boundaries, or common land units (CLU) from digital orthoimagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP).  NAIP acquires orthoimagery during peak agricultural growing seasons on an annual basis. CLU boundaries consist of fence lines, waterways, the interface between agricultural vegetative cover and non crop vegetative cover on the surface.  Another key aspect of farm program administration is to verify that agricultural practices are in accordance with USDA program parameters. FSA has performed this verification by using NAIP imagery. The aerial imagery, along with existing program parameters, is viewed in a geographic information system (GIS) at county based USDA Service Centers to show crops and agricultural practices.  CLU boundaries are displayed to assist with identification of farm parcels and area acreages.  If current agricultural conditions cannot be determined from the imagery, due to sub-optimal timing in image acquisition or quality factors, USDA personnel may be required to assess conditions on the ground, which is expensive and time consuming.  The use of NAIP imagery has been very successful in terms of providing current orthoimagery for maintaining CLU boundaries and performing farm program administration.  For most regions of the country, the imagery is acquired within time frames that allow crop/land use verification.  However, in some regions, particularly the southeastern United States, acquisition within specified time windows can lead to the following problems:  (1) Difficulties posed by high humidity and cloud cover characteristic of the southeastern US during the summer months;  (2) Difficulties posed include identifying and digitizing field boundaries through tree/forest canopy or shadows cast due to low sun angle during aerial photo/image acquisition;  (3) Difficulties discerning boundaries between agricultural crops and non-crop vegetative cover that may have similar appearance in natural color or black & white orthoimagery.  Based on information provided from EarthData International Inc., the proposed Automated Crop Cultivation Tool can provide a cost effective solution to these specific problems.

Requirements for test project, titled:
PILOT AUTOMATED CROP CULTIVATION ASSESSMENT TOOL.
Conduct pilot study to determine the feasibility of identifying common crop types from the acquired GeoSAR data sets.  GeoSAR is a dual-sided, dual-frequency, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IFSAR) mapping system integrated onto a Gulfstream II business jet wholly owned by EarthData International.  The system is capable of collecting data from 40,000 ft at an airspeed speed of over 400kts yielding a net collection rate of over 280 sq km per minute.  The SAR operates at 2 frequencies simultaneously, X-Band, with a center frequency of 9700MHz, and P-Band, with a center frequency of 350MHZ.  The system is designed to produce high accuracy digital elevation models (DEM) through the process of radar interferometry, as well as SAR orthophoto mosaics.  GeoSAR will collect simultaneous, precisely registered X and P Band IFSAR imagery over a single county in Mississippi (approximately 1,000 square miles) during the peak growing season of July 15 through August 31, 2006.  The collection will be timed and carried out to demonstrate that the system can collect during the night and during difficult atmospheric conditions when it is often impossible to collect conventional photography.  EarthData will investigate whether the unique characteristics of the X and P band SAR images can facilitate the collection of certain feature types, such as fence lines, that are not readily visible in standard NAIP imagery.  EarthData will also use the GeoSAR X and P band image data to determine whether the common crop types present in the data sets (Corn, Soy, Wheat etc.) are separable within the feature space defined by the GeoSAR data.  This will allow EarthData to determine whether the GeoSAR can be used as a tool to monitor compliance.  Various parametric and non-parametric statistical classification algorithms will be tried to demonstrate this capability.  The use of precisely registered X and P band, along with height maps for both bands, slant plant imagery, etc. can be combined to provide a higher statistical component for evaluation.  

General Requirements:  (1) Data acquisition capability must support rapid, day or night, all weather, clear or cloudy, data collection utilizing synthetic aperture radar (SAR);  (2) Data acquisition and delivery capability must support delivery of final products within 30 days of acquisition;  (3) Products must have comparable resolution to traditional one meter orthoimagery and planimetric accuracy to register within five meters to government furnished geospatial control datasets;  (4) Provide pilot study report including orthoimagery products, digital elevation models, associated metadata;  (5) Products must be visually interpretable, with minimal training requirements at the USDA service center level, to delineate and identify multiple features and objects that may not otherwise be discernable on standard NAIP imagery;  (6) Data products must support automated statistical classification algorithms for crop type verification.

Government Furnished Material.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency, Aerial Photography Field Office will furnish the following materials for use in the performance of this contract:  Crop reporting data, that ties specific crop types to the CLU data for the year flown, current Common Land Unit (CLU) data, and 2005 NAIP 2 meter imagery.

Contract Deliverables:  All data delivered under this contract to USDA shall be placed in the public domain.  (1) 8-bit grayscale and 24-bit RGB mosaics in MrSid format using the X and P orthoimagery; (2) the X and P raw data; (3) digital elevation model, and (4) metadata for items 1-3; (5) final pilot study report. The study will result in a whitepaper that will evaluate the utility of GeoSAR data for the collection of information commonly derived from NAIP imagery, as well as value added products, such as CLU collection and crop program compliance monitoring.

The numeric encoding on each chip (the agency code and chip i.d.) is agency-specific; it’s the virtual equivalent of teeth on a door/car key.  There is no personal information stored on a SmartShield badge chip-transponder just the numeric key encoding the chips encoding is recognized by an RFID (radio frequency identification) reader (provided) which transmits chip-data to the connected computer.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Laura Tomitz, -
<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, 820 Chandler Street, Fort Detrick, MD intends to set aside for a Hub Zone contractor (Note 27) a Performance-based acquisition for sustainment information technology services support for the the U. S. Army Medical Research and Material Commands Theater Enterprise-Wide Logistics System (TEWLS).  The TEWLS system is the newly developed medical logistics information system for the Army Medical Department and U.S. Army Medical Material Agency (USAMMA). The development of TEWLS is a combination of several U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USMRMC) efforts re-hosting the Theater Army Medical Management Information System Medical Supply (TAMMIS MEDSUP) intermediate level supply system capabili ties into the  USAMMA Revolution in Logistics (URL). TAMMIS MEDSUP is a legacy application supporting unit and retail medical logistics requirements used by fixed medical treatment facilities and deployable medical forces. TAMMIS MEDSUP currently operates in Division Medical Supply Offices, Combat Support Hospitals, Medical Logistics Companies, Medical Logistics Support Companies, and Theater Distribution Centers currently located in CONUS, Korea, Iraq, Qatar, and Germany.  The TEWLS solution allows for a n ew division of business processes at the national, regional, and local levels of operations (for example customer vendor, catalog  and inventory management functions should occur at the national and regional level while physical storage and distribution pr ocesses occur at the local level). Re-hosting of TAMMIS intermediate level Class VIII capabilities into Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution using System Application Products (SAP) software, building from the existing USAMMA Revolution in Logistics (URL) ERP information system will enable organizations to continue supporting medical mission support requirements to the war-fighter.  As the Armys medical logistician, USAMMAs core mission is to provide medical acquisition logistics support, medical materiel meeting force projection and sustainment requirements, and serve as the Service Item Control Center for medical materiel. The ini tial URL information system is the Armys medical logistics modernization and transformation initiative that implements ERP solution Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) software from SAP AG. The URL complements logistics modernization efforts on going at the D efense Logistics Agency (DLA) for Business System Modernization the Army in their Single Army Logistics Enterprise initiative (LMP, PLM+, GCSS-Army/Tactical) and the Navy in their Convergence effort (Cabrillo, Smart, Sigma, and NEMAIS). The URL ERP effort began in February 2001 in a phased implementation as a means to adapt commercial best business processes in supporting USAMMAs Assembly Management processes. TEWLS Release 1 provides data harmonization and synchronization of purchasing/materiel data eleme nts inside USAMMA, USAMMCE, 6th MLMC, DSCP, and CENTCOM units, (i.e. medical distribution units, Combat Support Hospitals, and Division Medical Supply Operations) and linking it with USAMMAs Business Intelligence/Business Warehouse (BI/BW) using SAP Maste r Data Management (MDM) and NetWeaver tools. Release 1 also provides the ability to turn-off TAMMIS capabilities at the 6th MLMC by reconfiguring the existing SAP System URL in order to include the following functionality: - USAMMCEs Production, Assembly, Reconstitution, Disassembly System (PARDS) assembly management business processes. - the ability to accept and process funded customer orders. - The ability to process financial transactions with the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) and the Armys Standard Financial Management system (STANFINS) through the Operational Data Store (ODS), as well as the Army Single Stock Fund (ASSF) - The ability to process purchase orders into the Armys Standard Procurement System (SPS) (i.e.process a credit card or local purchase request) . - Enterprise management of customer, vendor, financial, and catalog data.  Responses received from other Hub zone businesses prior to close of business on 7 July 2006 will be evaluated.  Offerors responding to this notice must be CCR registered.

<SUBJECT>R -- Development of a Database of Dietary Supplement Labels
<SOLNBR>263-2006-P-(GI)-0112
<RESPDATE>071006
<CONTACT>Terita Stevenson, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-402-3727, Fax 301-480-1203, Email stevenst@od.nih.gov
<DESC>This announcement is hereby amended to include a closing time to the due date.  ALL INFORMATION SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT MUST ARRIVE ON OR BEFORE THE CLOSING DATE AND TIME.  THE CLOSING DATE FOR RESPONSES IS JULY 10, 2006.  THE CLOSING TIME FOR THE RESPONSES IS 3:30 PM.

The Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), National Institutes of Health, seeks to issue a statement of work (SOW) to obtain services related to the design, development, implementation, maintenance, and enhancement of a new, publicly available, web-based application for cataloging all known dietary supplement labels sold in the United States in a database tentatively called Dietary Supplements Label Database (DSLD). The goal of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit feedback from capable vendors that will help finalize the SOW.  

The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of both Government requirements and industry capabilities.  The pre-solicitation conference is to be used to 1) disseminate background data that offer further insight into the size and complexity of this acquisition, as well as the risks of undertaking this project, 2) clarify and inform the development of a detailed statement of work, and 3) discuss anticipated difficulties.  

A complete and comprehensive source of information containing virtually all dietary supplement labels does not currently exist. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) supplement label database is incomplete, as it contains only supplements reported by survey respondents.  The need for DSLD is apparent from numerous communications of stakeholders, from Congress, and deliberations within the ODS. It is hoped that an existing Federal database can be further developed so as to allow the research community and other interested stakeholders free access to dietary supplement label information.  

Such an application is needed as a resource both for research and educational purposes. The need for a complete, comprehensive, publicly available and readily accessible source of total label information and data is increasing as sales and use of dietary supplements grow (Radimer K et al, Am J Epi 160:339, 2004).  ODS believes that industry cooperation is essential to obtain complete coverage of all dietary supplements sold in the United States. 

The ultimate NIH goal is a DSLD containing label information for all products marketed and sold through all distribution channels in the United States. This would meet the research and informational needs of research investigators, health professionals, Federal and state agencies, and consumers. Researchers conducting epidemiological studies would find the dietary supplement database application useful in estimating total exposures to various dietary supplement ingredients and their associations with health outcomes. Researchers planning clinical trials require information on dietary supplement content for calculation of interventions involving them and in assessing and planning dietary intakes. Federal and state agencies need information on the content of dietary supplements to estimate current intakes and to plan nutritional interventions and recommendations. 

DSLD would also meet the needs of other segments of the dietary supplement community.  Dietitians would be able to obtain information on the composition of dietary supplement products for computing dietary intakes of nutrients or other bioactive constituents. Health professionals would be able to search for ingredients with beneficial or adverse effects. Industry might find product formulations or comparisons with competitive products of interest. Policy makers might find the application useful for calculating the contributions of various dietary supplements to total nutrient intakes. 

The immediate goal of this Request for Information is to identify capable vendors and solicit ideas on the development processes so as to inform the finalization of a Statement of Work.  An integral part of this work is understanding and defining both the technical components and processes and the project management components and processes. 

ODS anticipates a 12-month requirements (feasibility) development effort.  Requirements development should be approached by the vendor becoming familiar with other Federal research efforts in this area for the purposes of interfacing.  At its completion, ODS requires a report defining the feasibility of continuing this effort into its design phase and delivery of a prototype dietary supplements label database.  

It is important that the DSLD interface well with existing databases, especially the NHANES/ NCHS/CDC survey dietary supplement label database and the USDA/ARS standard reference database for food composition, in order to maximize the utility of the DSLD for the government, researchers, and the public. 

Contractors expressing an interest should provide appropriate capability statements.  The capability statement shall include the following: 
1) Description of the organization’s experience and past performance with large, complex databases for use in research
2) CV’s for key personnel, including the professional qualifications and specific experience of staff who may be assigned to the requirement.  
3) Description of the vendor’s ability to access labels and required information in order to populate the DSLD, including a sampling plan to demonstrate the ability to capture the full range of products in the marketplace. 
4) Sample content (both nutrient and non-nutrient) to be included in DSLD. 
5) Steps to ensure accuracy and quality of information in DSLD, including how to deal with complex issues such as a) capturing digital images of labels, b) methods to identify products with a unique number or code to facilitate product identification building on those already in use in other Federal databases, c) methods to distinguish among such factors as validation of quantification of true zeros, missing data, etc., d) methods for verifying the validity of information contained the sample labels, e) methods for converting the label information into units compatible with those in other Federal government databases, f) documentation of how changes in labels will be documented promptly in DSL D, g) documentation of likely challenges anticipated in developing DSLD, such as use of structured vocabulary or dictionary of synonyms, and h) methods for freezing data for archiving and reporting. 
6) Plan for producing a DSLD prototype at the conclusion of a forecasted 12-month requirements development effort.
7) Outline of how DSLD will integrate with the existing National Center for Health Statistics NCHS/NHANES Dietary Supplement Database and the USDA Standard Reference Food Composition Database.  
8) Detailed summary of the process to be used in requirements development.
9) Examples of user-interface design completed on projects of similar size and/or complexity.
10) Discussion of preferred programming code to be used during program code construction.
11) Discussion of effort and experience involved in system testing and quality assurance testing.
12) Copy of certified level of maturity, as it related to CMMI: Capability Maturity Model Integration
13) Names and numbers of three references from former clients involved in an effort of similar size and/or complexity including contract number, contract type, dollar value for each customer, reference and customer point of contact with phone number, and title of individual. 
14) Any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this Sources Sought Notice that would enhance NIH’s consideration and evaluation of the information submitted. 
15) Name and address of firm.
16) Type of business (i.e.: small business, small disadvantaged 8(a) certified, HUBZONE, woman-owned small business, small disadvantaged business (not 8(a) certified), veteran-owned small business, disabled veteran owned business, etc.)
17)  Point of contact: name, title, phone, fax and e-mail.
18)  DUNS number, NAICS codes 
19) A statement that the contractor has registered in the central contractor registration (ccr) data base (http://www.ccr.gov).

<DESC>NOTE:  RESPONSE DATE CHANGED TO OCTOBER 31, 2006

As part of its biodefense research mission, the Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  announces a program to support a systems biology analysis of innate and/or adaptive immune responses to infection, vaccination, or immunotherapy, with a focus on NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens (listed at http://www2.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm). Immunological research that is not directed specifically at one or more NIAID Category A, B, or C priority pathogen or their products is responsive only if the research: 1) addresses a practical approach to inducing, controlling or improving the effectiveness of innate and/or adaptive immune responses to infection by those pathogens or vaccines or immunotherapies to prevent them; and 2) includes validation studies with at least one NIAID Category A, B or C priority pathogen to confirm the importance of the immunological pathway in protection of the host from, or clearance of that pathogen. 

The goal of this program is to develop a more comprehensive knowledge of innate and adaptive immune responses to bacteria and viruses or host responses to vaccines and immunotherapeutics against these pathogens, using a systems biology approach.  Knowledge gained from these studies will advance our understanding of the delicate balance required to induce protective immunity against infectious agents, in particular NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens, without accompanying immune-mediated damage to the individual.

The systems biology analysis shall be based on high-throughput screens of existing or novel mouse models for identification of key regulatory immune response genes, supported by detailed genomics, proteomics, computational biology, and bioinformatics approaches to determine the gene products’ functions in innate and/or adaptive immunity to infection with, or vaccination or immunotherapy against, NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens. 

The systems biology analysis shall include:

(1) High-throughput screens of mouse models for identification of key regulatory immune response genes. Forward genetic approaches are preferred for the generation of novel mouse models or study of existing models, since genes can be identified in the absence of a detailed knowledge of the genetic regulation of an observed phenotype. Some recommended genetics approaches include random mutagenesis using ethylnitrosourea (ENU), or large-scale analysis of recombinant inbred strains or congenic animals.  More targeted high-throughput methods (e.g., high-throughput generation of targeted Knock-outs, Knock-ins, or deletion mutations) may be utilized with adequate justification of the benefits these approaches bring to large-scale identification of novel immune response genes; and 

(2) Human correlation studies for analysis of a subset of immune regulatory genes, identified in the mouse studies, in human cell or tissue samples. While human cell lines may be used in initial screens, results shall be validated in primary human cell lines or tissues.  The analyses shall be designed to determine whether the immune response genes identified in the mouse function similarly in human immune cells. 

This RFP will be available electronically on/about June 30, 2006, and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps and the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.     This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.     No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>Renewal of Service Contract on the Automation Maintenance on the Siemens System 600 Control System
EA133C-06-RQ-0615


The U. S. Department of Commerce, NOAA and the Center for Coastal Environmental Health Bimolecular Research Laboratory (CCEHBR), is issuing an intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with Control Management Inc for renewal of a service contract on the automation maintenance on the Siemens System 600 Controls System for the energy management system for all the HVAC and refrigeration sensors and proprietary software.  The Apogee/Siemens system licensed by CMI, Inc. is a proprietary Direct Digital Control (DDC) system for automated building controls, emergency notification and preventative maintenance.  It serves as the central nervous system of the CCEHBR laboratory facility and monitors and controls all critical operating environment parameters.  Any other system would result in redundant features, additional materials and loss of function and efficiency by not having an integral central system for the CCEHBR facility.  Currently, CMI is the original installer of the existing system and they are the warranty holder for all the Siemens/Apogee systems presently in the building, and site license for the existing energy management system proprietary software is also held by CMI.  By going to other contractors, the government would lose their existing warranties on our energy management system and emergency notification system.  This violation of the proprietary contract could have the government remove and install new control boards, circuit cards and software throughout the complete 38,000 square foot building at a cost prohibited expense.  Period of Performance will be September 1, 2006 through August 31, 2007, with four one-year options.  The NAICS code for this action is 238220 and the size standard is $12.0.  This requirement shall be 100% set aside for small business.  


The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source (statutory authority is 41 U.S.C.253(c) (1), Only One Responsible Source).  The company is:  Control Management Inc., 3101 Carlisle Street, Columbia, SC  29205.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to respond to this requirement by July 3, 2006.  Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.    Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Janie.m.laferty@noaa.gov. Note 22 applies

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Vacuum Chamber System SOLICITATION NO. NNG06160728L which was posted on June 16, 2006. You are notified that the following changes are made: This mofification is to address some Comments and Answers: 1. General:  There is no functional specification, that is, base pressure or pressure-time requirement, so we assume that this system is intended for normal, unbaked UHV, and that the workpiece (reaction wheel) in itself is not sufficiently gassy to prevent achievement of low pressures.  Our normal materials would be type 304ss, bead blast interior finish unless otherwise specified. Reply:	The system is for normal UHV.  The reaction wheel does outgas slightly, but will not prevent the system from reaching low pressures.  This material listed is acceptable but not required. 2.  General:  We also assume that the workplace is insensitive to magnetic fields, such as those from the ion pump, or welds, and requires no specialized shielding. Reply:	The reaction wheel is insensitive to the magnetic fields from the ion pump and welds. 3.  Chamber:  The top flange (described as "blanket", a typo, "blanked" is to be centrally-located? Reply:	There was a typo in the chamber description.  The top flange should be "blanked".  It is not required to be centrally located. 4.  Chamber: Handles.  this chamber is relatively heavy.  Shall we also add hoisting points? Reply:	Hoisting points are acceptable but not required. 5.  Base plate: Again, assume that the 8" pump port is in the center, and that the mounting plate for the workpiece is likely also central, typically on standoff? Reply:	The mounting plate for the reaction wheel whould be centered in the chamber.  The mounting plate must not prohibit flow from the reaction wheel to the ion pump.	This may be achieved with standoffs.  It is acceptable for the port for the ion pump to be centered, but it is not required. 6.  Base plate: Gauge port.  For two sets of gauges, one "T" isn't going to be sufficient.  How about two separate 2.75" CFF for these? Reply:	Two spearate 2.75" CFF for the gauges is acceptable.  If that design is proposed, the total number of 2.75" CFF for the chamber must be increased by one.  A "T" leading to two more "T's" is also acceptable. 7.  Base plate:  Gauge locations.  At UHV, it would be more usual to have nude ion gauges extended directly into the vacuum chamber.  Instead of tube-type around a "corner" unless best accuracy is not required, or lowest pressures are not required.  Either way is fine with us. Reply:	Best accuracy is not required.	Lowest pressures are not required.  Gauge locations as described are preferred. 8.  Base plate: BNC flange.  Do you perhaps mean female, both sides? Reply:	Yes, this should be BNC female both sides. 9.  Base plate: "D" connectors.  Are internal connectors/cables needed? Reply:	Internal cables are not needed.  The only connectors required are those that provide access across the 6" CF as described.  Connectors of the same size should be of the opposite gender to prevent potential mismating. 10.  Gauges:  The specified brand and model of gauge does not operate ion(BA) gauge types.	It operates a cold cathode (CC) gauge; however, there is a CC sensor version good to 10EE-10 Torr.  The MM 200 operates ion gauges.  We strongly suggest ion gauges for long-term accuracy. Reply:	Based on the input, the specific gauge controller in the description does not have to be used.  Convection gauges and ion gauges are required per the description. 11.  Gate valve:  We assume metal face seal in this application unless told otherwise. Reply:	The gate valve seal should be appropriate for this application. 12.  Control panel:  since all valves are manual, and this type of system is generally cycled infrequently, a control system per se is not needed, and no interlocks or alarms are specified, however, your local requirements may demand an EMO (emergency off button) or even two and possibly some sort of alarm based on test interruption, etc. Reply:	Automatic shut-off is required as described.  Emergency off buttons are not required. 13.  Roughing pump:  This is not specified at all.  We are to assume that this is going to be a customer - side addition?  If so, do we provide interlocks and controls?  A mounting location? Reply:	The roughing pump is customer supplied.  The hardware is already on hand to connect it to the system as the system is described. 14.  Ion pump:	Arrangement and compatibility.	The equivalent to a 300 1/s pump with internal TSP is the Varian Vac Ion Plus Combination pump on an 8" CFF.	Its (ion part only)  speed is 300 l/s only in the diode version.  In order to ensure compatibility with your existing PE controller and pump, we need to know if you have a diode or triode arrangement and that you are really asking for a TSP built into the pump body.	Other, possibly more economical options are available if the TSP is separate from the pump, for example, in the chamber. Reply:	The TSP is to be built into the pump.  Our existing system has a diode arrangement. The due date for responses  is not extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.

<DESC>The notice that was published on 6/29/2006 is amended to include clarifying information about the nature of the unique qualifications of Mr. James Steed, who is viewed as the only source for meeting the Government's requirement. Mr. Steed, who is a Certified Business Continuity Professional (CBCP), is actively involved in CSVD’s disaster recovery functions for the BCC and provides facility support for the BCC Continuity of Operations (COOP) effort. Mr. Steed’s specific expertise and knowledge of the BCC’s electrical and mechanical infrastructure design and operation; knowledge of the BCC data center operational requirements; knowledge of the program area requirements, and his disaster recovery/contingency certification support this request. Mr. Steed has a thorough understanding of both the data center requirements and the facility management requirements at the BCC.  The Government believes that CBCP certification and specific experience with BCC COOP planning is essential to its requirement in order to obtain well-informed viewpoints, advice, and recommendations that are likely to be viewed as credible and worthy of consideration in decisionmaking.  The Government's requirement entails building upon and bringing to fruition ongoing, time-sensitive work and activity that is critical to achieving BCC's strategic objectives.  Mr. Steed was instrumental in conceptualizing, developing, and performing much of this work.  The Government believes that the success of this work is dependent on Mr. Steed's continued involvement because any other source would necessitate extensive relearning, duplication of effort, unacceptable delays, and excessive costs, and would jeopardize BCC's ability to meet its strategic goals.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the supplies and services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 14 calendar days from the date of this synopsis. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS), Sioux Falls, South Dakota, has a requirement for enhancements to ENVI 4.2 software, developed by Research Systems, Inc., currently running on dedicated Sun Solaris system, the result to be an ENVI-integrated, menu/GUI-based application for production of mosaic Landsat scenes.  Mosaic production capability must be capable of handling an initial data volume of approximately1050 Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) scenes, a data volume approaching one (1) terabyte.  All enhancements must be 100% compatible and fully interoperate with the existing USGS IADD system running Sun Solaris Version 9.0 and ENVI Version 4.2.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(l), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the specified supplies and services as a sole source procurement from Research Systems, Inc., 4990 Pearl East Circle, Boulder, Colorado, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required supplies and services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>Seeking sources with which to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for commercial dry cleaning services for a USAF maintenance facility.  Services required by this BPA include: 
1. Provision of highly absorbent fabric shop towels and rags, and oil-only absorbent pads, cloths, mats, etc.; 
2. Delivery / pick up. Absorbent towels and pads will be delivered in contractor owned, clean, locking ring 55-gallon drums; and 
3. Dry cleaning.

A Statement of Need will be made available to all interested parties upon request.  

Contractor should be aware that as part of this BPA the dry cleaning methodology utilized by the vendor must meet specific environmental criteria as outlined:

1. The dry cleaning methodology must be a  “closed-loop distillation” dry cleaning process that removes organic contaminants from used absorbent materials and processes them for commercial resale, or reuse.  

2. The “distillation” process must recycle the absorbent materials utilizing a dry cleaning process that uses solvents that are less toxic (e.g. mineral spirits) than the standard dry cleaning agent perchlorethylene or any other EPA-17 chemicals.  

3. Fluids extracted from the used absorbents shall be processed through a distillery that captures all of the fluid components that are recycled onsite and reused or made into new commercially salable products.  No distilled fluids shall be manifested as hazardous waste or transported from the facility as solid waste.  Fluids recycled shall go back into the dry cleaning process.

4. No absorbent materials shall be manifested as hazardous waste or transported from the facility as waste for any reason, nor disposed of as solid waste.   The contractor shall not transfer the contaminants from the absorbent to another media, as would result from water-based laundering; rather, the Contractor shall fully recycle the used absorbents. 

5.  Cleaned absorbent materials shall only be resold, reused or shredded and used to make new products, or sent to a manufacturer that uses the shredded materials for other absorbent products (e.g. absorbent booms).

<DESC>TSA seeks to identify sources capable of developing an agent-based risk management analysis tool at no–cost to the Government. This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources-sought synopsis only. The purpose of this sources-sought synopsis is to identify interested qualified sources that can provide a solution to the Government’s stated needs and requirements.  The required agent-based risk management tool shall facilitate an objective, methodical and systematic analysis of risk reduction efforts across commercial aviation.  A qualified source must be capable of providing software development services as set forth herein.   
1. Overview: the agent-based risk management analysis tool envisioned is an analytic process and simulation model designed to process data developed by government/industry subject matter experts to identify domestic commercial aviation vulnerabilities at various boundary points such as commercial aviation airports, the aviation system's infrastructure, and aircraft. The tool will measure the effectiveness and efficiency of potential future countermeasure suites as measured by risk reduction and begin to approximate impact on the commercial aviation system. Tool outputs will provide an additional stream of security/vulnerability related data that complements red teaming, TSA-led on-site airport assessments and other existing security information gathering and/or assessment vehicles. 
The agent-based risk management analysis tool will utilize red (i.e., terrorists) and blue (i.e., law enforcement officers, transportation security officers, etc.) to simulate the effectiveness of baseline security measures in the commercial aviation environment.  The agents will be assigned rule-bases or scripts and the interactions between these agents will facilitate the identification of vulnerabilities.
Subsequent analyses will assess potential countermeasures, and approximate their total risk reduction by extrapolating impact on domestic commercial aviation operations and economics. Analysts will select combinations of promising countermeasures for sequential analysis and determination of the most effective and efficient sequence of defensive actions.
2. Tool Requirements: The following describes requirements for this project. 

A . Access to the Tool During and After Development.  The contractor will share the tool with TSA by execution of a license agreement.  Permission for the contractor to license or sell  the tool to third-parties will be considered pending review for Sensitive Security Information and classified data.
B. Analyses. The contractor will assist TSA in developing analyses using the tool on an as-needed basis.  
C. Tool Modification and Maintenance Support.  The contractor shall modify and test the system as directed by TSA.  The contractor shall fix and test tool problems, bugs or other errors.  The contractor must provide support for tool upgrades and modifications.  The tool should be built so that it can be scalable to other modes of transportation, although adapting the tool to other transportation modes will not be a requirement of this project. 
D. Training.  The contractor shall provide training services for TSA users, as required, at no cost to the Government.
E. Cost/Price.  The contractor shall bear its own costs for development of the tool and related activities described herein.  The Government will not be liable for any costs, fees or expenses incurred in this effort. 

3.  Submittal requirements: Interested parties should provide relevant past experience demonstrating experience in development of agent-based risk management analysis tools, aviation security, and support of and new development of similar type risk assessment applications.  Respondents are encouraged to provide other information that demonstrates their capability to perform this work. The information requested in this sources-sought synopsis shall not exceed five pages.  Responses to this notice must include entity name, address, DUNS number, name of contact person, contact person’s telephone number and contact person’s e-mail address.

This is not a request for proposals and nothing in this sources sought synopsis constitutes nor shall be construed to be an obligation of the Government of an expenditure of funds or to make award of a contract. Responses to this notice must be by electronic mail addressed to benjamin.vanwormer@dhs.gov. Responses must be time stamped by the receiving DHS server not later than 11:59 p.m., Eastern Daylight Savings Time, July 13, 2006. Responses by any other means will not be accepted.

A contract shall be issued for (S)AKTA Explorer 100 System.  Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to the fact that GE Healthcare is the only company which makes FPLC Chromatographic System. This system is a re-design of the classic Pharmcia FPLC instrument and offers two times the maximum flow rate, the gold standard in protein purification for over 20 years.  Note 22 applies herein.  The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1):  FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will be considered solely for informational purposes.  This procurement is not set-aside for small business.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Spectrometer with high ratio diluter
<DESC>In accordance with FAR subpart 13.106(b) (1), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue, on a sole source basis, a purchase order to Cambustion LTD in Cambridge, UK in the amount of $89,922.00 for an Aerosol particle sizer with a high ratio diluter and one day function check and training visit.   CDC believes that Cambustion LTD is the only organization that can meet the requirements of the order because the Cambustion instrument uses a (patented) hardware solution to the problem of image charge effects. This is preferable over that of a software solution used by the TSI instruments. At high transient aerosol concentrations, artifacts are likely to be observed with the TSI instruments producing erroneous results. Additionally, the dimensions of the TSI FMPS and EEPS are too large for convenience for field applications, where space is at a premium. Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their abilities to meet this requirement.  The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please send your documentation to Ronnie Francis at the office identified above, by fax (770) 488-2688 or by e-mail to efi8@cdc.gov.  Documentation should be received within fifteen (15) days after date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by CDC.

<SUBJECT>Emerging Systems and Technologies
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC SD) is tasked with identifying and exploring emerging C4ISR technologies to enhance the performance of diverse systems for their military or intelligence utility. This includes evaluation of current state of the art technologies and research, prototype development, and integration of new technologies.  The proposed contract action is for 1 base year (12 months) and 2 one-year options.  The intended contract number is N66001-06-D-0114.  The total estimated amount of this action is NTE $3 Million, including Options. The Government intends to award a sole-source cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract to AUSGAR Technologies for this effort. This support is urgently needed to continue certification and support of the Emerging Systems and Technologies (EST) project.  This is a one-time procurement, with no anticipated follow-on effort required. AUSGAR, a Small Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), is uniquely qualified to perform this effort. AUSGAR is uniquely qualified in the integration and test of technology for the EST project, and has previously supported the initial development of documents necessary for the DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP) and DISN Security Accreditation Working Group (DSA WG) SABI CDS approval process.  AUSGAR has the necessary expertise to support the necessary efforts of this requested action that includes NSA Information System Security Engineering Professional (NSA ISSEP), NSA Information Security Professional, Microsoft Certified Personnel, CISCO Certified Professional and Certified Information System Security Professionals (CISSP)-certified engineers.  AUSGAR has unique expertise and knowledge in supporting integration and interoperability for shore and afloat experimental initiatives and Fleet modeling and simulation programs, and in providing assessment, testing and evaluation of emerging C4ISR systems and related technologies as they apply to operational utility, including getting Secret and Below Interoperability (SABI) Cross Domain Solution (CDS) approvals for wired and wireless environments. AUSGAR has been supporting SSCSD in the integration/test of software and integrating hardware in order to integrate emerging systems and technology into fleet/joint capability.  Support from AUSGAR based on prior extensive Joint program experience, DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP) and DISN Security Accreditation Working Group (DSA WG) SABI CDS approval process, demonstrated experience in Navy Laboratory C4ISR, and unique experience in advanced C4ISR technologies meets the time-critical requirements of EST. Questions concerning this effort should be addressed to madelynn.whittington@navy.mil (619)553-0928.

<SUBJECT>R -- National Donor Recognition Cermony and Workshop (NDRCW)
<DESC>The Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA intends to negotiate- on a sole source basis—with National Kidney Foundation(NKF) of New York, National Donor Family Council(NDFC), New York.  The purpose of this requirement is to assist the Division of Transplantation (DoT), Health Systems Bureau with the planning and implementation of meeting services and activities related to the tenth National Donor Recognition Ceremony and Workshops. Because the National Organ Transplant Act protects the confidentiality of donors, the Government has no access to the identities of the Nation’s donors and no contact information for them. It is critical therefore for NKF to assist the Division of Transplantation (DoT) with the implementation of the 2007 NDRCW to have access to the identity of and contact information for organ and tissue donor families across the country in order to provide them information about, and registration information for, the event. Especially because many of the attending families tend to be fairly early in their grief process, the contractor also must have considerable experience in working with donor families, living donors, and recipients, and understanding their special needs. Any other source would have to duplicate a substantial array of current and previous efforts to accomplish the same objectives if the law allowed access to donor information. This would cause substantial duplication of cost, which would not be expected to be recovered through competition. Therefore, NK/NDFC is determined to be the only responsible source under the authority found in 41 USC 253(i), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a) (2). This is not a solicitation, but a notification of our intent to contract. A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file.   See Note 22

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) has a requirement for a combined Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite signal generator and GPS jammer/spoofer signal simulator for testing GPS receivers and receiver/antenna combinations to evaluate the receiver anti-jam/anti-spoofer performance in realistic signal environments.  

Two (2) testing configurations are envisioned.  Configuration 1 uses a direct injection set-up, in which a composite GPS signal comprised of a satellite-jammer-receiver scenario is connected directly into the GPS receiver, by-passing the antenna.  This set-up will exercise the internal receiver signal processing functions which have been designed to work in stressing signal environments.  Configuration 2 will incorporate individual signal generator outputs for multiple satellites and multiple jammer signals radiated from various locations into an anechoic chamber.  This configuration will spatially simulate a satellite constellation and jammer scenario in which a GPS receiver is located and connected to a Controlled Radiation Pattern Antenna (CRPA) type of antenna. This set-up will not only exercise the receiver internal anti-jam processing, but also the anti-jam capability of the antenna. This configuration will also require, as outputs from the GPS signal simulator, control signals which can be integrated to a rate table on which the CRPA antenna is mounted … to simulate attitude changes of the simulated vehicle platform.  Both configurations will require signal selection of L1/L2/L5 frequencies.  Code selections of C/A, L2C, P, and P(Y) codes are required, as well as Y-Code (Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM)) and M-Code which includes (M-noise, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) M-code, and M-code-data sets). 

Sole source negotiations will be held with Spirent Federal Systems, Inc. (Spirent).  Spirent developed a GPS simulator which became the industry leader in this technical area.  Spirent also provides unique capabilities and experience from its sales of multiple units to DoD Laboratories.  Contract period of performance is estimated to be sixteen (16) weeks.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a contract to Xenogen Corporation, 860 Atlantic Avenue, Alamada, California  94501.  A contract shall be issued for the IVIS Imaging System 200 Series.  Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to the fact that Xenogen is the only company which makes in  vivo biophotonic imaging technology that allows real-time visual exploration and analysis of gene expression, cellular pathways, and drug/target interactions in the physiological context of the living animal.  Additionally, IVIS system from Xenogen is cost effective and can be kept in a procedure room in animal house without vibrating the floor.  Note 22 applies herein.  The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1):  FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will be considered solely for informational purposes.  This procurement is not set-aside for small business.

<SUBJECT>D -- Telecommunications Services
<DESC>The General Services Administration intends to extend on sole source basis three contracts, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, to provide continuity of service and support the transition to a new competitive award currently being worked for Region 1 local services.  Request for proposal was posted on the Fedbizopps on June 14, 2006.   The region currently has three contracts for local telecommunications services which were awarded to Verizon and Southern Bell Company(DBA AT&T) to support services in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont.  The contracts were originally awarded in 2001 and are due to expire in July 2006.  The region is currently competing a regional local services contract to consolidate all current local telecommunication services throughout the six (6) New England states.

Current contracts:

1.	Contract GS01K01BKM0050 was awarded to Verizon on January 26, 2001 to support services in Worcester, Massachusetts, Manchester, Laconia, Concord and Portsmouth, New Hampshire and Montpelier and Burlington, Vermont.  The contract period of performance ended on January 25, 2006 and was extended six months in order to compete the new Region 1 Local Services Contract.  

2.	Contract GS01K01BKM0049 was awarded to Verizon on February 29, 2001 to support services in Augusta, Bangor and Portland, Maine.  The contract period of performance ended on February 28, 2006 and was extended six months in order to compete the new Region 1 Local Services Contract.  

3.	Contract GS01K01BKM0048 was awarded to Southern Bell Company (AT&T) on January 26, 2001 to support services in the state of Connecticut.  The contract period of performance ended on January 25, 2006 and was extended six months in order to compete the new Region 1 Local Services Contract.  


As the incumbent contractors, Verizon and Southern Bell Company(AT&T), are the sole contractors capable of providing continuity of services through the period leading to a follow-on effort without major disruption, loss of functionality and/or features, degradation of services and significant overall cost impact to the federal agencies serviced by this contract.  This action effects approximately 6,000 circuits.  

A lapse in service will have an immediate detrimental effect on the ability of the General Services Administration to provide telecommunications services to federal agencies in the New England region.  Approximately 125 Government agencies in the New England region would lose telecommunications service if these contracts ended before the services could be transitioned to the new Local Services Contract. This contract extension will provide a bridge while a competitive acquisition is finalized and services can be transitioned to the new contract.  

This sole source contract modification extension is to allow sufficient time to transition to the Region 1 Local Services Contract.  Services will be mirrored on the three bridge awards to provide for transition to the Local Services Contract.

The Statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (d)(1)(B).

The current contracts expire on/or around July 31, 2006.  The proposed Bridge contract extensions period of performance will be from  August 2006  to August 2007.  The twelve month Bridge contract extensions will continue to provide the minimum services that are currently provided for the requiring agencies.

(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.  (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.  (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally.

However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations.

If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. An offeror within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://www.dnb.com. An offeror located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number.  (k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation.

(End of provision)  52.212-2   	EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS  (JAN 1999) (a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each Offeror's submission is evaluated according to the factors shown below.  Factors A, B, and C are roughly equal to each other; factor D is less important.    A)	Compliance with solicitation requirement B)	Product Availability  C)	Delivery Schedule  D)	Price Contract award shall be made to the responsible vendor whose offer, in conforming to this RFQ, provides an overall best value to the Government, technical evaluation factors, and cost considered.  The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objectives, with a realistic and reasonable cost.  Technical evaluation factors are more important than cost; however, between quotes that are evaluated as technically equal in quality, cost will become a major consideration in selecting the successful vendor A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful vendor within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.  (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined commercial synopsis/solicitation (solicitation #HSFEEM-06-Q-0041), supplemented with additional information included herein.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation for quotes, since a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U. S. Fire Administration (USFA), National Emergency Training Center (NETC) has a requirement for provision of a web-based platform for administering and scoring multi-rater assessment instruments commonly referred to as “360° assessments.”  This requirement will be set aside 100% for small business.  The NAICS code is 518210, Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services, and the small business size standard is $23 million [average annual receipts for three preceding fiscal years].  Award of a firm-fixed-price commercial purchase order, using simplified acquisition procedures, is anticipated.  All questions pertaining to this solicitation must be submitted to teresa.dingle@dhs.gov, in writing no later than July 10, 2006.  Quotation packages shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, National Emergency Training Center, NETC Acquisition Section, E114B, 16825 S. Seton Avenue, Emmitsburg, MD 21727 or emailed to teresa.dingle@dhs.gov, no later than 4:00 p.m., July 21, 2006.  DHS/USFA sponsors and supports a resident, executive education program at the National Fire Academy (NFA), National Emergency Training Center, Emmitsburg, Maryland, entitled the Executive Fire Officer Program (EFOP).  One of the main objectives of EFOP is to develop the leadership capacity of its participants or students (hereafter referred to as “subjects”), who are either senior fire executives or other individuals in key positions from fire and emergency services organizations.  The subjects are not employees of DHS/USFA, but are representatives or employees of emergency services organizations from all over the United States of America.  EFOP is a 4-year program, consisting of four 2-week courses in residence.  Each year also requires the completion of an applied research project as a post-course activity.  Both the courses and the research projects are developed academically to position the EFOP as a graduate-level program.  At any given time, there are approximately 800 participants within the EFOP, with an average of 200 enrolled at each of the four tiers or courses of the program.  Two of the courses would feature 360° instruments with feedback.  Since 1987, USFA has purchased and included copyrighted or proprietary psychological assessment instrumentation and scoring services within EFOP courses.  The instrumentation has been previously purchased each year, and as used, has provided feedback information to EFOP participants regarding their leadership effectiveness and other related skill areas.  This information has been supportive to a basic premise established within USFA’s approach to leadership development: self-awareness is critical for making changes to facilitate personal development and growth.  Some of the instruments previously used are self-assessment in nature, whereby others are multi-rater (multi-rater is defined as an instrument which contains both a self-assessment rating and other observer ratings, such as subordinates, peers, and/or superiors). The advantage of using a multi-rater instrument enables the participant to receive feedback that results in a perceived comparison between self and others.  This specific procurement shall result in the contractor providing to the government a web-based multi-rater (feedback and assessment) platform in which USFA can feature their selected assessment instruments for administration, scoring, and feedback report generation for subjects.  The contractor shall host the software on the contractor’s website. The contractor shall provide a web-based multi-rater assessment platform (360°) that will facilitate the administration, completion, and scoring of assessment instruments.  The product will be hereafter referred to as “platform” for purposes of this procurement.  The platform shall be totally (100%) web-based and accessible to any subject and their raters who have internet access.  The scales and rating elements that the product measure shall be capable of being reconfigured and the reconfiguration shall enable to government to create its own assessment rating areas.  The platform shall feature the ability to generate and send personalized reminders (for assessment instrument completion) to both subjects and their raters.  The platform shall contain report generation capability for the scoring and production of participant feedback reports.  The platform shall contain automatic step-by-step reminders to ensure that appraisals are maintained according to completion schedules.  The platform shall have a “save and resume function” so that participants and their observing raters may complete the instrument over a period of time.  The platform shall demonstrate and contain an intuitive user interface, making it easy and simple for participants and their raters to complete the assessment regardless of the rating elements.  The software shall offer security to the government, the subjects, and the raters (including preservation of the rater’s identity).  Appropriate security to restrict access to the platform shall be provided.  The platform area purchased by the government shall be capable of customization, to include use of the government’s name, seal/logo and identity.  The platform shall feature and include project management capabilities to enable the government’s administrator(s) to prepare, monitor, and score the assessments, and to subsequently print feedback reports.  The platform product must meet the requirements established within Section 508 (Americans with Disabilities Act [ADA]) for the completion of the questionnaire form component.  If the platform does not comply with Section 508, the contractor shall make a statement to that effect in the quotation package.  The platform, once purchased by the government, shall contain a license for indefinite use (in perpetuity) without any additional fees or charges.  It is recognized by the government that the license is separate from and does not include any charges for web-hosting or annual maintenance fee(s).  The government desires to purchase assessment services on a per annum basis for 500 participants.  It should be noted that these subjects are individual assessments and will not be repeated within the same year.  The contractor shall host the platform for a minimum period of one year.  The contractor shall provide pricing for hosting of the platform on its web-site on a per annum basis, for four option years beyond the base period of one year.  The government is not obligated to exercise any of the option years.

Assessment of the Accuracy of the Troponin Assay in the Diagnosis of Myocardial Infarction and How Gender Influences MI Diagnosis and Treatment

Introduction

We are seeking some clinical data in order to perform an observational study to assess the accuracy of the troponin assay in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) and how gender influences MI diagnosis and treatment. 

Background

a) Accuracy of Troponin Assays

Cardiac troponins are highly sensitive and specific biochemical markers of myocardial cell necrosis and are widely used for the diagnosis of MI.1, 2 Troponin levels rise and fall with MI and with other clinical syndromes associated with infiltrative/inflammatory causes of myocyte death. There are inaccuracies associated with troponin assays as currently used in clinical practice which may result in false-positive and false-negative test results. 

The results of different troponin assays are not generally comparable. The analytical variability among troponin assays is due to the fact that different troponin assays have wide variations in lower detection limits, upper reference limits, diagnostic cut points, assay imprecision (coefficient of variation),3 and specimen matrices (i.e., serum versus plasma samples). The presence of a large number of manufacturers of troponin assays in the United States market makes standardization difficult.

b) Gender Issues

Cardiovascular diseases comprise the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States.4 Gender differences exist among patients with coronary artery disease. The presentation, prognosis, and mortality of the disease are different in men and women. There are disparities in diagnosis and treatment between genders as well. 

Most of the clinical research regarding the diagnosis and management of coronary heart disease is performed in predominantly male populations. The issue of variation in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of ACS by gender is complex. On the one hand, women presenting with symptoms of ACS tend to have a higher frequency of angiographically normal coronary arteries than men5-10. This may explain why some studies of ACS demonstrate that women tend to have less severe disease and a better prognosis than men11. This in turn may be due to the fact that a greater percentage of women who present with symptoms of cardiac ischemia may have a non-cardiac disease as the basis for those symptoms. 

On the other hand, most ACS trials show women to have higher morbidity and mortality than men although this difference is usually narrowed or eliminated when outcome is controlled for various confounding variables such as age, diabetes, and heart failure12. If women are really at greater risk for worse outcomes associated with ACS than are men, one explanation for this may be that they tend to be treated less aggressively than men even when more aggressive treatment is warranted.   

Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is: 1) to assess the accuracy and positive and negative predictive values of the troponin assay in the diagnosis of MI, and 2) to assess how the diagnosis and treatment of MI vary by gender. The secondary objective of the study is to assess whether the accuracy and predictive values of troponin assays vary by gender.  

Data Source Requirements

We will conduct an observational study to investigate the stated objectives. The data may be collected retrospectively or prospectively.

The study population consists of male and female patients at medical facilities who are evaluated and treated, if indicated, for MI. The source of data may be from a health care facility or a registry. In either case, the data must be in an electronic format for ease of accessibility and data extraction. The data will include the following elements:

•	Demographic data: age, race, and gender
•	Troponin test results
•	Type of troponin assays performed 
•	Other clinical data relevant to the diagnosis of MI
•	Admission and discharge diagnoses
•	Coronary artery disease related treatments
•	Other co-morbidities related to the elevation of troponin in the absence of an MI
 
We will need records on at least 31,000 patients with a diagnosis of MI and at least 2,000 to 16,000 patients who are evaluated for MI and are found not to have had an MI. Only patients who have received a troponin test can be included in this study.
 
Firm Fixed Price – Not to Exceed $30,000

We have received funding from the FDA Office of Women’s Health in the amount of $30,000 which will be solely appropriated for the purchase of the data and the performance of the data analyses. This is the only funding available for this project. 

Evaluation Criteria

1.	An electronic database from a health care facility or a registry
2.	The number of records that include clinical data from a population consisting of male and female patients at medical facilities who are evaluated and treated, if indicated, for MI, and with the required data elements.
3.	Supplying the raw data to the investigators will be considered very favorably. 
4.	However, if the data owner does not release the raw data to FDA, it should provide the statistical analyses based on a detailed plan from the investigators including, but not limited to: 
•	From the above mentioned data, MI status of each patient will be determined. There will be three categories for MI classification based on the MI definitions: definite, probable, and negative. (We will supply the specific diagnostic criteria for each category.)
•	Age-, race-, and gender-specific calculations will be performed for the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of troponin assay in the diagnosis of MI.  
•	The effect of gender for the likelihood of receiving a discharge diagnosis of MI and the likelihood of receiving treatment for MI will be assessed.   
5.	The projected time line for the study is approximately one year. This means that the contractor should demonstrate the capability of either providing the raw data to the FDA within six months of the receipt of funding or completing the final study analyses within eight months of the receipt of funding.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ATF has a requirement for a Blanket Purchase Agreements BPA covering a five year period that will be available for publication of legal advertisements for the purpose of announcing property seizures. ATF is mandated by law to publish all property that is seized for forfeiture. This has been further defined as Notice of the seizure of property and the intent to forfeit must be published once a week for three successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the judicial district in which the proceeding is brought. Other printed media such as periodicals, magazines and books are not acceptable. The purpose of these advertisements is to give notice to all parties who may have a vested interest in the seized property who have not already been noticed. ATF currently has an extended need to publish all property seized for forfeiture in the Kentucky, Western Federal Judicial District.  The Contractor shall publish the legal advertisements in a newspaper of general circulation.  That is, a newspaper that publishes news of general interest and character to the public, to include political and business events, circulating among the general public in Breckenridge, Bullitt, Hardin, Jefferson, Larue, Marion, Meade, Nelson, Oldham, Spencer and Washington Counties, Kentucky.  The advertisement shall include at minimum specific descriptive information regarding the property and its seizure by ATF.  In addition the advertisement will include instructions as to how parties with an interest in the property seized can file a claim to contest the seizure and intended forfeiture of the property. In the Kentucky, more than one Federal judicial district is located within the state.  Counties comprised in the Western Federal Judicial district are given in United States Code 28 U.S.C. 124 b.  Breckenridge, Bullitt, Hardin, Jefferson, Larue, Marion, Meade, Nelson, Oldham, Spencer and Washington Counties, Kentucky within the Western Federal Judicial District is the area that needs to be covered in this advertising requirement. To demonstrate publishing of substantial quantities offerors must show that they have at least a paid circulation of 2,500 or more copies or have at least one newspaper in circulation by subscription per 4,000 people in that judicial district and specifically in Breckinridge, Bullitt, Hardin, Jefferson, Larue, Marion, Meade, Nelson, Oldham, Spencer and Washington Counties, Kentucky. The Contractor shall publish the advertisements in a newspaper, which has a circulation of substantial quantities in the judicial district and counties set forth above.  The Contractor shall furnish evidence that it publishes a newspaper of general circulation in the judicial district and counties.  Substantial quantities excludes distribution of unsolicited copies. Based upon historical use and expected future requirements, ATF estimates the volume of seized property advertisements in between 4,000 and 15,000 lines per 12-month period over the next 60 months. The Contractor shall accept from the ATF, Asset Forfeiture and Seized Property Branch, 5 working days prior to publication, the text for ad publication i.e. Monday submission for next Monday publication. Typically, ATF will transmit data to the Contractor via electronic transmission.  The preferred method is via Internet e-mail as a word processing attachment.  The ATF may transmit the data manually (via fax or by disk) to the Contractor. Each advertisement shall be placed in sufficient time in order to be published on a specified date.  The advertisements shall be published at 1 week intervals.  The newspaper shall use the smallest font available.  The Contractor shall provide the Asset Forfeiture Office at ATF draft copies of each new weekly advertisement.  The Asset Forfeiture Office will examine the data for accuracy and layout before publication of the advertisement.  Asset Forfeiture will inspect services and accept or reject the ad within 3 days of receipt.  The draft must specify the font size and the cost of the advertisement.  After publication the Contractor shall also provide copies of the actual ad so Asset Forfeiture may verify the ad was published.

The Government shall not be obligated to pay the contractor any amount in excess of the NTE ceiling price in the schedule, unless and until the contracting officer shall have notified the contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and shall have specified in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract.

12.	REPLACEMENT/REPAIR PARTS:  All costs associated with scheduled preventive maintenance shall be included in PM costs.  However, all costs discovered during scheduled preventive maintenance but not regarded as scheduled preventive maintenance may be reimbursed under the unscheduled parts and labor line items.  All costs for parts, which result in less than $5.00 per “total quantity”, shall be included in the labor rate charge for unscheduled maintenance and service calls.  Parts less than $5.00 total quantity shall not be charged or reimbursed separately.  For this purpose, “total quantity” shall refer to the aggregate quantity for same group of similar items.  For example:

5 nuts and 5 bolts at $0.05 each are considered a total quantity of 10.  Total quantity 10 nuts/bolts x $0.05 = $0.50 which shall not be charged or reimbursed separately.

5 quarts of lubricant/oil at $1.50/quart.  Total quantity is 5 quarts x $1.50/quart=$7.50 which can be charged in full under line item for parts.

Cost for replacement parts will be no greater than that charged the contractor’s commercial customer and shall be billed at actual cost plus the predetermined percentage listed on the contract line items.  Replacement parts shall be itemized and billed as separate items on the contractor’s invoice.   A copy of the contractor’s purchase invoice for individual replacement parts exceeding $100 shall accompany the contractor’s invoice to the Government.


All freight cost associated with the shipment of parts for unscheduled service calls will be reimbursed by the Federal Government.  Freight costs may be included with the cost of the parts or as a separate item.  In either case, the costs will be paid under the line items for repair parts for equipment.  If other than normal expediency and mode of transportation, the contractor shall obtain the authorized approval signature of the Store Director or designated representative on the service/work order ticket approving such shipment.  Unless otherwise directed by the Store Director or designated representative, the contractor shall have the part shipped by the most cost efficient method.

The contractor shall furnish to the Store Director or designated representative for his/her inspection and disposal, any parts removed for replacement during repair.

13.	TRIP CHARGES:  A trip charge is defined as the cost of transportation from the contractor’s place of business, to the commissary, and return.

The contractor shall, without additional effort by or cost to the Government, maintain and acquire all permits in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.  The contractor is responsible for complying with local, state, and federal regulations concerning use, removal, transportation, handling, and disposal (off the installation) of oil, parts, or other hazardous waste items resulting from the performance of this contract.  The Government will assume no liability or responsibility for the contractor’s compliance or noncompliance with such responsibilities.  The Government shall reimburse environmental fees imposed on the contractor for performance of services for unscheduled service calls only.  Environmental fees for preventive maintenance shall be included in the PM cost. The contractor shall list all environmental fees as a separate item on the invoicing 

15.	CONTRACTOR CALLBACK:  Monitoring of scheduled preventive maintenance and unscheduled service calls and repair parts will be accomplished on a 100% inspection basis immediately after completion (this will normally be within one day of use).  When the Store Director or designated representative determines the doors do not operate as intended, the contractor will be notified.  This shall be considered a callback and the service and trip charge shall be at the contractor’s expense, unless it is determined that the call back is due to a problem other than the initial service call.  Response time for call back service shall be a maximum of eight (8) hours from the time the Store Director or designated representative contacts the contractor of the problem.

16.	SERVICE TICKET:  The contractor will furnish to the Store Director or designated representative a prepared service ticket every time scheduled preventive maintenance or unscheduled repair is provided. A signature of the Store Director or designated representative shall validate the service described on the ticket.  Service tickets shall list all work performed; the make, model, location and serial number of the door(s); and all parts used for each type of door.  The service ticket must also include date and time the contractor began and completed service, along with the total hours needed to perform the required maintenance and applicable labor rates as specified in the Schedule of Supplies and Services.

Answer:  The capacity refers to how many standard-size records storage boxes, size 10” deep x 12” wide x 15” long, will fit on the shelves specified for each bay.  One cubic foot equals one standard box.  NARA stores 6 boxes on each 30” x 42” shelf; therefore a  primary shelving unit at 159” high would hold 84 cubic feet (boxes), and a primary shelving  unit at 135” high would hold 72 cubic feet (boxes).

22.  Question:  The verbiage states “ PRIMARY” and “FILL OUT” shelving units, showing different shelf sizes.  What do you mean by primary and fill out?  Are you meaning starter units and adder units?  

Answer:  Primary units with 30” x 42” shelves are NARA’s standard size.  However, to maximize capacity at the end of rows and around obstructions, NARA also uses smaller “fill-out” shelf sizes.

SHELVING SPECIFICATIONS:    The shelves shall be solid steel of clip type or nut-and bolt type construction in accordance with Federal Specifications AA-S-1048 or AA-S-271d.  Open or skeleton type shelving units shall be provided.  Two levels of both side and back cross strap braces are required on all shelving units (Seismic Level 1).  The shelving must be powder-coated with a polyester epoxy hybrid or best equivalent available that passes NARA-conducted or independent lab tests for hardness, and coating stability, bending, adhesion, and durability.  All shelving shall be a parchment color, per Federal Standard 595a, or other equally light reflective color.  DIMENSIONS:  The shelving units shall be constructed in accordance with NARA¡¦s FRC Shelving Drawing Number 1, (attached).  All shelving units to be provided and installed shall comply with very strict specifications in order to achieve optimal records storage capacity and access with the use of standard-size records storage boxes, size 10¡¨ deep x 12¡¨ wide x 15¡¨ long.  Overall height of 12-shelf units is 135 inches.  Overall height for 14-shelf units is 159 inches. These overall heights are specified for space, operational and fire safety reasons.  The primary shelving units shall be size 30¡¨ deep x 42¡¨ wide, with a minimum load carrying capacity of 300 pounds each.  Fill-out shelving units, size 30¡¨d x 30¡¨w, minimum load carrying capacity of 200#, and 16¡¨ w x 30¡¨d, minimum load carrying capacity of 100#, are also required.  All shelves are to be spaced on 12-inch vertical centers above 2-inch high base closures.  In order to accommodate standard size records storage boxes and servicing space, the following clearances must be provided on the faces of all units.  At least 39¡¨ of clear horizontal shelf space must be provided between the posts on all of the 42¡¨ wide units.  At least 10-1/2¡¨ of clear vertical storage space must be provided between all installed shelves.  2¡¨ high base closures must be provided on the face of all shelving units so that all records stored on the bottom shelves throughout the facility will be 3¡¨ above the floor finish in order to avoid damage to the records shelved on the bottom shelves from water spills as well as to avoid the accumulation of dust or files spillage under the bottom shelves.  30¡¨ wide x 135¡¨ high or 159¡¨ high (depending on upright height) end panels (partitions) shall be installed on the sides of all units facing the main 5¡¦ wide service aisles.   INSTALLATION ENVIRONMENT:  Access to all shelved records is from the standard 36¡¨ wide service aisles within very rigid storage height and access aisle constraints.   Special 34-inch wide mobile aluminum pulpit ladders are used to access all records stored on the upper shelves.  Each pulpit ladder has as its base rigid guide rollers on the sides of the four corners, which roll along the 42-inch wide shelving base closures, 2-inches above the floor surface, for smooth movement of the ladder in order not to bump and damage the shelved records.  All shelving base closures must be bolted or otherwise securely fastened to the shelving unit, at both ends.  The units will not become dislodged by the four guide rollers of the aluminum pulpit ladders during their movement in the aisles while servicing the stored records, or by common impact forces within the storage space.  INSTALLATION SERVICES:  The successful shelving contractor shall furnish the steel shelving and all associated supervision, personnel, tools, materials, and transportation necessary to install the shelving as ordered by NARA.  The shelving Contractor shall unload trucks, unpack, assemble and install the shelving in accordance with floor plans and instructions to be provided by the Contracting Officer¡¦s Representative (COR).  Shelving units shall be installed to the maximum extent in double (back-to-back) rows in accordance with FRC Shelving Drawing No. 1.  All units shall be bolted or clipped together within the double rows through the adjoining uprights at the approximate center of the upper, middle, and lower one-third of their height as a minimum.  The maximum tolerance from the vertical will be 1 inch in 10 feet or more in height.  Installation shall allow top shelf storage of records in standard size boxes.  SHELVING DELIVERY SCHEDULE:  The anticipated delivery schedule for installation of the base requirement is as follows:  Bay 1 (135¡¨ high shelving) in Lenexa, KS within 90 days of award date; Bay 2 (159¡¨ high shelving) at Lenexa, KS, October 2006; Bay 3 (159¡¨ high shelving) at Lenexa, KS, May 2007; Bay 4 (135¡¨ high shelving) at Lenexa, KS, October 2007.
