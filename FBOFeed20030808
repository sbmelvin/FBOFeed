<DESC>AIRPORT SYSTEMS:  PLANNING, DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT Performance Period: The course is required September 29, 2003 through October 3, 2003. Course Content:  The course must provide a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art airport planning and design.  It must address the strategic issues that airports face in the rapidly changing environment of international air transport.  It must provide detailed discussions of the following: 1.	Standard and emerging methods for evaluating airport needs, including latest computer models; 2.	Strategies for dealing with the variability of traffic and the problems of congestion and delays; 3.	Impacts of tightening security measures on airport operations and facilities; 4.	Design methodologies for airside facilities and modeling; 5.	Development of major new airports; 6.	The design of airport passenger buildings, automated baggage and people mover systems; 7.	Airport access and environment; 8.	Financing of airports by public and private agencies and by airport user charges; 9.	Competition between airports and multiple airport systems. A major theme for the course must be that airport planning takes place in a highly unpredictable environment.  It is therefore necessary to adopt flexible approaches to calls for new or expanded facilities.  Strategies toward capital investments should be multi-dimensional, not just technical or capital-intensive.  In addressing problems of congestion and delays, the course must explore the advantages of solutions involving the reallocation of resources, economic incentives, demand management, and the reconfiguration of services and facilities in combination with new construction. The course must also cover airport financing and security procedures.

Sherman, Program Manager, Phone (315) 330-7198, E-Mail: Kenneth.Sherman@rl.af.mil.  Renee F. Arcuri/Contracting Officer/315-330-4777.  This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 08.  Air Force Research Laboratory Rome Research Site (AFRL RRS) is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to increase AFRL's knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required in support of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) of warfighting techniques, equipment and capabilities. Solutions to basic research and engineering using innovative approaches will be sought. The scope of this effort primarily concerns the area of the Modeling and Simulation science, as applied to Air and Space systems, Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Space-Based Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (SBISR) sensors and covers a broad range of requirements which include, but are not limited to, improved real-time decision-making, predictive assessments, theoretical foundations of decision science, wargaming and course of action analyses. AFRL RRS requires solutions sufficient to meet the needs of the Air Force and the national modeling and simulation community (Air Force Battle Labs, National Air & Space Intelligence Center (NAIC), Joint Warfare Simulation (JWARS) Program Office, Air Force Agency for Modeling and Simulation (AFAMS), Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO), Air Force Warfighting Integration (AF/XI), etc.). Some areas of interest are: model abstraction techniques, multi-resolution M&S, modeling the cognitive process, synthetic environments, optimization approaches, hybrid dynamical systems, natural systems, predictive assessments, real-time decision making, M&S in distributed mission training, information visualization/animation, qualitative/fuzzy simulation , M&S for wargaming and exercise support, modeling paradigms/methodologies, behavior representation, model interoperability, among others, and involve feasibility studies, functional prototyping, proof-of-concept development/demonstration and specific Air and Space systems and military applications. Emphasis is placed on the insertion of technology into ongoing and planned simulation infrastructures and activities.  THIS ANNOUCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a one-sided, 12 point type, single spaced, one inch margined white paper not to exceed five (5) pages with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, women-owned small, or small disadvantaged business or historically black college, university or minority institution. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to AFRL/IFEB, ATTN: Donald J. Gondek (Reference BAA 03-12-IFKA) 32 Brooks Road, Rome, NY, 13441-4505. The white paper will be formatted as follows: SECTION A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task and Name of Company; SECTION B: Task Objective and SECTION C: Technical Summary. White papers must reference BAA 03-12-IFKA.  Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). White papers addressing different areas of applicability must be submitted under separate cover. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Offerors submitting white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Complete proposal instructions will be contained in a letter accepting your white paper and requesting a proposal. Such invitation does not assure the offeror will receive an award. Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Evaluation of white papers and solicited proposals will be performed using the following criteria: (1) Effectiveness in Enhancing Modeling and Simulation for Supporting the Air Force Mission (Soundness of Approach); (2) Relevance to the Air Force Mission; (3) Uniqueness of the Approach, and (4) Cost Realism and Reasonableness. Criteria 1 through 3 are of equal importance and Criteria 1 through 3 are more important than Criteria 4. Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Selected offerors may be required to review classified material up to the SECRET level; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to the proposed effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information. In addition, the offeror must have or have access to a certified and Government-approved facility available to support work under this BAA. Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months in duration; total dollar amounts for all awards is approximately $4.9M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 03 - $2K; FY 04 - $675k; FY 05 - $1.323M; FY 06 - $1.11M; FY 07 - $910k and FY 08 - $880k.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure procedures. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, AFRL/IFKA, Renee F. Arcuri/Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514, phone: 315-330-477, email: Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. The cost of preparing proposals in responding to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18. An informational briefing is not planned.  Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Renee Arcuri, telephone (315) 330-4777 or e-mail Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil.

<DESC>NA Market Value Appraisal of former Indiana Army Ammunition Plant.  Solicitation package will be available o/a 13 August 2003 and will be available by electronic copy only.  To download the solicitation package go to website http://ebs.lrl.usace.army.mil/ebs and click on solicitation DACA27-03-T-0045.  The property lies between State Highway 62 and the Ohio River near Charlestown, Clark County, Indiana.  The property contains approximately 4,390 acres.  There are numerous buildings of various sizes and uses, m ost of which have no or nominal value.  The government intends to retain a few buildings for ten years.  Information will be provided on those buildings.  Also, the government intends to burn various buildings.  Information on those will also be provided. Approximately 91 acres lie on the north end of the installation.  This area contained office buildings and was known as the administration area.  It housed the headquarters building.  Also there is a landfill area at the north end and an area improved with  storage and shipping houses. The south end of the installation contains the remaining property to be appraised.  Property near the state highway was originally the site of miscellaneous lower administration buildings, the clinic, change houses, and the ba g sewing building. Also at the south end and nearer the river are the powder load lines, igloos, and other support buildings that are still standing.  The last propellants were packed by the government in 1995.   This area contains approximately 260 buildi ngs, several storage tanks and approximately 26 miles of railroad track.  The railroad track is outleased to an operator.  There are explosive and burn arcs that impact use. Other Interests:  The property is currently leased to the INAAP Reuse Authority. There are approximately 47 existing subleases to the private sector, some of which were assumed by the reuse authority from the government.  Those leases must be analyzed and considered for their impact (enhancement or encumbrance), on market value.  Some of these leases involve operating utilities and current uses for explosive material.  Information will be provided on explosive arcs. The property will be appraised as clean and free from environmental contamination.  However, the appraiser will briefly di scuss known environmental problems and will have information available to him, including an environmental baseline study.  Other adjacent areas containing approximate 3,650 acres and running more or less along the eastern perimeter of the property will be transferred to the State of Indiana for use as a park. This property will not be included in the appraisal.  Also there are approximately 1,660 acres in the propellant and explosive manufacturing area that will not be included in the appraisal.  This prope rty lies between the north, administrative area and the southern loading/packing area discussed above. Before inspecting the property, the appraiser will coordinate visits with R. Marc Elliott, Executive Director of INAAP Reuse Authority.  The appraiser mu st also undergo a safety briefing before inspecting the property.  Mr. Elliott will coordinate all plans for this briefing.  The inspection date will be the valuation date of the appraisal. Mr. Elliott will have various documents available for the appraise rÃ¢Â€Â™s use.  Those include but are not limited to:  Master Development Plan for River ridge Commerce Center, June 2001; INAAP Installation Action Plan, 2002; INAAP Explosive Desensitization Plan, 2002; INAAP Preliminary Engineering Report, QK4 2002, and the Cultural Resources Management Plan. The appraiser may, or may not use information provided by the reuse (Mr. Elliott) as he deems appropriate.  The appraiser will develop his own, independent, objective opinions as to any and all property values, costs  and other estimates required to complete the appraisal from sources he deems reliable.  Requirements: The appraiser must be a state certified general appraiser .  The appraiser named as the principal appraiser in the proposal and in the demonstration of experience will be the signatory of the appraisal report.  The appraiser shall prepare a complete, narrative self-contained appraisal.   If necessary, the apprais er may adopt support reports of experts in other fields that may contribute to the understanding and valuation of the elements of market value.  Such experts must be professionals recognized in their areas of expertise and hold appropriate certificates, re gistrations or acknowledgments.  Any person signing the appraisal report will have sufficient knowledge and experience to meet the Competency Rule of USPAP within the context of the appraisal problem. The appraisals will comply with the Uniform Appraisal S tandards for Federal Land Acquisition (yellow book) http://www.usdoj.gov/enrd/land-ack/, and the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) http://www.appraisalfoundation.org/uspap/toc.htm.  If there are conflicting standards, the Uniform  Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisition will prevail and the appraiser may invoke jurisdictional exception.  The market value definition will be taken from the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisition. National, regional and local  economic conditions must be considered in developing the highest and best use and the estimates of market value.  Those conditions as they affect value must be discussed in the appraisal reports. The appraisal must thoroughly describe the property and inc lude adequate color photographs to give the reader a visual understanding of the improvements.  Also include an aerial photograph if possible. In evaluating the Highest and Best Use, the appraiser should take into account the full range of potential purcha sers in the market.  By legislative directive, the subject property will be transferred for industrial reuse, which defines the highest and best use of that tract.  However, one would assume that site specific improvements could be used for administration support or industrial commercial support use.  Highest and Best Use as though vacant and improved must be discussed as to the type of industrial user.  A conclusion will be drawn and thoroughly supported.  A discussion of marketing time and absorption shou ld be included if applicable. An in-progress draft should be submitted for review approximately 30 days before completion of the appraisal report. Six copies of the final report will be submitted. The finished report must be completed within 120 days after  award of the contract.  The appraiser may be required to attend one or more meetings in connection with the valuation of the subject property. The appraiser shall not publish any data in whole or in part, pertaining to the appraisal report or appraisal su bject, or in any manner or form authorize others to do so without the written consent of the Government, or until such time as the Government may have released such data to the public. An authorized review appraiser designated by the government must review  the appraisal.  Thirty (30) days will be allowed for appraisal review and payment.  However, the government may consider partial payment dependent upon receiving drafts and/or synopses of work completed. A real estate map and a list of improvements will b e forwarded to prospective contractors if requested. The Government will establish a committee to review and evaluate the proposals received. The evaluation will be based exclusively on the content of the information provided with the proposal, and any sub sequent discussions required to clarify the information received with the original proposal.  Any information or data incorporated by reference or otherwise referred to in the original proposal will not be considered.  If neither clarifications nor further  negotiations are required, an award will be made based on original proposal. The following factors will be considered during the evaluation process listed in o rder of descending importance: 1) Principal appraiserÃ¢Â€Â™s experience in appraising large industrial and/or mixed-use government-owned properties; principal appraiserÃ¢Â€Â™s experience in appraising government-owned properties intended for disposal; prin cipal appraiserÃ¢Â€Â™s experience in appraising closed industrial facilities; appraiserÃ¢Â€Â™s experience in appraising active heavy industrial facilities; principal appraiserÃ¢Â€Â™s experience in appraising leased fee industrial and/or mixed-use propertie s; general experience, education and professional designations of the principal appraiser and appraisal staff; demonstration of principal appraiserÃ¢Â€Â™s ability to provide manpower, transportation, materials and facilities to meet time requirements; and principal appraiserÃ¢Â€Â™s willingness to attend meeting(s) with principal parties for discussion of valuation analyses pertaining to the subject property.  2) Experience in Appraising Large Industrial and/or Mixed-Use Government-Owned Property; 3) Experie nce in Appraising Government-Owned Properties Intended for Disposal; 4) Experience in Appraising Closed Industrial Facilities ; 5)Experience in Appraising Active Heavy Industrial Facilities; 6) Experience in Appraising Leased Fee Industrial and/or Mixed-Us e Properties; 7) General Experience, Education and Professional Designations of the Principal Appraiser and Appraisal Staff; 8) Demonstration of Principal AppraiserÃ¢Â€Â™s Ability to Provide Manpower, Transportation, Materials and Facilities to meet Time R equirements; 9) Willingness to Attend Meeting(s); and 10) Price.

The white-tailed prairie dog has been petitioned for listing (July 11, 2002) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and is a Wyoming BLM Sensitive Species.    Because sensitive species do not require Section 7 Consultation (Sect 7) under the ESA with the U.S.D.I. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the BE will not be prepared for such consultation.

Therefore, this BE shall be prepared in an identical fashion and format as a biological assessment (BA). The BE will cover ten (10) of Wyoming BLM's 12 land use plans.  The BE will assess impacts to white-tailed prairie dogs for actions conducted on surface lands managed by, or actions granted by, the BLM.  The BE will be prepared in such a way that the various impacts affecting white-tailed prairie dogs and resulting analysis can be "pulled" from the BE document and placed in each respective individual land use plan as appropriate. The contractor will be required to furnish all labor, supervision, travel, equipment, supplies, materials, and other incidentals to complete this project.  The project is estimated between $25,000 and $100,000.  This is a set-aside for small business concerns.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC, for the development of a report on Indoor Particulate Matter (PM) Resuspension Testing for Metals to determine the resuspension of "tracked-in" metal from soil/dust deposited on medium pile carpeting to estimate whether resuspended PM contribute significantly to indoor air exposures and the potential for translocation to indoor horizontal surfaces, under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1. The U.S. EPA Air Pollution Prevention and Control Division  believes that RTI International is the only known supplier who can provide the required report because of RTI International's previous development of dust resuspension characterization methodologies for PM on carpeting and the necessity for the conditions of testing to be identical to that  preceding effort. Accordingly, APPCD believes that no contractor would be able to replicate those conditions  without incurring substantial cost in duplicting the methodologies characterization. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting this  EPA requirement may submit technical documentation to establish its assertion.  The documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of the electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the  discretion of the EPA.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. The applicable NAICS code is 541380, Testing Laboratories. The applicable size standard is $6 million.   This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13.  The anticipated award date is 09/15/03.  See numbered note 26.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research (CCR) Confocal Core Facility in the Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression (LRBGE) plans to procure an LSM 510 META Confocal Microscope system with FCS Confocor 2 Attachment Configured with Motorized Axiovert 200 Inverted Research Microscope from Carl Zeiss Inc., One Zeiss Drive, Thornwood, NY 10594.  The LRBGE has the need for a system  that provides confocal analysis and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy of a wide range of biological specimens.  This approach will enable sensitive analysis of molecular mobilities and interactions in living cells.  This system can also function as a conventional confocal for fixed and live cell studies by using the visible Argon and HeNe lasers.  The FCS capability will enable measurement of molecular mobilities as well as interactions between molecules.  The Zeiss LSM 510 FCS has a fourth PMT, the Meta detector, which enables users to collect hard to separate fluorophore pairs like CFP/YFP and GFP/YFP.  Since the Confocal Core Facility is a multi-user environment they require a system that is easy to operate and provides reliable quantitative data.  This microscope provides the following features: 1) each detector is equipped with its own pinhole for the possibility of simultaneous scanning with identical slice thickness;  2) full 360 degree scan rotation, scan zoom and offset with no x/y stage centering; 3) digital scan control which allows for the following hardware/software functionality:  constant scanning velocity for all speeds, even illumination along scanning fields with identical pixel conditions, short fly back time (less than 2% of frame cycle), on-line modification of scanning and detector settings, on-line histogram and lut's for optimization, sample preservation via beam blanking only in regions of interest and FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching);  4) system is equipped with a spectral scanner that incorporates a 32 PMT using a grating for high speed, efficient, electronic switching between spectrally separated detector elements, both binning and spectral scanning is electronically managed by the software;  5)  system is capable of emission fingerprinting with at least 10 nm collection upon delivery of any LSM and supports all acquisition modes x, y, z, t and lambda rapidly; 6)  the spectral detector allows electronic high speed selection wavelength range including quick and easy switching between overlapping band pass channels;  7) optical correction of individual objective lenses via fully motorized collimation optics integrated and software controlled; and 8) system provides single button control to implement identical system conditions from any previously collected image.  This system is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  Carl Zeiss Inc. is the only organization known to the NCI researcher that has all the aforementioned features that are required and believed to be unique. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement and the noted features, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on August 14, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.   NAICS 334516

<DESC>The contractor will employ a supplier/manufacturer network with the resources, finances and supply chain management capability to support planned and un-planned requirements.  The logistics solutions will integrate the various sources of supply, thereby achieving robust competition at the supplier level, while still providing seamless interface with DLA and its customers.  These sophisticated logistics solutions require a continuous open exchange of information between customer, supplier and DLA.  A seamless logistics system with state of the art information technology and assured communications is essential for optimum support and total asset visibility.

This program provides total supply chain management in support of consumables used in maintenance, repair and overhaul of weapon systems.  The contractor will employ a combination of commercial and government (Defense Logistics Agency or DLA) sources of supply in the performance of logistics support.  The contractor will also provide support of worldwide requirements for selected items, Just-In-Time support and at least 98 percent fill rates for all schedule of items requirements. 

There will be multiple solicitations; each solicitation may support one or more sites.  The first solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis.  The customer base for this initial solicitation includes NADEPS Cherry Point, Havelock, NC, Jacksonville, FL and North Island, San Diego, CA and their remote locations.  The scope includes 39,050 National Stock Numbers (NSN) with a total estimated annual price of approximately $50,000,000.  The Market Basket consists of 2,000 commercially sourced items and 2,000 DLA sourced items which is expected to represent the profile of commercially sourced and DLA sourced items for the contract term, which is a subpopulation of the schedule of items.  Some items will be designated as world-wide-demand and some for site-only use.  Unanticipated requirements will be supported by spot buys.  Offerors are required to provide a unit price and a total price for each NSN, a material management price and a grand total evaluated price (Note: all estimated prices are fully burdened to include material cost, profit and f.o.b. destination).  It is the Government’s intent to issue an Indefinite Quantity, Fixed-Price with EPA contract.  The solicitation will contain a 3-year base period with two 2-year term options and one 3-year term option.  The solicitation will utilize best value source selection procedures.  The government will consider other factors in addition to price when evaluating proposals to determine the best overall expected value.  Technical merit is considered significantly more important than price.  The evaluation factors will be Technical Merit, Experience & Past Performance, Socio-Economic Consideration, Javits Wagner O’Day Considerations and DLA Mentoring Business Agreement Program.  Deliveries will be Just-In-Time for the designated sites; offerors are also required to submit a delivery schedule for the World Wide Demand quantities.  Note: Deliveries may vary among product lines; offerors are required to provide a delivery schedule for each of the 2000 commercially sourced items on the market basket.  The deadline for receipt of proposals will be sixty (60) days from the solicitation issue date.  The solicitation will not become available until the solicitation issue date.  We plan on conducting site visits approximately two weeks after the solicitation issue date.  The Schedule of Items and the Market Basket can be obtained, WHEN THE SOLICITATION IS ISSUED, by accessing the DSCP website at www.dscp.dla.mil/gi/general/ipvsites.htm.

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) wishes to announce an opportunity for small business to bid on a Competitive Total Set-Aside to conduct a Definitional Mission (DM) for multi-sector projects in Gabon and Sao Tome & Principe.   USTDA has received requests for assistance from Gabon and Sao Tome & Principe in recent months, in addition to requests from the U.S. Embassy Libreville that covers both countries.  The varied opportunities merit the analysis of technical experts and these include technical assistance to the Government of Gabon for the development and management of opportunities connected to tourism infrastructure development under the U.S.-led Congo Basin Forest Partnership announced by Secretary of State Powell in 2002.  Potential projects in Gabon also include hydrocarbon and power sector projects.  The demand for USTDA assistance in Sao Tome & Principe is based on the country’s basic needs for modern infrastructure, including port and airport improvements, and there will also be downstream hydrocarbon and power opportunities to consider.

Gabon and the Congo Basin-The Congo Basin is the second largest tropical rainforest in the world and the country of Gabon is seventy percent covered by forest.  In September 2002, Secretary Powell launched the Congo Basin Forest Partnership (CBFP) at the World Summit on Sustainable Development.  There are 29 members of the CBFP, including six Congo Basin countries, other donor country partners, and non-governmental organizations.  The CBFP is an initiative that recognizes the integral nature of economic development, social development and environmental protection within the goals of sustainable development.  The CBFP provides support for a network of national parks and protected areas, well-managed forestry concessions, and creation of economic opportunities that depend on the conservation of the outstanding forest and wildlife resources of the Congo Basin.  The CBFP marks a significant commitment of funding by the U.S. government to this multi-national environmental initiative. 

USTDA’s direct engagement with the initiative would support the U.S. government policy goals for the Congo Basin region.  The DM team would work with the Government of Gabon through its Ministry of Tourism and Environment, and the National Environment Planning Council that includes the President of Gabon, the current U.S. Ambassador to Gabon and the director of the Central African Regional Program for the Environment (CARPE) to identify regional opportunities for assistance.  Through the U.S. Embassy in Libreville and State Department’s headquarters, USTDA assistance has been requested to help the responsible organizations in Gabon to develop a sustainable eco-tourism sector.  

The DM team would consider technical assistance to the appropriate party in Gabon to develop needed tourism infrastructure.  Tourism in the Region, and in Gabon in particular, has also been hindered because of antiquated visa systems and processes.  The DM team would search to answer how Gabon could improve its systems to better accommodate international visitors.

Sao Tome and Principe-The U.S. Embassy in Libreville, Gabon, also covers the island nation of Sao Tome and Principe.  The country has been heavily reliant on agricultural commodities such as cocoa until recent deepwater offshore exploration has proven significant oil reserves.  The oil-rich Gulf of Guinea region, which includes major producers including Nigeria and Angola, is a focus of exploration and development. Sao Tome and Principe, a nation of just 150,000, is eager to join the league with shared offshore acreage. With such proven reserves, the small country is achieving a new level of strategic importance.  The government of Sao Tome and Principe has pledged transparency and stands against possible corruption once oil revenues begin.  It is expected that the first barrels of be produced from Sao Tome and Principe’s territorial waters by 2005. 

The President of Sao Tome and Principe has expressed concern for the need to develop employment for its citizens.  The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, after recently visiting the country, pledged U.S. support to the developing nation.  The potential demand for USTDA assistance is based on the country’s basic needs for modern infrastructure, including port and airport improvements, and there will also be downstream hydrocarbon and power opportunities to consider.  

The DM team would help to define potential projects and provide recommendation for USTDA funding.  The analysis would include a review of the overall soundness for each project, the finance ability of each project, the development priority of the projects for their respective host countries, and the U.S. export potential of each of the projects.  The environmental impact and impact on U.S. labor would also be reviewed, among other required USTDA funding criteria.

The Contractor will be required to travel to Gabon and Sao Tome & Principe to scope out potential projects that may meet the requirements of USTDA funding.  Before traveling, the Contractor will be required to consult with USTDA.  The Contractor shall evaluate the financing ability of the projects; the development priority of the projects for the host country; the U.S. export potential of the projects; and the general strengths and weaknesses of the individual projects.  In addition, the Contractor will examine all other USTDA funding criteria and will develop a budget and terms of reference for each project recommended to USTDA for funding.
 

The Contractor must demonstrate a broad range of experience that includes experience in at least the general sectors that will be covered in the definitional mission.  The Contractor must be qualified to evaluate the economic, financial and technical viability of the potential projects.  In addition, knowledge of French and Portuguese is required; if the Contractor does not have French and/or Portuguese fluency within the team, French and/or Portuguese translation must be addressed in the proposal and budget.  It is expected that a team of at least two persons will be required to have the appropriate experience for this multi-sector mission.

The Contractor should not expect to be provided with specific materials or information, other than limited contact information, from USTDA in advance; project opportunities will need to be developed by the Contractor from both research in the U.S. and while traveling in country.
 
This contract calls for the Contractor to provide important evaluation services in connection with potential project opportunities. It is essential that such evaluation be conducted with complete impartiality and objectivity and that the Contractor and its Subcontractors not obtain an unfair competitive advantage in USTDA-funded activities resulting from this contract. In accordance with the principles of FAR Subpart 9.5 and USTDA policy, the Contractor and its Subcontractors, if any, for this contract shall be ineligible to compete for, as a prime or subcontractor or otherwise, USTDA-funded activities that result from this contract, unless USTDA through its Contracts Office,  

The estimated cost for this work does not exceed $35,000.

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) promotes American private sector participation in developing middle-income countries, with special emphasis on economic sectors that represent significant U.S. export potential.  Through funding a variety of activities, USTDA helps U.S. businesses compete for infrastructure and capacity building projects in emerging markets and supports U.S. policy objectives.

USTDA assists in building mutually beneficial partnerships between American companies and overseas project sponsors, which result in increased U.S. exports and jobs and the completion of high quality, successful projects in host countries.  

The Small Business Act, at 15, U.S.C. 252, authorizes procuring agencies to set aside procurements or portions of procurements for the exclusive participation of Small Businesses Concerns.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this procurement is 541330.

Definition: “Small business concerns” for purposes of USTDA award of this total set aside contract means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operating for which it is bidding.  In determining whether dominance exists for USTDA’s purpose for this contract, consideration is given to annual gross receipts.  Any concern with an annual gross receipts above $5 million dollars, averaged over a three year period, is not considered small and is therefore, NOT eligible for award under this contract.

All participating organizations involved with supplying professional services must be incorporated or chartered in the United States.  Consultants planning teaming arrangements must be U.S. citizens or resident aliens.  In accordance with FAR 19.301, offerors will be required to submit self-certification relating to business size.  The competitive proposals method of solicitation as set forth in Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR Chapter 1) shall be utilized for this procurement.  This solicitation does not obligate USTDA to award a contract, nor does it commit USTDA to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the proposal.  Any explanation desired by an offeror regarding the meaning or interpretation of this solicitation must be requested in writing and with sufficient time allowed for reply to reach the offerors before submission of their offerors.  All oral explanations or instruction, given before award of this contract will not be binding.  Any information given to a prospective offeror concerning the solicitation will be furnished promptly to all prospective offerors as an amendment of the solicitation, if such information is necessary to offerors submitting proposals or if lack of such information would be prejudicial to uninformed offerors.

The contractor must be in the position to present fair and unbiased information pursuant to the statement of work.

USTDA is considering the provision of grant funds for feasibility studies or technical assistance in the construction materials sector in Afghanistan. USTDA seeks to contract with a U.S. firm (Contractor) to conduct a Definitional Mission (DM) to analyze the proposed projects.

As with other sectors of Afghan society, the domestic capacity to produce construction supplies has been decimated.  The reconstruction of Afghanistan would benefit greatly from the development of local production of construction materials that could supply both large reconstruction projects and the demands of the local population.  

The supply of cement on the Afghan market provides an example of the scale and need and lack of information regarding this sector of the economy.  According to the information available, Afghanistan currently produces about 36,000 tons of cement per year at a plant neat the village of Pul-I-Komri.  Estimates of annual demand for cement range from 3-8 million tons.  Thus most cement is now imported at great expense from neighboring countries, including Pakistan and Iran.  

The projects to be reviewed include:

Upgrades and/or Construction of Cement Production Facilities
Upgrades and/or Construction of Stone Crushing Plants
An Orientation Visit for Construction Sector Officials
Capacity Building Program for Construction Sector
Others identified during the DM

The Contractor will be required to travel to Afghanistan to review the proposed projects. The Contractor must be qualified to evaluate the economic, financial and technical viability of the proposed projects. Specifically, the Contractor shall provide expert analysis on: potential risks of the proposed projects; the finance ability of the projects and likely sources of financing; potential exports of U.S. equipment and services that could be utilized in project implementation; and priority of the proposed projects to the host country. The Contractor shall provide a report to USTDA that includes a thorough analysis of the foregoing issues and a recommendation on whether USTDA should fund a feasibility study or other activity. If the recommendation is to provide funding for the activity, the Contractor shall also develop a sound budget and Terms of Reference (TOR) for the activity. 

This contract calls for the Contractor to provide important evaluation services in connection with the proposed projects. It is essential that such evaluation be conducted with complete impartiality and objectivity and that the Contractor and its Subcontractors not obtain an unfair competitive advantage in USTDA-funded activities resulting from this contract. In accordance with the principles of FAR Subpart 9.5 and USTDA policy, the Contractor and its Subcontractors, if any, for this contract shall be ineligible to compete for, as a prime or subcontractor or otherwise, USTDA-funded activities that result from this contract, unless USTDA through its Contracts Office, shall have granted a waiver, based upon FAR 9.503, that preclusion of the Contractor or its Subcontractors from the follow-on activity would not be in the Government’s interest. This restriction shall remain in effect for three (3) years from the termination of this contract. The Contractor is responsible for including this restriction in all subcontracts.


The Government's estimate for this procurement does not exceed $35,000.00.

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) wishes to announce an opportunity for small business to bid on a Competitive Total Set-Aside to conduct a Definitional Mission (DM) to visit Angola, Republic of the Congo (Congo-Brazzaville), and Equatorial Guinea, to identify and evaluate oil and gas projects and related power projects for potential USTDA support.  These three countries have witnessed dramatic development in their hydrocarbon industries over the past decade and are beginning to approach USTDA for assistance in developing new downstream production and energy projects.  Infrastructure development in this sector assists in generating greater prosperity in the region and consequently creates a more stable political environment.  

Angola, Republic of the Congo, and Equatorial Guinea all seek to derive more economic development from the development of downstream hydrocarbon opportunities as these would result in new employment and revenue streams for the three countries’ economies.  Because power supply is scarce in these countries and using gas that is currently flared in order to develop new power generation would also be a significant additional benefit of such hydrocarbon projects.  Further, refining and petrochemical developments would stimulate a variety of sub-sectors that represent economic priorities to the host countries.  

Angola:  Angola is the second largest producer of oil in Sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria.  Angola has been the site of several significant discoveries since the mid 1990’s.  These findings, coupled with the end of the long-lasting civil war, have resulted in new commercial interest in Angola.  Key foreign companies active in Angola include: Energy Africa, Agip, ChevronTexaco, and TotalFinaElf.  Angola has estimated reserves of 1.6 tcf of natural gas.  Currently 85% of the associated gas is flared.  

Several project opportunities exist for USTDA consideration.  The government is implementing strategies to reduce flaring and to increase the commercial use of natural gas.  There are currently plans for a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project. Sonangol, the state oil company, is interested in upgrading its refinery.    

Republic of the Congo:  Elf Congo holds a pre-eminent position, alongside Agip, TotalFinaElf, BP-Amoco, and ChevronTexaco in Republic of the Congo’s exploration, production and refining.  Republic of the Congo is sub-Saharan Africa’s fourth largest producer in oil.  It is increasingly exporting oil to the United States partly based on the construction of new rigs offshore.   Net exports were approximately 12.2 million tons in 1997 (245,000 bpd) and 12.8 million tons in 1998 (257,000 bpd).  Republic of the Congo’s main crude export markets are the United States and Italy.  

Power transmission and downstream refinery projects offer opportunities for USTDA review.

Equatorial Guinea:  An oil boom in the 1990s transformed this small African nation into one of the principal players in the African oil industry.  Equatorial Guinea’s newly discovered La Ceiba deepwater field has estimated reserves of 300 to 500 million barrels.  The main companies based in Equatorial Guinea include: ExxonMobil, Repsol, ChevronTexaco, Vanco Energy, and TotalFinaElf.  

The government of Equatorial Guinea is interested in developing a new refinery and new power transmission projects, and has invited USTDA to consider feasibility studies for these projects.  

The DM team would help to define potential projects and provide recommendation for USTDA funding.  The analysis would include a review of the overall soundness for each project, the finance ability of each project, the development priority of the projects for their respective host countries, and the U.S. export potential of each of the projects.  The environmental impact and impact on U.S. labor would also be reviewed, among other required USTDA funding criteria.

The Contractor will be required to travel to Angola, Republic of the Congo, and Equatorial Guinea to scope out potential projects that may meet the requirements of USTDA funding.

The Contractor shall evaluate the financing ability of the projects; the development priority of the projects for the host country; the U.S. export potential of the projects; and the general strengths and weaknesses of the individual projects.

The Contractor must demonstrate a broad range of experience that includes specific experience in the hydrocarbon and power sectors that will be covered in the definitional mission.  The Contractor must be qualified to evaluate the economic, financial and technical viability of the potential projects.  In addition, knowledge of French, Portuguese, and Spanish is highly desired; if the Contractor does not have French and/or Portuguese and/or Spanish fluency within the team, French and/or Portuguese and/or Spanish interpretation and translation must be addressed in the proposal and budget.  

The Contractor should not expect to be provided with specific materials or information, other than limited contact information, from USTDA in advance; project opportunities will need to be developed by the Contractor from both research in the U.S. and while traveling in country.

This restriction shall remain in effect for three (3) years from the termination of this contract. The Contractor is responsible for including this restriction in all subcontracts.

The estimated cost for this work does not exceed $40,000.

The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Factor 1, Corporate Capability and Experience, is the most important and is significantly more than Factor 2 and 3; Factors 2 and 3, Price and Past Performance, are least important and are of equal importance and weight with respect to each other:   (i) Corporate Capability and Experience (1) The offeror is a licensed insurance company, incorporated or legally organized in any of the fifty States or the District of Columbia, having its principal place of business in one or more of them.  The offeror is rated as at least 'B+, Very Good' in A . M. Best's Insurance Report - (or an equivalent rating with a comparable insurance reporting company).   (2) The offeror is on the United States Department of Labor list of insurance carriers approved to provide Defense Base Act insurance.   The offeror is actively engaged in providing DBA or similar international worker's compensation coverage or equivalent during the 2-year period immediately preceding the award. (3) Demonstrated ability to simultaneously manage the large number of insurance coverage requests anticipated under the resulting contract, with a wide area of labor types and work environments.   (4) Offerors demonstrated experience in providing DBA or similar international worker's compensation coverage or State coverage.  At a minimum, the offeror must be actively engaged in providing DBA or similar international worker's compensation coverage or  State coverage during the two-year period immediately preceding the award of this contract. (ii) Price Reasonableness of rates and discounts.   (iii)  Past Performance Information:  Offerors are required to provide past performance references for itself and each proposed subcontractor.  Past performance evaluations will focus on the contractors': record of conforming to contract requirements, cont ractor's adherence to contract schedules, history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; record of claim payments and/or success of litigation concerning challengs to payment.  An adjectival rating system will be used for the above factors.  Adjectival ratings will be based on strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies, if any, of each proposal submitted in response to this Request for Quote (RFQ).  The Adjectival ratings to be used  will include: Excellent, Good, Acceptable, Marginal and Unacceptable. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly un balanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall resul t in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of with drawal is received before award. (End of clause) STATEMENT OF WORK a. GOAL: The purpose of this contract is to provide a source of WorkerÃ¢Â€Â™s Compensation Insurance as required by the Defense Base Act (DBA) [Public--No. 208--77th Congress Passed August 16, 1941, as Amended] , as implemented by FAR 52.228-4 WorkersÃ¢Â€Â ™ Compensation and War-Hazard Insurance Overseas, for contracts awarded by Defense Contracting Command Washington (DCC-W).  The contractor shall provide a discount, or government rate, for any DCC-W contract requiring DBA insurance with performance in Iraq , Afghanistan, and Kuwait. The rate established under this contract for DBA coverage shall also be available to any contracts awarded by any Department of Defense agency with performance in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kuwait. Establishing this contract will red uce the cost of DBA insurance based on economies of scale.   b. BACKGROUND:  The DBA was enacted to provide compensation for disability or death to persons employed at military, air, and naval bases outside the United States. Under DBA, contracts involving any overseas performance, the contractor is required by law to provide overseas employees with insurance coverage. DBA coverage applies to individuals employed under DOD contracts or subcontracts or subordinate contracts regardless of the duration of their assignment, and is over and above any State WorkerÃ¢Â€Â™s C ompensation insurance coverage. Currently FAR 52.228-4 places the responsibility of obtaining Workers Compensation insurance as a contractor responsibility. Given factors such as the magnitude of the program and evolutionary conditions, it is envisioned th at this contract vehicle could provide an environment where service providers (contractors), customers (various government offices) and a designated Preferred Provider (insurer) could all form a flexible, responsive, and efficient WorkersÃ¢Â€Â™ Compensatio n program at an reasonable rate. This environment would streamline many aspects of the program processes such as assuring FAR 31.205-19 Insurance and Indemnification compliance, contract pricing elements and the administration of the contracts/program.  All direct contractors must procure DBA insurance under this requirements contract unless they have: (1)	A DBA self-insurance program approved by the Department of Labor; or, (2)	An approved retrospective rating plan for DBA insurance. Waivers from Defense Base Act insurance have been issued by the Department of Labor for foreign nationals, either Third country National (TCN) or Cooperating Country Nationals (CCN).  A Third Country National (TCN) is an individual who is neither a Coopera ting Country National or United StatesÃ¢Â€Â™ National, but a citizen of a country included in geographic code 935 (see 22 CFR 228.3).  A Cooperating Country National is an individual who is a citizen of the cooperating country, or a non-cooperating country  lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the cooperating country.  Foreign national employees covered by this waiver are exempt from the requirement to secure DBA insurance but must be provided workerÃ¢Â€Â™s compensation benefits as prescribed in appl icable foreign laws.  Waivers have been obtained for foreign nationals in over 80 countries.   C. APPROACH:  The contractor shall deal directly with the companies requiring DBA insurance. Payment arrangements shall be between both parties. The government shall not be responsible for payments, correspondence or administrative issues between these par ties.  The government will not guarantee the purchase of any DBA insurance as a result of this contract.  The government will not guarantee a minimum or maximum order. The contractor shall accept an y order placed by government contractorÃ¢Â€Â™s requiring DBA insurance.  Because worldwide events significantly affect the DBA rates, the established rates will be reviewed every six months. Economical adjustments, increase or decrease, will be appropriate ly made. No government funds will be allocated under this agreement or  contract. Reimbursement for DBA insurance will be under the appropriate contract.

<DESC>The following are the minimum requirements for the Emergency Notification System: Require a user friendly computerized system to drastically speed up mass notifications by making multiple, automated notifications simultaneously (20-24) reaching individuals/agencies via telephones, cell phones and pagers.  
 
System must allow individuals to call into the system via id codes to retrieve active messages.
 
Allow for controllers access contact information to temporarily mark an individual as not to be contacted.  This action would ensure individual is not contacted under any activated scenario.  Such as for a commander on leave.
 
System must allow controllers ability to deactivate scenarios prior to completion.
 
System must allow administrator to configure scenario order of contact attempts such as for home phones, work, cell, etc. based upon duty hours/non-duty hours etc.
 
System must allow for simple notifications (system delivers message direct to any actual person answering phone), and secure notifications (not classified, but verification of user through PIN number and asks for person by name)
 
System must be capable of determining when phone and cell phone lines are being answered and distinguish between answering machines and actual persons and to reply with different messages for each.
 
System must be capable of activating scenarios from computer keyboard/mouse commands or buy calling into the system with a valid id code.  Scenarios must allow administrators to be capable of allowing/disallowing activation via call-in by phone.
 
Ability for controllers to temporarily de-activate/deselect individuals from being called on a scenario about to be activated.  Person temporarily deactivated would be called upon running that or any other scenario later.
 
Ability for controllers to make on-the-fly messages when running scenarios
 
System must allow controllers to immediately view/monitor scenario calling progress and store scenario contact information for future use and printing of predetermine reports to a printer or fax.
 
Allow different user levels where administrator has all privileges and can create other user accounts and select different access right for each user.  Example:  Controllers capable of activating scenarios and contact information, but not scenario setup
 
Ability to create group list based on static (administrator choosing names), or dynamic (auto- updating list based on criteria).  System allows for user defined fields to be used for dynamic grouping
 
Capability for administrator to change message introductions, basic messages, and ending messages for each scenario
 
The system must be capable of multiple, a minimum of 6, simultaneous scenarios using a priority system based upon numerical prioritization. 
 
The system must allow for incoming calls for activation of new scenarios or individuals retrieving messages while making multiple calls for running scenarios. 
 
Paging notifications must be capable of supporting notifications for all digital, voice, and text pagers.
 
Capable of storing/using contact information for unlimited individuals and/or base agencies
System must be able to retrieve and store certain information/responses from individuals/agencies being called based on scenario questions.
 
Require Initial training and set-up of system.

All quotes will be evaluated on conformance to specifications, price, and best value to the government.  The new closing date for this solicitation will be 18 August 2003, 4:00 PM Central Standard Time. Late quotes will not be accepted.

3.0 Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). The Coast Guard shall provide three each Interactor ICS 48/20 battery chargers for package installation design development.  The contractor shall be responsible for maintaining and accounting for all GFE provided.
4.0 Contractor Furnished Items. The Contractor shall furnish everything required to perform this contract except for GFE listed in Paragraph 3.0.
5.0. Requirements.
5.1. Two Phase Approach.   This effort shall consist of two phases as described below:  Phase I – Design a Battery Charger Installation Kit, to include battery monitor/alarm equipment, and supporting documentation.  Phase II – Pending acceptance testing and approval by the Coast Guard (C2CEN), produce 68 battery charger installation kits, to include all cabling, conduit, and other hardware identified during Phase I.
5.1.1 Phase I – System Configurations.  The Coast Guard anticipates the need for the battery charger installation kit to be flexible in configuration to accommodate individual DGPS site equipment shelter differences.  There are several DGPS site equipment shelters used by the Coast Guard, constructed of fiberglass, concrete, or aluminum.  The Coast Guard standard back-up battery configuration is as follows:  12 size 8G8D gel cell 12Volt Direct Current (VDC) batteries connected in series to provide a total combined output of 144VDC.  The 12 batteries are mounted to a three-shelf battery rack, with four batteries per shelf.  Each shelf provides a total of 48VDC.  The battery charger installation kit design shall not exceed 900 cubic inches of space and not exceed 140 lbs. of weight.  The kit can be installed either on the bulkhead adjacent to the battery rack, or on the battery rack itself.  If mounted to the battery rack, the kit shall be mounted to either side, or the front of the battery rack.  The kit and battery chargers shall be secured in such a way that they will not come loose from their installation due to earthquake movement.  If mounted to the battery rack, the kit shall be easily removable by two technicians in less than 15 minutes from the battery rack to allow for battery replacement and battery maintenance.  The kit removal scenario shall include that the battery chargers be removed from the installation kit to lighten the load prior to removing the rest of the kit.  All cables attached to the kit (including cables attached to the battery chargers and power panel as applicable) shall allow sufficient length/slack for removal of the kit for temporary placement on the equipment shelter floor to prevent the cables from stretching during temporary removal.  A hinged kit can also be considered.  If a removable kit is designed, it shall have flexible conduit to allow for repeated kit removal and re-installation without damaging the cables.  The kit shall include a power distribution panel with one main supply circuit breaker and three load circuit breakers, one for each battery charger for individual circuit interruption.  The battery charger power cables shall be hardwired to the kit power distribution panel, and shall meet NEC standards to be rated for at least 120% current draw for each battery charger.  The kit power distribution panel and load circuit breakers shall conform to NEC standards to be rated for 120% maximum current draw for each battery charger.  The kit power distribution panel main supply breaker shall conform to NEC standards for total distribution panel current draw.  The supply cable feeding the kit power distribution panel shall comply with NEC standards for total current draw.  The kit power distribution panel shall not exceed 24 inches tall, 24 inches wide, and eight inches deep, and shall be grounded according to the equipment shelter central electrical ground point, in accordance with NEC standards.  The kit shall include three battery monitor/alarm devices that will include at a minimum, normally closed (NC), and normally open (NO) dry alarm contacts.  The battery monitor/alarm devices shall at a minimum monitor 48VDC, to alarm under any of the following user adjustable alarm threshold conditions:  High Voltage, Low Voltage, High Current, and Battery Charger Failure.  The battery monitor/alarm device shall be compatible with gel cell and Absorbed Glass Mat style batteries, without the need to return the monitor/alarm device to the factory to be modified for either.  There shall be one battery monitor/alarm device per battery rack shelf.  Each battery monitor/alarm shall monitor four batteries connected in series.  The battery monitor/alarm negative cable shall be connected to the negative terminal of the first battery on the shelf (according to directional current flow) and the positive battery monitor/alarm cable shall be connected to the fourth battery on the same shelf, in order to monitor 48VDC.  The battery monitor/alarm devices shall be of high impedance, not to draw more than 100 milliamps during normal operations, including while the monitor/alarm device is in the alarm state.  They shall not interfere with normal battery charging or while the batteries are under load, providing back-up power to the Southern Avionics Company SC-1000 transmitter.  The battery monitor/alarm devices shall be mounted close to the batteries, and shall be incorporated with the designed kit.  All battery monitor/alarm cables shall be flexible and have enough length/slack to accommodate kit removal as described herein.  The battery monitor/alarm shall receive its input power from the batteries they monitor.  The battery monitor/alarm device alarm thresholds shall be field adjustable, and remain constant even after power interruption to the device.  If input power is interrupted to the battery monitor/alarm device, then reapplied, the device shall return to normal operations automatically, alarming at the previously adjusted for alarm thresholds.  The battery monitor/alarm device can have a Liquid Crystal Display for on-site technician recording of battery monitoring parameters, but is not required.  All mounting plates, bolts, washers, nuts and additional metallic installation hardware shall be 316 stainless steel.  Angle brackets if used shall be powder coated steel.  
5.1.1.  Installation Design Plan (IDP).  The contractor shall develop an IDP for the Phase I battery charger installation kit.  The IDP shall describe how to install the package, to include pictures and text to be understood by a novice electronic technician.  The IDP shall include a list of tools and parts needed for installation by a novice technician. The IDP shall also include a list of all installation kit parts and components (with quantities, manufacturer nomenclatures, manufacturer model/parts numbers and costs of each), including battery chargers; battery monitor/alarm devices; power panel and  circuit breakers; wire and cables (including their size and specifications); size, material description (316 stainless steel for example) and style (hex head, slotted, or pan screw heads for example) of mounting hardware; size of mounting plates and shelves (if used); and all other parts.  The IDP shall include a schematic, and block diagram drawing of the battery charger installation kit, showing the electrical equipment and their integration with each other that can be inserted as-is into the Coast Guard As-Built DGPS Site drawings.  The IDP shall include the following as a minimum:  Drawings of all cables, Equipment interconnecting diagrams (may be included as one drawing); Equipment block diagrams; Elevation diagrams indicating the locations of each piece of equipment to be installed; and parts lists.
5.1.2  Incorporation of Fixes to Production System.  The contractor shall incorporate any fixes developed from the Phase I acceptance and review period into all production systems. 
5.1.3  Phase II Kit Production.  The Contractor shall produce 68 battery charger installation kits once the Phase I kit is provided and passes acceptance testing by the Government.

<DESC>The following Request for Information (RFI) is modified to change the response date:  The Naval Air Systems Command Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA209) is requesting industry information regarding mass memory data transfer and recording to achieve Tactical Aircraft Moving Map (TAMMAC) functionality on current production Navy and Marine Corps aircraft such as the F/A-18E/F, UH-1Y, AH-1Z, and MH-60, and legacy Navy and Marine Corps aircraft such as the F/A-18C/D and AV-8B as well as F/A-18 Foreign Military Sales (FMS). This Request for Information (RFI) requests technical information on the capabilities of memory units within industry and on future developmental efforts.  The information obtained will be used to determine the availability of a memory unit (MU) with the potential to meet the stated objectives for use in the aircraft specified above to support the possibility of a full and open competition.   The desired objectives of the MU are to: 1) execute aircraft specific user-developed programs directly from a Type II PCMCIA card, loaded from a Type II PCMCIA Card into the MU, or residing as a software module in the MU;  2) interface over a HSI bus to a digital map computer through both copper wire and fibre optics;  3) have a minimum of 2 PCMCIA card slots, one dedicated to maintenance data download from MIL-STD 1553 MUX bus and theatre map upload to map computer and the other slot for mission data communication; 4) load/record classified information from/to the mission card utilizing an independent volatile memory buffer inside the MU; 5) perform secure erase of mission memory and mission card in accordance with TAMMAC Security Requirements Document/Traceability Matrix and at a rate not less than 100 Mbytes/second; 6) satisfy existing program form, fit, function, and interface (F3I) integration and commonality requirements; 7) become a bus controller performing aircraft system OFP loads emulating the Mission Loader Verifier Set (MLVS);  8) utilize both COTS and Rugedized PCMCIA cards; 9) be compliant with MIL-STD-461E for EMI/EMC; 10) be compliant with all versions of Windows 2000, ME, XP, 98 and 95 operating systems  allowing the unit to read/write data from/to a card formatted on all Navy ground mission planning or maintenance workstations having either internal or external PCMCIA card reader/writers. The MU will be supported by an Organizational to Commercial Depot maintenance philosophy with the potential of establishing an organic depot using a teaming arrangement. Current Navy planning necessitates memory units be available for procurement in FY05 to FY09 and beyond with installation beginning in FY06. An estimated 1200 units will be procured for the remainder of this program.  The response should include, but not be limited to, the following:  a) A one page company history description to include:  Small Business Administration (SBA) business size classification, major products, primary customer base, and points of contacts and their telephone numbers, that are able to discuss the material submitted; b) product descriptions.  Include plans for growth utilizing new technology innovations such as 64-bit processor and bus, 3.3V compatibility, PCI-X bus and easily upgradeable memory. Also, ability to read, write and store multi-channel video and voice data; c) logistics support and affordable readiness concepts, predicted/actual memory unit MTBF and warranties; d) Past experience with MIL-STD-1553 and HSI fibre channel data bus architecture and implementations; e) Other communication I/Os (RS-422, RS-485, Ethernet, Arinc 429/575, HSDN, fiber channel switched fabric topology, etc) available with these memory units.  Interested parties should provide budgetary pricing and product information for this RFI no later than 21 July 2003.  If the material provided contains proprietary information, please mark and identify disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned).   Address responses to:  Naval Air Systems Command, 47123 Buse Road, Unit IPT, Suite 256, Attn:  Janine Stratakes, Air-2.4.2.4.1, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1547 or submit electronically to the original POC below.   This RFI does not in any way constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and as such, is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice nor otherwise pay for information requested. The Respondents may not be notified of the results of the Navys review of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website.  It is the responsibility of the potential offeror to monitor Federal Business Opportunities for the release of any follow-on information.

<DESC>NA THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: 1)       Are you looking for custom software or software that is off-the-shelf?  Users should be able to use standard software (e.g. web browser and PDF reader) to access the information.  2)       Do you prefer the software to be installed at your facilities on your hardware or have the software hosted at our data center? Prefer system be hosted outside our facilities, and accessed via Internet. If installed at your facilities, what is your preferred platform and database (i.e. Windows, UNIX, Oracle, etc.)? 3)       What are the primary uses for the Internet Services? You stated in the solicitation that you wanted various functionality such as text search, viewing, printing of various catalog information, but what is this information used for (i.e. placing or ders, document management, supply chain management, etc.)? Technical data and documents to be used for engineering and logistics support, supply chain management, and document managment.  4. Who are the users of the system?  Natick personnel are the users.  First, throughout the document there are references to DoD Specs and standards documents. Is there a way to reference these? Mil specs and standards documents can be referenced via the Defense Standardization Program (DSP) and the Document Automation and Production Service (DAPS).  They are available to the public as well a s government users.  Second, at first glance your requirements seem to be well within the operational specs of even a shared web server. Do you require a dedicated server for this application? No.  Are there any security concerns beyond those that would be addressed by running a civilian SSL server?  The data is not classified.  There are the normal security concerns for running applications accessed via the Internet, and we want access to the service to be password-protected.  Third, in what form will the catalogs reach us? We are obviously building/deploying a database here, and there is a vast difference between creating one from a paper catalog and converting an existing one (or more) for the web.  Either hard copy or electronic source for catalog information could be used by vendor to build the database. Finally, we specialists in Open Source development,  and our tools of choice for a project like this are a combination of Apache, MYSQL, and PHP on the Linux platform. Are there any reasons that this would be a problem for you?  No.  Our requirement is that users be able to access, search, view documents via the Internet using their PCs.    ____________________________________________________________________________

<DESC>This serves as a sources sought notice and market survey to locate qualified small businesses capable of performing distance learning services for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).  FSIS requires contractual support services to develop the distance learning component of training and education courses that address scientific, public health, management and regulatory topics that are tailored to the needs of FSIS.  The classroom courses must be tailored to meet the needs of FSIS and focused on public health curriculum.  The type of services covered under this proposed effort are as follows:  1) Convert courses currently delivered by classroom methods into a format that can be delivered through distance learning to our geographically dispersed workforce; 2)  Provide a link between the courses offered by distance learning and the learning management system used by FSIS so that the Agency can track course registration, course delivery, and completion; 3)  Ensure an ongoing and effective connection between any platform used to host distance learning courses and the electronic systems used by FSIS employees to ensure that distance learning courses are easily accessible to the workforce; 4)  Develop materials to support distance learning (e.g., user's guide, administrator's guide) on accessing the Contractor's learning management system if it is different than the system used by FSIS; 5) Provide continuing education credit through the distance learning program; and 6) linking distance learning courses to widely recognized credentials in a format that can be delivered through distance learning to our geographically dispersed workforce. Subject matter experts may be required in order to convert traditional print-based classroom training courses to a distance learning method.  Classroom courses that may be converted may focus on:  1) Scientific, public health, and regulatory education and training; 2) Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) technical and regulatory approaches; and  3) Courses targeted to meet the needs of specific occupational groups within the Agency (Consumer Safety Inspector, Frontline Field Supervisor, Consumer Safety Officer, Compliance Officer, etc.).  Small businesses having the capabilities necessary to provide the described services are invited to submit appropriate documentation which will demonstrate that it has the ability to perform this service.  This information will allow the Government to determine whether small business concerns can satisfy the Government's requirement and whether the procurement should be set-aside for small businesses. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 611430, Professional and Management Development Training, and the small business size standard is $6 million in average annual receipts.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.  The Government is not requesting technical/management proposals and no contract will be awarded as a result of this sources sought notice.  Your responses will be used solely for market research purposes of the Government.  The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this synopsis and submittals will not be returned to the sender.  A draft RFP will be released on or about August 11 for industry comment.  All comments must be received by the same date and time indicated for the sources sought response.  If a final solicitation is later released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any synopsis or solicitation.  Interested small businesses are requested to submit a package delineating qualifications, capabilities, and experience for meeting the range of services described herein.  Include information on your company's managerial and technical resources to be able to meet the requirements.  Companies must sufficiently demonstrate that they have the capability to perform this service and must provide detailed experience and qualifications in all previous work pertinent to this effort.  Responses should also include the following:  name and address of firm; size of business; number of years in business; and list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, and point of contact with address and phone number).

These activities shall include product forecasting, ordering, warehousing, inventory control, transportation, management oversight and dedicated customer service support.  The types of hazardous commodities included under this program are defined in FED-STD-313D. All stock classes listed in Table I and some of the stock classes listed in Table II (as to be determined by the government) of FED-STD-313D shall be included in the Prime Vendor Support Program.  This program will include an option to extend the prime vendor responsibilities down to the pharmacies and point of use containers.   The attached Requirements Sheet provides additional information relative to this program.   
On the morning of the first day we will convene an open session for general discussion on issues and concerns.  Beginning that afternoon and continuing into the next morning we will schedule one-on-one sessions with each vendor interested in discussing specific issues and concerns relative to their company's interests.  Each vendor will be allowed 20 minutes of discussion time for the closed sessions.  Sessions will be scheduled on a first come-first-served basis.  If your company is interested in participating in the subject Industry Day, please contact Mr. Mark Leslein at (478) 926-0281 for detailed information on the Industry Day Venue and associated information regarding base access, parking, and local area information or to schedule a one-on-one session with the government team.  Due to the expected level of interest in the program, we are limiting company participation to just two representatives each.  Note:  Bundling considerations are yet to be addressed finalized for this acquisition.

<SUBJECT>A -- Identification, Characterization and Development of Inhibitors of the p53 Tumor Suppressor Protein
<DESC>The tumor suppressor protein, p53, is an important component of the cellular machinery that responds to genotoxic stresses, and acts as an "emergency brake" to maintain genomic integrity by either arresting the cell cycle or by inducing a form of programmed cell death termed apoptosis.  The value that p53 activation plays in protecting proliferative cells from passing on genetic instability by inducing apoptotic cell death is counterbalanced by the disadvantage caused by the same machinery in non-proliferative, end-differentiated cells (such as neurons) that cannot be replaced. For example, a large component of the cellular death involved in stroke, brain trauma, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and heart disease involves the activation of a final common cascade of biochemical and cellular events for which p53 is a gatekeeper. In this regard, novel small compounds have been synthesized that potently inhibit the activation of p53 caused by a toxic and usually lethal insult, to thereby protect cells from dying.  

The NIA seeks a CRADA Collaborator to develop p53 -inhibiting compounds with drug-like characteristics for clinical assessment and to identify and characterize human diseases which would most benefit from transient inactivation of p53.

Potential Areas of Application
·	Possible therapeutic use of p53 inactivators to inhibit cell death associated with brain trauma, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and heart disease.

Main Advantages of Technology/Invention
·	The inhibitors preserve dopaminergic neurons and motor function in experimental Parkinsonism.

Current State of Development
·	Several p53-inhibiting compounds have been synthesized and shown to inhibit apoptosis.

Further R&D Required
·	Pre-clinical and clinical development
·	Develop a strategy to determine for which human diseases transient inactivation of p53 is most beneficial.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Advanced Microscopy Techniques Stepper Motor Stage Automation Systems for JEOL Scanning Electron Microscopes
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Electromagnetic Technology Division (ETD) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corp., 3 Electronics Ave., Danvers, MA for a quantity of two (2) Sprite stage automation systems.  The purpose of the acquisition is to retrofit stepper motor stage automation systems onto two older scanning electron microscopes (SEM), a JEOL Model 6400 and a JEOL Model 848, that are used for both imaging and electron beam lithography.  JEOL does not provide retrofits or upgrades on the stage control on its microscopes.  Market research found that  JEOL refers customers to Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corp for these requirements.  Compatibility with ETD's existing electron beam lithography system is also required.  Market research could find no other retrofit stage automation that has been successfully interfaced with the Nanometer Pattern Generation System (NPGS) manufactured by JC Nabity Lithography Systems.  No solicitation is available.  This small purchase (NTE $100K) is being conducted under the authority of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items.  Responses to this Notice will be evaluated solely to determine if a competitive acquisition procedure would be in the best interests of the Government.  Written responses to this Notice should be directed to the attention of Michelle Sandoval, Purchasing Agent, via e-mail (Michelle.Sandoval@noaa.gov) or fax  (303)497-3163.

<SUBJECT>--Vapor Sorption System IGA-002 to include: IG2-6 Computer, IG3-6 Refrig. recirc. bath, IG3-5.1 Liquid Nitrogen BET Jacket and software upgrade, IG2-5 Floor Mounting frame, IG2-4B Turbomolecular pump station, Installation and training.
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division has a requirement to purchase a Vapor Sorption System IGA-002.    The Government anticipates awarding a firm fixed price purchase order to HIDEN Analytical, Inc., Peterborough, NH.   HIDEN Analytical Inc. is the only supplier of this type of system, which is a custom made system. They are the only known company that can put together the appropriate combination of hardware and software to make the system unique. In the past we have tr ied to put together similar systems from individual components, which did not work. Their system will provided us with the capabilities of a self-enclosed temperature controlled and vacuum environment to obtain precise measurements of adsorption over a var iety of chemicals and materials.  The HIDEN IGS-002 Sorption system for vapor generation will be capable of maintaining very low vapor pressures over an extended period time.  Correspondingly, vacuum leakage will be negligible over that time period.  Using  IGA-002s method, there is no carrier gas or mass flow controllers.  The IGA system can set and control pressures for several days without a problem and is able to run in the automated isotherm mode.  The IGA-002 balance does not suffer from contact with o rganic solvents.  It is PTFE coated and does not contain any Duco Cement as it is with the Cahn balance where attachments are made with Duco cement.  This system also measures sorption isotherms of food products.    There are no other known companies that can meet the Governments needs.  Delivery shall be F.O.B. Destination.  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) for this procurement is 3826.  Questions concerning this synopsis can be directed to Michelle Miller at Michelle.Marie.Miller@us.army.mil.   Inquiries shall be made no later than 22 August 2003.

   FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: September 5,2003
4. POSITION TITLE: Private Sector Advisor – USAID/Kosovo
5. MARKET VALUE: $72,381.00 - $94,098.00 per annum (GS 14 – equivalent) 
6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: November 2003- November 2004
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo 
8. POSITION DESCRIPTION: 

   A. Basic Function of the position: 

Based in Pristina, the PSC Private Sector Advisor will be assigned to the USAID Economic Restructuring Office and will be responsible for development and oversight of economic growth policies and projects related to the development of productive enterprises.  Stimulation of productive enterprises is critical to the achievement of USAID objectives in Kosovo.  These programs command a significant share of development resources allocated to USAID programs and include sizeable teams of technical assistance.  

The PSC Private Sector Advisor will report to senior management in Pristina, via the Director of the Economic Restructuring Office, on technical and policy matters related to development of productive enterprises as well as on program management and coordination issues.  The Private Sector Advisor will be responsible for oversight of activities and processes related to the planning, design and implementation of programs related to stimulation of productive enterprises, which may include but is not limited to: investment, trade development, competitiveness and/or employment generation.  The initial period of service is one year, with the possibility of extension for a second year based on mutual consent.

As one of the Mission’s senior-level advisors on productive enterprises development, the Private Sector Advisor will exercise significant independent judgment on matters of policy and technical direction, and will make decisions that ensure successful program implementation.  He/she will report frequently to senior Mission management and will advise senior-level U. S. Office Pristina, donor and host government officials on economic policy, institutional reform and USAID support strategy, program priorities and program directions.

I.  Background

Since the end of the conflict in 1999, the political administration in Kosovo has been represented by the U.N. Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).  The Constitutional Framework, established in 2001, provides for a division of political and economic decision-making authority between the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG), which represent the elected Government of Kosovo and those institutions which report to the Office of the Special Representative to the Secretary General (SRSG).  In the economic sphere, decision-making authority in areas of fiscal policy and administration, trade and investment, and commercial law are generally considered transferred powers.  The areas of privatization, public enterprise management, utilities regulation (other than telecommunications), and banking regulation, are generally under the direct control of the SRSG wing of UNMIK.  Coordination on economic policy and institutional matters between the PISG and SRSG is handled through the operation of the Economic and Fiscal Council, a consultative body composed of representatives from both wings of the UNMIK Government.

Over the last four years, Kosovo has had to recover from a significant reduction in living standards and employment opportunities associated with two distinct phenomena.  First, the NATO conflict in 1999 and associated paramilitary violence caused significant infrastructure damage, particularly in the telecommunications and housing sectors.  It resulted in massive refugee flows, which completely disrupted economic livelihood activities.  The most urgent impact of the conflict was felt in the agricultural sector, which contributed approximately one-third of GDP and over one-half of total employment.

Second, for the decade before the conflict, Kosovo was subject to a network of discriminatory laws and essentially neo-colonial economic policies by Serbia.  Under this system Kosovar Albanians were dismissed in mass from state jobs in both the public administration and state industry spheres.  Large numbers of housing units were turned over to Serbs, with resulting displacement of the prior Albanian residents.  The provision of public services became virtually exclusively geared toward the needs of the minority.

Thus, economic restructuring in Kosovo faces many challenges.  Nevertheless, since 1999, economic recovery and expansion has proceeded rapidly in Kosovo.  USAID’s Economic Restructuring Office developed a post crisis strategy that focused on fiscal policy and administration, financial sector oversight, legal framework, and creating a market-driven economy.  
With USAID help, the Ministry of Finance and Economy is developing into a strong institution.  Fiscal decentralization is well underway through a system of intergovernmental finance that decentralizes tax, budget and treasury functions to municipalities, including full implementation of a property tax.  USAID helped develop the Banking and Payments Authority into a strong regulatory institution—regulating the banking, insurance and pension sectors.  These reforms laid the foundation for the development of a banking system that has reintegrated the savings and investment decisions of the Kosovar population back into the formal financial system. 

With USAID assistance, the development of priority commercial legislation now provides the foundation for a legal environment conducive to private investment and entrepreneurship.  A legal framework is now in place that protects basic property and contractual rights of both domestic citizens and businesses and foreign investors, creates a low–cost environment for establishing and operating a business.  In addition a comprehensive legal framework for privatization of industrial enterprises is in place and privatization has begun.  In the trade area, an effective policy and administrative regime is evolving, including an efficient customs administration.  This is beginning to promote open trade flows, the lifeline of the Kosovar economy. 
 
USAID’s Economic Restructuring Office has also placed considerable resources into accelerating the growth of the private sector through activities working with Kosovar businesses.  However, while overall progress in this area has been considerable, the private sector is not yet driving job creation and Kosovo continues to experience high levels of unemployment and underemployment.
Many of Kosovo’s enterprises are small traders geared toward servicing the international donor community and are not positioned to aggressively pursue export opportunities.  The great need in the private sector is to help Kosovo develop competitive industries producing goods that are marketable domestically as well as regionally.  This, in turn, will result in increased employment.  However, building competitive industries still faces many challenges.
Local agriculture and manufacturing enterprises have not attained production or industry standards that are acceptable for exporting goods to developed economies, or to substitute their goods for an enormous volume of imports.  A dearth of advanced technology, fueled by insufficient credit for capital assets, contributes to this circumstance.  There is a widespread lack of essential business skills such as strategic planning, financial analysis, and organizational and operational management.  Kosovar managers and entrepreneurs often do not have access to market information, industry trends or buyer and supplier networks that are vital to creating and managing competitive businesses. 
Kosovo is not well-integrated into trade regimes.  Kosovo is not included in free trade arrangements recently concluded between Serbia and Montenegro and countries in the region.  Further, Kosovo continues to face discriminatory trade practices from neighboring countries.  Since trade integration is integral to Kosovo’s economic growth, a main focus of future assistance will be facilitating this integration.  Improvements in the trade regime may involve making Kosovo’s laws WTO-compliant and working with institutions to improve trade relations.  Essential elements in stimulating business and agribusiness in Kosovo will be efforts to expand Kosovo’s economic space and create or reestablish vibrant trade relationships and export opportunities.

Effective professional and trade associations are still in their infancy and are not yet strong advocates for the private sector.  Advocacy organizations, self-regulatory organizations, and other professional associations must be further developed in order to encourage and strengthen public-private dialogue and policy debates in order to promote a supportive enabling environment for investment.  Increasing their capacity will be essential if the business operating environment is expected to reflect sound commercial principals and facilitate increased investment and efficient operations.  

Access to credit is restricted, often because of a perceived high level of market risk and even short-term credit to finance purchases of inventory and raw materials requires high collateral.  In addition, although banks are liquid, long-term finance for capital assets is almost non-existent.  This is driven by such factors as short credit histories among local enterprises, weak rule of law, informal employment arrangements, and a lack of experience among banks in collecting on securitized collateral.  This is exacerbated by the inability of most enterprises to independently produce coherent business plans, market research, financial forecasts, and other analysis required by potential lenders.

The agricultural sector, which contributes roughly one-third of GDP, is one of Kosovo’s main employers and thus cannot be ignored in efforts to increase private sector growth.  Initiatives designed to increase competitiveness in agribusiness industries must address several major needs and facilitate not only increased production, but also enhanced product quality, improved processing, efficient use of resources, and expanded market opportunities.  Gains in agricultural efficiency will also lead to increased import substitution and create internal pressure for improvements in the trade regime to exploit export opportunities.  Significant improvements in agricultural efficiency will also require more appropriate credit structures.  
Overall Objective: Based in Pristina, the Private Sector Advisor will be assigned to the USAID Economic Restructuring Office and will be responsible for development and oversight of economic growth policies and projects related to the development of productive enterprises through trade promotion, investment and competitiveness, for all USAID programs, and for related programs/projects within the Economic Restructuring Office. Economic growth policies and programs are critical to the achievement of USAID’s objectives in Kosovo. These programs command a significant share of development resources of all USAID programs, and include sizeable teams of technical assistance.   
 
S/he will report to senior management in Pristina via the Director of the Economic Restructuring Office on technical and policy matters related to SME development, trade and competitiveness, and on program management and coordination issues.  The Program Manager will be responsible for oversight of activities and processes related to the planning, design, and implementation of economic growth-related programs.  The initial period of service is one year, with the possibility of extension for a second year, based on mutual consent.

    (1) The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

    (2) In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT-C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received, MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required, MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.

ADD: VOYAGE CHARTER FORCE PROTECTION.
