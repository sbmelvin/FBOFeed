<SOLNBR>DHHS-ORDC-DDA-05-12
<CONTACT>Rodney Cartwright, Contracting Specialist, Phone 202-205-5751, Fax 202-205-6092, Email rodney.cartwright@hhs.gov - David Beck, Chief Contracting Officer, Phone 202-205-5639, Fax 202-690-7412, Email david.beck@hhs.gov
<DESC>BACKGROUND:  The National Response Plan designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical responses to man-made or natural disasters.  The HHS Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP) was established in 2002.  This office holds responsibility for implementation of a comprehensive HHS strategy to protect the American population from, and be prepared to respond to, acts of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies.  Specifically, the Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) within OPHEP has the responsibility within HHS to contract with industry for large-scale manufacturing and delivery of licensable products to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) in preparation for a public health emergency response.  
DESCRIPTION:   The purpose of this notice is to indicate that HHS anticipates publishing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for acquisition of product on or after December 5, 2005.  The Department of Health and Human Services has a requirement for the acquisition and maintenance of therapeutic products to mitigate and/or treat the hematopoietic disruptions associated with Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS).  ARS, also referred to as radiation sickness, is an acute illness caused by radiation delivered to the whole body (or a large proportion of the body) over a period of seconds to days. In addition ingested, inhaled, or absorbed radioisotopes could also produce ARS. There are several blood-cell types that are primarily affected in ARS including white cells (neutrophils and lymphocytes), red cells, and platelets.  The significant decrease of neutrophils (called neutropenia) significantly increases an individual’s susceptibility to lethal infections.  Severe thrombocytopenia and anemia, (a lack of platelets and red blood cells respectively) can significantly increase an individual’s risk for bleeding (at platelet levels <20,000/uL) or tissue ischemia due to loss of oxygen carrying capacity, respectively.  The current requirement is for the acquisition of up to 100,000 treatment courses of medical countermeasures to mitigate and/or treat the hematopoietic syndrome associated with ARS; THE TREATMENTS TO BE ACQUIRED MUST MITIGATE AND/OR TREAT NEUTROPENIA. Following whole body radiation exposure in the 2 – 6 Gy range, treatment of neutropenia is the most critical clinical requirement and thus Offerors’ product(s) must mitigate and/or treat neutropenia associated with ARS. Medical countermeasures that both treat and/or mitigate the other components of the hematopoetic syndrome and/or the gastrointestinal syndrome of ARS are of interest to the USG. The gastrointestinal syndrome facilitates the transmigration of the intestinal flora placing patients with neutropenia at increased risk of life-threatening bacteremia and sepsis.  The Technical Evaluation Criteria to be published in the RFP will establish a scoring system whereby those products that can address additional components of ARS in addition to neutropenia (including thrombocytopenia, anemia, lymphopenia, GI syndrome, etc.) will be given additional points.  This acquisition is based on the availability of funds.
  
The RFP to be issued will be on the basis of full and open competition.  Subcontracting with small and small disadvantaged business is encouraged.  All Offerors with a candidate product or products for the mitigation and/or treatment of neutropenia alone or neutropenia in combination with one or more additional components of ARS that meet the Mandatory Criteria for Eligibility specified in the RFP are encouraged to submit a proposal in response to the RFP.  
The Mandatory Criteria for Eligibility will include:
Product(s) that treat the neutropenia associated with ARS.  Neutropenia will be defined as a reduction in neutrophils (granulocytes) meeting one of the following criteria:
•	Moderate <1000 neutrophils/uL
•	Severe <500 neutrophils/uL
The Government reserves the right to make single or multiple contract awards.  It is anticipated that up to an additional 100,000 treatment courses may be acquired under SEPARATE RFP(s) at a later date, contingent on the availability of funds.  
The RFP will be released on GSA FEDBIZOPPS website (www.fbo.gov).  No telephone requests will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.
