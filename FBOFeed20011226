The building is approximately 13,000 gross square meters (140,000 gross square feet) including 33 interior parking spaces, at a site located within or immediately adjacent to the Central Business District of Rockford, IL.  The Estimated construction cost range is $30 million to $40 million.  The facility will be designed in hard metric units.  The scope of work will require at a minimum: metric construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a Federal Courthouse that includes the construction of the new building and related systems, both site and indoor parking, site development, client program development, and socio-economic and sustainable program features.  This building will also include GSA design standards for secure courthouses.  This building will be an anchor development in the neighborhood and should make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the overall urban design and quality of life in this burgeoning mixed-use neighborhood.  This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The A/E firm, as used in this RFQ, is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility for the design concept and the building?s architecture.  The A/E Firm must clearly define the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and its ability to manage the design and production of construction documents.  The government will not allow payment for travel, living expense, computer time or hookups for the prime or the consultants related to meeting the requirements of this RFQ.  The A/E selection will be completed in three stages, as follows: In Stage I, an interested firm will submit a portfolio of accomplishments to establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8 1/2? x 11? format.  The Stage I submission should include the following: A) a cover letter referencing the CBD announcement and briefly describing the firm, its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; B) Standard Form 254 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire) and Standard Form 255 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project) modified to include only the A/E?s information (Identification of consultants is not required at this stage) and C) a design portfolio which is to include the following submission requirements and evaluation criteria: (1) Lead Designer Portfolio (35% of evaluated score): Submit a portfolio representative of the Lead Designer?s ability to provide design excellence.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

<SUBJECT>A--Pre-Solicitation Notice for Financial Assistance Applications for Advanced Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) On-Board Storage System
<SOLNBR>DE-SC02-02CH11108
<RESPDATE>
<ARCHDATE>
<CONTACT>Cynthia Anderson, Contracting Officer, 630-252-2844, cynthia.anderson@ch.doe.gov;Sharon Donaldson, Contract Specialist, 630-252-0953, sharon.donaldson@ch.doe.gov
<DESC>DOE intends to issue a Financial Assistance Solicitation in February 2002 for research and development in the area of Advanced Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) Onboard Storage Systems.    An Advanced LNG Storage System incorporates the use of a fuel pump. LNG fuel pumps are currently being used on high-pressure (3600 psig) direct injected natural gas engines. There are, however, advantages to using LNG pumps for all types of engines, since 25% more natural gas can be stored in a tank when fuel tank saturation pressure is below 15 psig. The lower pressure of the vehicle's storage tank also helps standardize and simplify the operation of the natural gas refueling station. Operating at low pressures can also reduce venting losses and may offer savings in equipment costs. The major obstacle to low-pressure onboard storage is the availability of a highly reliable in-tank LNG pump. DOE, therefore, has interest in an R&D test program that further develops low-pressure onboard LNG pumping capability. The long-term goal is to demonstrate cryogenic tank and pump systems that have commercial potential. The short-term goal is to validate cryogenic pumping design concepts through a laboratory proof-of-concept test program. Interested parties will be required to address the following program requirements: type of refueling (either single line fill or two line fill); thermal/pressure tank management; fuel weathering; fuel delivery sufficient for a 425-hp engine; cryogenic pump durability and maintenance schedule; tank hold time; redundancy in case of pump failure; business plan; and safety. It is DOE's intent to evaluate submitted designs and business plans, and support the further testing of the most promising approaches. The scope of work for the solicitation will be in two phases. Phase I activities will involve the "proof of concept" through a validation test program. Tasks under this phase will cover: construction of a test stand; fabrication of test items; component testing; pilot testing of a complete fuel delivery system; redesign and optimization; and prototype testing. Phase II activities will involve tank certification testing and road testing. (Phase II funding will be based on availability of funds, test data, design and market plan.) It is anticipated that the above efforts will take place over a twenty-four month period under a cooperative agreement arrangement. One or two cooperative agreements will result from the solicitation. Total Government funding is expected to be approximately $1,000,000.00. Successful applicants are expected to cost-share a minimum of 30% of the project cost. Technical program requirements include (1) low-pressure (15 psig or less) on-board storage, and (2) a no-vent system, both on station refuel and fuel delivery to the engine. It is anticipated that award(s) as a result of the solicitation will be made in July, 2002. It is further anticipated that Phase II funding for this project will be available in the FY 2003 budget. The solicitation, when issued, will include a narrative statement of work, program requirements, qualification criteria, evaluation criteria, and other information. The solicitation and any amendments will be available on DOE's "Industry Interactive Procurement System" (IIPS) Web page located at http://e-center.doe.gov on or about February 15, 2002. Prospective applicants can obtain access to the solicitation from the above Internet address or through the DOE Chicago Operations Office (CH) Internet address at http://www.ch.doe.gov under "current solicitations". All applications must be submitted through IIPS in accordance with the instructions provided in the solicitation.  At the above IIPS Internet page, you will also be able to register with IIPS, enabling you to submit an application.

The associated North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) for this procurement is 325998 and the size standard is 500 employees.  SCHEDULE: The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis (LHBP) has a requirement for peptide libraries consisting of 19-amino acid, biotin-labeled peptides. The LHBP has identified, through genome-scale approaches, a large number of proteins involved in the pathogenesis of infections caused by Group A Streptococcus  (GAS).  These peptides will be used to identify specific regions of these proteins recognized by the host immune system with the long-term goal of identifying GAS vaccine candidates.  We anticipate the need to order an average of approximately 700 peptides per month for a period of 12 months.  It is mandatory that the peptide libraries purchased have the following features: 1) The individual peptides must be synthesized using multiple parallel synthesis on polyethylene pins in 8 x 12 96-sample blocks using multi-pin solid phase peptide synthesis technology to minimize costs and turn around time.  2) The resultant peptides must be biotinylated at the aminoterminus and must be synthesized with a 4-residue (S-G-S-G) spacer arm.  The synthesis technology must allow the peptides to be cleaved after synthesis on pins, synthesized in 1-5 mmol quantities, and supplied in the final form as lyophilized powder.  In addition, Mass Spectral Analysis must be performed on selected peptides as part of the quality control process.  3) The company that will supply  the peptide libraries must have the capability to synthesize and supply the peptide libraries within 4-5 weeks of the placement of the order.

<DESC>NA This is a sources sought market survey intended to determine if there are additional sources for an inertial navigation system called the Modular Azimuth Position System (MAPS) which consists primarily of a Dynamic Reference Unit Hybrid (DRUH) associated c ables and vehicle interface modules.  This effort is for the DRUH only which is the inertial navigation unit for the MAPS.  PM Firefinder uses the MAPS system to provide radar location (northing, easting) and azimuth orientation while the radars are moving  on the battlefield.  This requirement is for exercising the first option on an existing contract for upgrading 16 Dynamic Reference Units (DRUs) to the DRU Hybrid (DRUH) configuration.  These units are deployed in fielded Firefinder Units and depot locati ons worldwide.  In addition it is planned to procure 5 new DRUHs for integration into existing Firefinder radars which do not have the MAPS capability.  The MAPS is a major system developed by Honeywell Inc. that meets the Government's performance specific ation requirements.  Honeywell has been prequalified and is the Original Equipment Manufacture (OEM) and designer for the MAPS system.  Since the MAPS was bought under a performance specification developed by the Government, the Government does not hold th e data rights of the MAPS design.  For the requirement under this announcement, the contractor is responsible to insure that the upgraded/repaired MAPS are fully functional without technical input from the Government.  The contractor is also required to ob tain technical knowledge of the MAPS to provide engineering service to the Government when requested to include system integration and engineering feasibility studies.  In order to be considered responsive to this market survey, a vendor must submit inform ation sufficient for the Government to make a technical assessment of the capabilities of the proposed system.  POC is Mr. Dave Williamson, (732) 427-5919.
