<DESC>The goal of Pakistan Regional Economic Integration Activity (PREIA) is to increase access to international markets in order to enhance Pakistan's regional economic integration with its neighbors. By strengthening public and private sector capacities to implement trade policy reform and improving trade promotion and facilitation, PREIA aims to improve the trade environment, resulting in increased regional trade and transit flows. The new Activity has four planned focus areas: (i) improving the Government of Pakistan's (GOP) ability to develop and implement reforms to policies which affect trade;(ii) strengthening private sector and civil society's engagement in trade policy-making and its reform; (iii) improving regional trade and transit facilitation by Pakistan Customs; and (iv) improving regional business to business linkages. <br /> <br />The first two areas support broad improvements to the business enabling environment in Pakistan regarding trade, and the others support improved capacity for Pakistani businesses to access regional markets.  Trade associations, logistics firms, business associations, GOP ministries and regional counter-parts will increase access to markets through the negotiation and implementation of treaties and trade facilitation measures. As a result of assistance provided through PREIA, Pakistan will have improved capacity in the analysis of trade policy choices, and the private sector will be recognized as a key stakeholder in both policy making and implementation, with the ultimate aim of creating jobs and raising incomes.<br />

Commencing with the date of release of the Pre-solicitation notice published in fbo.gov, any potential Offeror may provide a frame selection chart to the Contract Specialist at the address identified below.  The frame chart provided for pre-approval must arrive no later than two (2) weeks prior to the solicitation closing date (to be established at the time of release of the solicitation).  From the frame chart provided the VA will select up to 100 frames that will be approved to be included in the Offer's approved sample kit.  

The chart shall include, but is not limited to, specifications of all frames, pictures and information about each frame. For each frame proposed, specify the name of manufacturer, frame style name, material classification, sizes, Colors, department (men's, women's, etc.) and name of distributor. No discontinued models or special "Medicaid" frames shall be permitted.  A minimum of 150 to 200 frame styles (not including color selection) shall be submitted for selection.

The Contract Specialist will assign a color code to identify the chart and will provide the color coded chart to a selection committee that includes experienced Opticians, Optometrist and Prosthetic Representatives who will evaluate all frame styles.  The committee will select up to 100 frames for inclusion in each color's approved sample kit. A final sample kit may include frames for approximately forty (40) different frame types for men, thirty (30) different frame types for women, twenty-five (25) unisex frames and five (5) safety frames.  At least 5 frames for both men and women must be deluxe frames.  The selection committee will provide each color's approved sample kit to the Contract Specialist and the Contract Specialist shall notify each Offeror of their approved sample kit.  The Offeror must base their pricing on their approved sample kit.  

If the selection committee cannot select sufficient frames to make up an approved sample kit the Offeror will be notified and will be provided an opportunity to provide additional frames for evaluation.  If the committee cannot identify sufficient frames to make up an approved sample kit the Offeror may be determined to be non-responsive.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Health Resource Center (HRC), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), located at 23 Christopher Way, Eatontown, New Jersey, intends to enter into a contract on a basis of other than full and open competition for existing Pipkins software maintenance and support for Pipkins Workforce Management (WFM) system.  WFM system is an integral part of any call center.  Pipkins software is already owned by VA and is currently integrated with the telephony system to combine historical data, forecasting, staffing and scheduling to develop optimized scheduling.  This allows HRC to adjust schedules so that they align with call volume, thereby allowing HRC to handle more calls.  Any WFM system must integrate with the existing telephony system.  The intended sole source award will be a firm-fixed price contract with Pipkins, Inc. 1 McBride and Son Center Drive, Suite 140, Chesterfield, MO 63005.  The Statutory Authority for this effort falls under Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  The North American Industrial Classification for this effort is 541519.  The estimated date of award for this action is March 11, 2015.  

This notice does not in itself represent the issuance of a formal request for proposal/quote and is not intended to be taken as such.  This notification shall close on February 18, 2015. 

Questions/responses shall be submitted via e-mail to Contract Specialist, Alma Aliaj, and e-mail: Alma.Aliaj@va.gov, with the subject line as the synopsis number, VA118-15-Q-0097.

Synopsis:


Please note that this is NOT a request for quotes or proposals. The Department of Veterans Affairs, Northport VA Medical Center is currently conducting a market survey for qualified firms capable of providing the listed items. 

The vendor will be responsible for, but not limited to providing the following brand name items:

Description									Quantity

Heine Omega 500 LEDHQ Unplugged with HC50L Ophthalmoscopes	4     



Objective

The objective of this requirement is to purchase wireless LED indirect ophthalmoscopes which can be used daily to examine patients and diagnose their eye condition.  


Requirements

The new instrument must have an adjustable headset for use by multiple physicians.  The illumination should be LED as this is more reliable and needs to be changed less frequently.  A wireless instrument that is then placed on a wall-mounted charger is needed because some patients with poor mobility cannot transfer to an exam chair or cannot come to the clinic at all to be examined with wired instrumentation that has a limited range.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement, for market survey information only, to be used for preliminary acquisition planning purposes. No proposals are being requested and none will be accepted in response to this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District is seeking market information in order to solicit and award five (5) Single Award Task Order Contracts (SATOCs) for construction to 8(a) firms in the Baltimore District area of responsibility.  The Baltimore District includes Maryland, the District of Columbia, and parts of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. The intention of these five SATOCs is to select the five most qualified 8(a) firms and assign them to a specific area of responsibility to both rapidly respond to Government requirements and to gain a better understanding of USACE contracting. The Government proposes to issue firm fixed price type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for this requirement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests. The purpose of this Market Research and Sources Sought Notice is to determine if there are adequate 8(a) contractors within the Baltimore District region to provide adequate competition to compete and perform a firm fixed price construction type contract.  <br>  <br> The purpose of this proposed contract is to execute primarily sustainability, renovation, and modernization construction and/or design work at five areas of responsibility which include Ft. Belvoir, Ft. Meade, Ft. Detrick, Aberdeen Proving Ground, and the Letterkenny Army Depot/ Harrisburg, PA area.  It is the Government's intention to assign one 8(a) firm to each of the specific areas of responsibility although task orders may be issued for other areas within the boundaries of the USACE-Baltimore District based upon need.  The scope of services under this proposed contract includes design-bid and design-bid-build work. Typical work may include but is not limited to repair and renovation of existing facilities potentially of the following types: industrial, distribution, manufacturing, office, retail, recreational, healthcare and commercial. Representative work examples may include general interior finish upgrades and space reconfiguration, electrical service improvements, roofing materials replacement, mechanical systems repair, storm drainage structure repair, plumbing repairs and improvements, walkways, etc. Work may also include some construction of new facilities. Representative work examples may include construction of small classroom facilities, toilet facilities, shelters, gazebos, etc. As requirements develop, Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for projects will be issued for each Task Order. Task Orders will include primarily Military Construction (MILCON), or Operations and Maintenance (O&M) projects.  <br>  <br> Task Orders will be negotiated to obtain a fair and reasonable price. Task Orders may range from $2,000 to $8,000,000. Each of the five (5) SATOC contracts are anticipated to consist of one (1) base year plus two (2) one year option years. The total contract capacity, comprised of the base year plus two option years, on each SATOC will not exceed $8 million.  <br>  <br> Prior experience with construction of ranges of similar scope will be required.  <br>  <br> Estimated construction range: Between $2,000 and $8,000,000.  <br>  <br> The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this acquisition is 236220.  <br>  <br> The Small Business Size Standard for this acquisition is $36.5 Million.  <br>  <br> Prior Government contract work is not required for submitting a response under this sources sought synopsis.  <br> Not all technical evaluation factors and subfactors have been established at this time. Past Performance will be evaluated.  <br>  <br> Offeror's response to this synopsis shall be limited to 5 pages and shall include the following information:  <br> 1) Firm's name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address;  <br> 2) Firm's interest in providing a proposal in response to the solicitation when it is issued;  <br> 3) Provide location of the firms' 8(a) business. <br> 4) Firm's capability to perform a contract of this magnitude and complexity (include firm's in-house capability to execute design-build and design-bid-build construction, comparable work performed within the past 5 years, brief description of the project, customer name, timeliness of performance, customer satisfaction, percentage of completion, and dollar value of the project).

DESCRIPTION / SPECIFICATIONS / STATEMENT OF WORK

A.	PURPOSE. 

The Department of Veteran Affairs, Phoenix VA Health Care System in, Phoenix, AZ requires contractors to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.  The goal of the HCHV program is to remove homeless Veterans from the street or habitation unfit for Veterans and place them in community-based, residential environments with sufficient therapeutic services to meet the needs of those Veterans.  Many transitional housing and other residential environments provide barriers to placement that may include maintaining a period of sobriety, no sexual offenders or other specific past felonies.  The need for a homeless transitional program that provides shelter for the severely mentally ill, disabled and aged Veteran is necessary. 

B.	BACKGROUND.

The Department of Veterans Affairs has established Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV), in accordance with 38 USC 1720A and Public Law 101-237. The Department of Veterans Affairs is implementing programs to end homelessness for veterans within five years. Existing housing programs provide transitional and permanent housing. This program will provide immediate and emergent housing for homeless veterans. The targeted population is homeless veterans who are severely mentally ill, disabled and/or aged. The contractor will provide case management and supportive services in collaboration with the VA contract liaison. The contractor will provide beds in a free standing facility or complex facilities that provide domicile and health related services, supportive program staff, and personal and/or protective care for veterans with or without substance use disorders. Contractor staff shall communicate information pertinent to resident's treatment to VA clinical staff. Contractor staff will participate in staff meetings during which their input regarding treatment decisions may be solicited. 

Admission Criteria for Placement in Transitional Housing: The contractor provides, one time only, the following clinical information along with an appropriate signed release: 

1.	Homeless
2.	Not a danger to self, others or property
3.	Capable of independently performing all activities of daily living (i.e. bathing, dressing, feeding one's self, managing any incontinence issues, etc.)
4.	Functionally and cognitively able of fleeing an emergency situation if needed
5.	Functionally and cognitively able to manage own medications
6.	Functionally and cognitively able to manage own home oxygen
7.	Medically cleared by the  VA provider

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Branch, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of Uninterrupted Power Source (UPS) Maintenance. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 811219 - Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance. The Small Business size standard is for NAICS 811219 is $20.5M.</p>
<p>The proposed source is Eaton Corporation, 8609 Six Forks Road, Raleigh, NC 27615-2966. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by&nbsp;8:30 am&nbsp;Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Tuesday, 17 Feb 15. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: Preventative and remedial maintenance is required on one (1) Eaton 9390 100KVA/90KW three phase UPS with two (2) matching battery cabinets rated for 61 minutes at 80 KW load. The Eaton UPS and battery cabinets contain proprietary firmware, and third party vendors would not be able to troubleshoot or run diagnostics on them. Therefore, Eaton is reasonably the only responsible source that can perform this effort.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>

<p><strong>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE</strong><br />The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) project aims to combine recordings of the electrical activity of single brain cells within and across cortical columns with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to better understand neural interactions at multiple spatial scales. In order to do so, the contractor, under the direction of NIMH, shall customize three (3) Matrix Arrays by replacing several metal components with polyether ether ketone (PEEK) and redesigning several key aspects to ensure compatibility in the fMRI environment.</p>
<p>1)	After NIMH provides the contractor with design specifications, the <br />purpose of the requirement is to procure a customized Matrix Array that <br />will allow NIMH:</p>
<p>a.	To describe neural activity sampled simultaneously from all layers of <br />several cortical columns within primary visual cortex and visual area 4 in extrastriate cortex.</p>
<p>b.	To describe, for the first time, interactions between laminar activity within <br />and between these areas.</p>
<p>c.	To observe and report differences (should they exist) in these patterns of <br />interactions as the brain responds to diverse visual stimuli.</p>
<p>d.	To describe, for the first time, patterns of correlations between the activity <br />of single neurons within specific layers of cerebral cortex and fMRI activity recorded throughout the brain.</p>
<p>e.	To observe and report differences (should they exist) in these patterns of <br />correlations as the brain responds to diverse visual stimuli.</p>
<p><br /><strong>PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br /></strong>Under the direction of NIMH and in accordance with their design specifications, the contractor shall provide:</p>
<p>CLIN 1</p>
<p>Three (3) Matrix Arrays (composed of the following parts)</p>
<p>a.	Two electrode arrays in each Matrix Array (64 electrodes apiece) arranged in a regularly spaced grid allowing NIMH to record from neurons within and between several cortical columns at 2 specified locations within the visual system of rhesus monkeys.</p>
<p>b.	One connector package for each Matrix Array that will be surgically implanted to facilitate data acquisition from each electrode contact.</p>
<p>c.	One primate pedestal for each Matrix Array that attaches to the connector package and anchors it to the primate skull allowing surgical implantation.</p>
<p><br />AND</p>
<p>One (1) IST-Matrix motor</p>
<p>a.	A micromanipulator that mounts to a standard surgical stereotaxic frame and holds the Matrix Array via a suction mechanism for surgical implantation without damage to neural tissue.</p>
<p><strong>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</strong><br />Delivery shall occur within one month after receipt of order<br /> <br /><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION<br /></strong>NIMH has indicated that there is a small community of researchers (probably fewer than 20 labs worldwide) who perform laminar electrode recordings in nonhuman primates. NIMH is very familiar with all of the research communities' work. NIMH program staff have read the papers that community members have written and the staff have spoken with many of them personally at meetings. This is how NIMH finds out about developing electrode technology.  In this field, new discoveries hinge on new technological advancements.  Therefore, NIMH is hyper aware of new electrode technology.</p>
<p>Through the community alluded to above, NIMH became aware of a new product in development by NeuroNexus and NIMH learned that it was being beta tested by 5 labs. This experimental product has since become commercially available. No other company besides Neuronexus currently manufactures a 3D array.</p>
<p>Due to the geometry of other manufacturers' arrays, it will not allow NIMH to record from multiple layers of cerebral cortex simultaneously.  That is one of the key requirements for this project.</p>
<p>NeuroNexus is the only company that is currently capable of making an MRI compatible micro-electrode array. This is the only company that currently makes a product allowing a volume of neural activity to be recorded in a grid formation.</p>
<p>The Contract Specialist performed further market research and contacted NueroNexus to further understand their unique ability to meet the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>A letter was obtained from NeuroNexus and the company indicated that they specialize in thin film technology and customizations. They further indicated that they can customize the electrode and the packaging, while delivering the arrays in a timely manner. Finally, NeuroNexus wrote that other companies do not offer thin film technology and customization abilities.</p>

<p><strong>CLOSING STATEMENT</strong><br />THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>All responses must be received by the closing date and time of this announcement and must reference the solicitation number. Responses may be submitted electronically to Shaun Miles, Contract Specialist, at shaun.miles@nih.gov. US Mail and Fax responses will not be accepted.</p>

<p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER N00164-12-D-WM45.</p>
<p>The Government awarded contract N00164-12-D-WM45, which is a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery,indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with a five year ordering period, to EON Instrumentation, Inc., 15531Cabrito Road STE A, Van Nuys, CA, 91406, on 17 April 2012 for Engineering Development Model (EDM)<br />minimum - one unit, maximum 3 units, low rate initial production (LRIP) minimum 0 units, maximum 24units of the pretrigger converter and blanking (PCAB) unit. Inspection and acceptance for the LRIP units is at destination (Crane IN, 47522) by a NSWC Government representative.</p>
<p>The current operating system (OS) used in the EDM and LRIP PCAB units is Windows XP embedded. It will not be supported on ship installations after the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. The new requirement is for the development of Windows 7 embedded OS and installation kit. The anticipated modification is to increase the contract ceiling to cover the development of the new OS and installation kit.</p>
<p>The original contract was negotiated with full and open competition after exclusion of sources. It was 100% set aside for small business. This modification will be negotiated on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)(a)(2)(iii) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The basis for restriction competition is: EON Instrumentation Inc., designed, developed and manufactured the EDMs<br />and LRIP units. The Government will not obtain the technical data package for the PCAB until after the LRIP phase is complete. Therefore, establishing alternative sources would result in unacceptable duplicative costs attempting to reverse engineer the LRIPs. It is the Governments intent to fully compete<br />the full rate production of the PCAB in a future procurement and the TDP will then include the Windows 7 OS requirement.</p>

<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with Waters Corporation to modify Task Order EP-G15C-00567 issued against GS-07F-0559X in order to purchase an atmospheric pressure gas chromatograph (APGC) and APGC interface compatible to the Waters Xevo G2XS Quadrupole/Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer (QToFMS).  The US EPA recently competitively purchased a Waters Xevo G2X QToFMS via aforementioned Task Order.  This item was pursued as an optional part on the acquisition of the Waters Xevo system; however, this item was not on the firm's GSA schedule.  As such, it is necessary to modify the order to add the APGC and comply with the requirements of 8.402(f)(1).  The nature of the acquisition requires a vendor that possesses the unique capabilities of supplying an APGC with an APGC interface that is compatible with the Waters Xevo G2XS QToFMS.
The APGC that has the software/hardware capability of connecting via the proprietary Waters APGC interface is only available through Waters Corporation. The specific interface required is not an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) interface, which can only couple a Liquid Chromatograph to the mass spectrometer, but is an APGC interface, allowing a GC to couple to the mass spectrometer, giving greater range of chemical classes that can be analyzed.  Finally, using a different gas chromatograph would invalidate the warranty on the Waters Xevo G2XS QToFMS.
This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 8, FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13 Procedures.  Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETATIVE QUOTATIONS.  Any firm that is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as set forth above may submit a response; which, if received within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be reviewed for consideration.  A determination not to compete the described requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses to this posting must be submitted via the FedConnect website at https://www.fedconnect.net.  Mail, fax, phone and email submissions shall not be accepted.  One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to Free Trade Agreements.  EPA anticipates that modification to the award will be made by March 5, 2015.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT: Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, it is the intent of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region 5 to award a sole source service contract to Blue Water Satellite, Inc. (BWS) in order to access and download data, which is gathered by BWS satellite imagery capabilities.  BWS has the capability to provide captured satellite images utilizing spectral reflected light, processed by using Blue Water Satellite?s patented algorithms to detect mineral and organic particle pollutants.   BWS measurements are highly accurate, verified by ground truthing, and have resolution varying from 5 measurements per acre to 1,000 measurements per acre.  This high density of data will aid the Government in understanding conditions that exist in the entire land or water area rather than having to rely on a small number of single point samples, a method which is considered less accurate and more costly. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541360, with a size standard of $15.0 million. THIS IS NOT A FORMAL SOLICITATION. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This synopsis is not considered a Request for Quotation or Proposal.  No solicitation document is available, and telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation will not be honored. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. Individual responses shall be limited to five (5) double sided 8 ? by 11 inch pages.  All responses received within 5 days will be considered. If no affirmative written response is received, the service contract will be awarded without further notice. Detailed capabilities of interested vendors must be submitted Mary Rankin at rankin.mary@epa.gov no later than 2:00 PM (CST) on February 23, 2015.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Notice Type:</strong></span> <br />Intent to Sole Source
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intended Awardee: <br /></span></strong>National Conference of State Legislature<br />7700 East First Place<br />Denver, CO 80230<br />Ph: 303.364.7700</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Title:</strong></span> <br />Child Support Enforcement State Legislature Support Project<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Solicitation#:</strong></span> <br />15-233-SOL-00121</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Date:</span></strong> <br />February 13th, 2015</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notice of Intent:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE), is to ensure that child support policies are properly implemented at the state level. The success of the federal Child Support Enforcement Program (e.g., ensuring that children receive financial support from their noncustodial parents) is contingent, In part, on the ability of state legislatures to establish correlating laws, policies/procedures and to appropriate funds that adhere to the federal program financial matching requirements. It is critical to the federal Child Support Enforcement program that state legislatures remain informed on current national issues, federal and key interstate law and changing program policies to enable child support agencies to build and maintain an infrastructure that ensures federal policies are implemented and programs perform, as required, to meet the needs of parents and children.<br /><br />The federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE), is authorized by statute (Section 452 (j) (1) of the Social Security Act) to: disseminate information to and conduct technical assistance to States, provide training of State and Federal staff, staffing studies, and related activities needed to improve the implementation of the Title IV-D child support enforcement program. As such, The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) is uniquely positioned, as the only official representative of all state legislatures, to perform authorized activities described in Section 452 (j) (1) on behalf of OCSE. NCSL is unique in that it is not a non- governmental organization working with the states, but rather it is by definition "an instrumentality of the fifty several states." Thus, contracting with NCSL is tantamount to contracting simultaneously with the 50 states. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As noted by the Internal Revenue Service:</span><br />NCSL was created by the state legislatures to help them improve their effectiveness and quality, to improve interstate cooperation and to provide the mechanism for developing collective policy positions on public issues. The organization acts as a collector and repository of information on issues of particular concern to the states. NCSL functions as an extension of the staff of the legislators.<br />Under a previous contract with OCSE, (Contract # HHSP233201100213A - expiration date 4/29/2014) NCSL developed the only national clearinghouse of state and federal child support statutory and policy information available to state legislators.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Background:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The current sequestration, rising state budget deficits, pending Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) reauthorization, the large number of newly- elected and new state legislators, and the complexity of child support program and policy issues necessitates the requirement to assist state legislatures with the immediate challenges before them (both fiscal and programmatic) as they relate to the continued viability of state child support enforcement programs. Additionally, legislative term limits and increasing turnover in state legislatures have resulted in a continuing need for education and the provision of reliable information on child support issues by non-partisan source.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three main purposes of this contract are 1) to keep state legislatures informed on current national issues (e.g., full family distribution), federal and key interstate laws, and changing program policies so that child support agencies can build and maintain an infrastructure that ensures federal policies are implemented and programs perform, as required, to meet needs of parents and children; 2) to have the NCSL participate in national and state meetings to continue to build upon established relationships with child support professionals and present at workshops to share the perspective of the legislature and to better connect child support professionals with state legislators; and 3) to include outreach to state legislators and state child support directors for customized technical assistance and to determine how they can work together to develop/implement the latest policies and practices in child support.<br /><br />These goals can be accomplished through the maintenance and enhancements of the NCSL clearinghouse on child support issues (e.g., policy, financing, family law database, child support 101, best practices, etc.). The clearinghouse was established during a recent contract with the NCSL between September 2011 - September 2013 and a 6-month no-cost extension through March 29, 2014. The option to have the NCSL participate in national and state child support meetings as presenter and/or participant and their ability to provide in-state assistance to legislators and state child support directors will provide OCSE the opportunity to obtain recommendations and experiences of legislators in developing effective communication strategies and appropriate guidance regarding federal requirements.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT: Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, it is the Government's intent to award a sole source service contract to OneRain Incorporated to access and download data, which is gathered by the StormLinkTM rain gauges.  The data is accessed through a webpage hosted by Contrail  Web.  The rain gauges were placed as part of an early warning system for communities affected by the Las Conchas fire of 2011.  At the time, this was the largest wildfire in New Mexico, burning more than 156,000 acres of forest on the eastern slopes of the Jemez Mountains and the Pajarito Plateau. <br>  <br> The loss of vegetation and unstable soil conditions justify the need for immediate action to be taken by contracting for data acquisition for the impending flood events.  Anticipated recent heavy rains and anticipated Spring runoffs exacerbated these problems. <br>  <br> THIS IS NOT A FORMAL SOLICITATION. <br>  <br> This synopsis is not considered a Request for Quotation or Proposal.  No solicitation document is available, and telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation will not be honored.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  All responses received within 15 days will be considered.  If no affirmative written response is received, the service contract will be awarded without further notice. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Albuquerque District (SPA) intends to award a contract for the to procure the ability to access and download data, which is gathered by the StormLinkTM rain gauges.  The data is accessed through a webpage hosted by Contrail  Web.  The rain gauges were placed as part of an early warning system for communities affected by the Las Conchas fire of 2011.  At the time, this was the largest wildfire in New Mexico, burning more than 156,000 acres of forest on the eastern slopes of the Jemez Mountains and the Pajarito Plateau.  The fire left large areas of the forest with major vegetation losses and soil conditions that may repel water.  Until the forest recovers, these conditions and the steep, rugged slopes in these watersheds combine to create a risk of landslides and flash flooding that in turn can create catastrophic risks to life and property in the communities and public facilities located downstream of the burned areas. <br>  <br> Our intent is to award a Sole Source contract to the OneRain Incorporated.  Per FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i), OneRain Incorporated has inherent knowledge of the webpage hosted by Contrail  Web.  OneRain Incorporated is the developer and sole distributor of the specific data that meets this unique requirement and the compatibility needs of data being used currently in the Jemez Mountains and the Pajarito Plateau areas. <br>  <br> A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is based upon the fact that OneRain Incorporated meets the requirement as dictated under FAR 6.302-1. <br>  <br> Detailed capabilities of interested vendors must be submitted to the following email addresses no later than 8:00 AM (Mountain Time) 02 March 2015, madeline.e.livermore@usace.army.mil. <br>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Omaha District, Contracting Division intends to negotiate and award on a sole source basis, a construction contract to Kiewit-Turner, a Joint Venture (KT) for the continued construction of the Department of Veteran Affairs' (VA) Eastern Colorado Health Care System (ECHCS) Replacement Medical Center in Aurora, Colorado.  The Medical Center has 11 buildings connected by a four-level concourse, consisting of a diagnosis and treatment facility; two (2) inpatient and three (3) outpatient facilities; a research building, a central energy plant; and three (3) separate garages.  The sole source award will permit KT to complete construction of the ECHCS that is currently partially physically complete.  The contract will establish the terms and conditions upon which the contractor will perform a wide variety of construction tasks necessary to complete the construction of the ECHCS Replacement Medical Center.  The magnitude of construction for a contract award resulting from this Notice of Intent is estimated at over $500,000,000 and is subject to availability of funds. <br>  <br> The proposed contract action is for construction services that the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Per FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), these services are deemed to be available only from the original source, KT, for the continued provision of highly specialized services since an award to any other source would likely result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, as well as unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. <br>  <br> THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS and no solicitation will be issued; however, any System for Award Management (SAM) registered firm that believes it can meet the requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer in the form of a capability statement.  Supporting evidence in sufficient detail that demonstrates the ability to comply with the requirement listed must be furnished to the point of contact listed below by 10:00 AM CST on Monday, March 2, 2015.

Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The USACE, Omaha District, will not reimburse for any costs connected with supplying sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement listed.  This acquisition falls under Classification Code Y, Construction of Structures and Facilities; and the North American Industrial Classification System code 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction with a size standard of $36,500,000. <br>

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided.

<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria.

By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC). If the Government's intent for payment is via the GPC IAW clauses 52.232-36 and 52.212-4, Addendum, paragraph (i) (3), the Offeror must certify that it:<br />( ) (i) will accept the GPC for payments under this contract.<br />( ) (ii) will not accept the GPC for payments under this contract.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p><strong>I. Description of Contractor Requirements</strong><br />The NCI and Clinical Pharmacology Program (CPP) seek to establish a contract that encompasses the preventative maintenance (2 visits per year), certified telephone support and on-site repairs (including all parts) for two AB SCIEX QTRAP5500 mass spectrometers within the Office of the Clinical Director, CCR, NCI, in Bethesda, MD. The instruments perform analysis and quantification of small molecules (primarily anti-cancer drugs) in biological matrices. They are used in support of pharmacokinetic studies required in many of the ongoing clinical trials being conducted within the CCR. The instruments are integral to the work of the Clinical Pharmacology Program and are utilized extensively to run CLIA-certified assays for numerous drugs. These CLIA-certified assays are used to generate data that is ultimately the basis for clinical dosing decisions. As such, a comprehensive preventative maintenance, performed by certified engineers, and repair contract is essential for continued operation.</p>
<p>1. SCOPE: Contractor shall provide all labor, material and equipment to provide maintenance for two government-owned AB SCIEX QTRAP5500 mass spectrometers (NIH DECALS: 01831924 and 01831926) within the Molecular Pharmacology Section, comprised of:</p>
<p>1. AB SCIEX TRAP5500 (named Q1) - SN: AU24721011<br />2. AB SCIEX TRAP5500 (named Q2) - SN: AU24061008</p>
<p>All maintenance service shall be performed in accordance with the manufacturer's standard commercial maintenance practices. <br /><br />2. PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE: Contractor shall perform TWO Preventive Maintenance Inspection (PMI) visits per annum during the contract period. Technically qualified, certified, and factory-trained personnel, who receive certification renewal biannually, shall perform Service. Service shall consist of an initial diagnostic test using Analyst Service Diagnostics&reg; assay, thorough cleaning, calibration, adjusting, inspection, part replacement and testing of all equipment in accordance with the manufacturer's latest established service procedures. This agreement includes all OEM parts and labor at no additional cost to the Government.</p>
<p>In order to properly maintain the QTRAP5500, several parts and function of the instrument must be checked, calibrated, routinely replaced, and then verify that all processes and capabilities of the instrument are working within factory specifications. The two AB Sciex QTRAP5500 mass spectrometers are in optimal performance thanks to the tests that have been performed semi-annually for the past 4 years. Contractor must conduct the following tests semi-annually:</p>
<p>Pre-Maintenance:<br />1. Utilize the Analyst Service Diagnostics&reg; test to identify potential areas of concern<br />2. Turbo and roughing pumps<br />3. Vacuum gauge and pressure checks<br />4. Front-end contamination checks<br />5. Tests for Q1 and Q3 in both Positive and Negative ion modes (10 Da/s)<br />6. MS/MS mode test<br />7. Enhanced resolution (ER) model test (1000 Da/s) in both Positive and Negative ion modes</p>
<p>Planned Maintenance<br />1. Roughing pump maintenance (change oil, replace oil filter, seals, etc)<br />2. Replace instrument air filters<br />3. Clean turbo pump air filter<br />4. Check the bench cooling fans<br />5. Clean the curtain plate, orifice plate, QJet ion guide and Q0<br />6. Perform maintenance on Turbo V ion source (TIS) <br />7. Temperature checks for both the TIS and APCI</p>
<p>Post-Maintenance<br />1. Vacuum pressure check<br />2. Check the RF tuning voltages<br />3. Check the detector voltages<br />4. Front-end contamination check<br />5. Run positive ion mode tests for Q1 and Q3 at 10, 200, 1000, and 10000 Da/s scan rates<br />6. MS/MS mode test<br />7. ER mode tests, both positive and negative, at 50, 250, 1000, 10000, and 20000 Da/s scan rates<br />8. Enhanced product ion mode tests<br />9. MS/MS/MS mode test (ion trap)<br />10. Clean up computer files<br />11. Back-up the Analyst&reg; software files<br />12. Defragment the hard drive</p>
<p>3. EMERGENCY SERVICE: The technical helpdesk shall be available Monday through Friday 9am-5pm (EST), standard working hours of NCI, Clinical Pharmacology Program (CPP). There shall be a trouble-shooting help line available. If any problem cannot be resolved, a certified engineer and/or OEM parts shall be sent on-site at no charge to the Government. Contractor must own a diagnostic software to remotely identify problems that need to be repaired in the equipment. Additionally, real-time monitoring from a remote site is critical to maintaining optimal performance during off-hours (nights/weekends) when instruments are operational. Malfunctions during these times will be remotely and automatically detected and diagnosed, and on-site service can be scheduled for the customer even when the customer is not present to discover said malfunctions.</p>
<p>4. REPLACEMENT PARTS: All replacement OEM parts for the instruments are available from AB SCIEX. The contractor shall furnish all required replacement parts at no additional cost to the Government. Parts shall be new or re-manufactured to original manufacturer equipment specifications.</p>

<p><br /><strong>BASIS FOR AWARD: </strong></p>
<p>Selection of an offeror for award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against four factors. The factors, in order of importance are: technical, personnel requirements, organizational experience, and price. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. However, cost/price may become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than cost/price. The process described in FAR 15.101-1 may be employed, which permits the Government to make tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors to consider award to other than the lowest price offer or other than the highest technically rated factor. The Government intends to make an award to the offeror whose proposals provide the best overall value to the Government.</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs set forth in the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed factors listed below.</p>
<p><strong>The Evaluation Process:</strong></p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this quotation to the responsible contractor whose quote conforming to the quotation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following evaluation factors shall be used to evaluate the prospective contractors and are listed in order of importance.</p>
<p>1. Technical Approach (60)<br />2. Personnel Requirements and Organizational Experience (40)<br />3. Price</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA: </strong></p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br /><br />The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-CSS-15-144 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). <br /><br /><strong>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br /></strong>The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 541990 with a Size Standard of 500 Employees.
<p><strong><br />SET-ASIDE STATUS<br /></strong>This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small businesses.</p>
<p><strong>ACQUISITION AUTHORITY <br /></strong>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, and IS expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. <br /><br />The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-78, dated December 26, 2014. The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through this date. <br /><strong><br />DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT </strong></p>
<p><strong>Background<br /></strong>A major research direction of the Drug Design and Synthesis Section (DDSS), in the Molecular Targets and Medications Discovery Branch (MTMDB) of the Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), is the elucidation of the structure and function of neurotransmitter systems in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) and the molecular mechanism of action of CNS active drugs. Organic/medicinal chemistry is the foundation of the multidisciplinary antagonists, imaging agents, affinity ligands, and other drugs for specific applications. New, highly selective ligands for drug receptors are synthesized, using all of the contemporary tools of medicinal chemistry. DDSS is involved with research on: (1) central opioid receptor subtypes and peripheral opioid receptors, (2) narcotic tolerance and dependence, (3) the synthesis of haptens for a heroin vaccine, and (4) the development of new ligands for positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of drug receptors in the CNS of living animals and conscious<br />humans.</p>
<p>Potent and selective ligands are prepared for specific opioid receptors. We have provided tools for PET imaging of opioid receptors, purified the delta opioid receptor to homogeneity seven years prior to cloning, introduced corticotropin releasing hormone antagonists for study of stress-induced relapse to drug abuse and developed the NIH Opiate Total Synthesis. The latter renders the natural opiate enantiomers available independent of the opium poppy and thus offers poppy eradication a strategy to combat heroin abuse. It also provides unnatural opiates as valuable research tools and as potential agents for the treatment of drug abuse via functional antagonism of Toll-like 4 receptors. DDSS, MTMDB, is unique in its ability to forge ahead on these difficult and extremely important areas of science. It is essential that the research findings of DDSS, MTMDB, be made available to the scientific community by publication in highly rated journals.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose<br /></strong>The purpose of this requirement is acquisition of contractor support services to ensure that scientific data obtained in the Section is published in refereed journals and interested DDSS postdoctoral scientists are acquainted about the publication process. Support is also required for consultation to assist the DDSS in ensuring that current and future research projects suitable for publication will be carried out. Support will be provided by the contractor to help postdoctoral fellows - the DDSS Visiting Fellows and IRTAs, mostly organic chemists (some of whom do not have English as their primary language), become more familiar with the writing of manuscripts in various scientific journals, and with the background of the research. The contractor will also aid with the presentation of posters and oral reports by postdoctoral fellows, and be available to provide support both onsite and/or through a home office via phone or email as approved by the Government.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Requirements<br /></span></strong>The Contractor shall perform the following tasks: <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1) Dissemination of DDS Work<br /></span></strong>The contractor will assist the Chief (DDSS, NIDA) to collect, review, and select DDSS research data to publish in first-rate, refereed scientific journals. The number of manuscripts is variable, and is dependent on the number and the output of the postdoctoral fellows. During the past 4 years, the Chief (DDSS, NIDA) has been a co-author on 94 publications. The contractor will also aid with the presentation of posters and oral reports by postdoctoral fellows, and will be available for consultation both onsite and/or through a home office via phone or email.<br /><br /><strong>A) Manuscript Preparation: <br /></strong>The contractor shall assist with writing manuscripts for publication and training interested postdoctoral fellows to write. This will include assistance with the introduction, results and discussion, and conclusion, compilation of references and acknowledgement sections of a manuscript, as well as gathering of materials (e.g. CCDC numbers when necessary for publication) for all DDSS manuscripts. The postdoctoral fellows in DDSS will provide written experimental work needed for the manuscript to the contractor. <br /><br />a. The Contractor will assist with the creation of manuscripts including both text and visual elements using Microsoft Word, ChemDraw, Endnote, etc. The work must be compatible with the Apple operating system for Mac computers.<br /><br />b. The Contractor will provide support to modify the written experimental work provided by DDSS postdoctoral fellows for compliance with journal requirements, will examine the experimental work to assure that it is complete and sufficient for publication, and will request additional information from scientists when the Contractor or Chief (DDSS, NIDA) deems it necessary.<br /><br />c. The Contractor will provide support to ensure that all manuscripts are written in accordance with the requirements of the journals in which they shall be published, and proof read all manuscripts for spelling, grammar, and nomenclature. The journals will be chosen by joint agreement of the Chief (DDSS, NIDA), the author (s), the DDSS postdoctoral fellows involved. The Contractor may provide recommendations as requested. Journals for potential publication may include, but are not limited to, the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Journal of Organic Chemistry, Chirality, Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry, Organic Letters, Science, Helvetica, Tetrahedron, Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry, Heterocycles, Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry, Synthesis, Journal of Labelled Compounds and Radiopharmaceuticals, Journal of Natural Products, Tetrahedron Letters.<br /><br /><strong>B) Manuscript Submission:<br /></strong>a. The Contractor will assist postdoctoral fellows in the preparation of finalized manuscripts for journal submission. Manuscript articles are generally submitted online and submission cover letters drafted for approval by the Chief (DDSS, NIDA). The Contractor will submit manuscripts to journals for the Chief (DDSS, NIDA), and will teach interested postdoctoral fellows how publication is accomplished. <br /><br />b. The Contractor shall make as many unbound copies of the printed manuscript as needed (at this time one copy is needed), prior to submission to the journal and send the copy through the proper channels to the Chief of the Branch, for the Office of the Intramural Scientific Director, for approval. The Contractor shall also provide a copy of each submitted manuscript to each author, either by email or in printed form, as desired by the authors. <br /><br />c. The Contractor will provide support to ensure that all paperwork necessary to establish the manuscript as work of the US Government is completed. Generally this includes the NIH Publishing Agreement which will be filled out and provided to the Chief (DDSS, NIDA) or to the Chief of the Branch for signature, and sent by the Contractor to the journal, generally via an online site, or by whatever other means is deemed necessary. <br /><br /><strong>C) Manuscript Revision:<br /></strong>a. Following journal review, the Contractor will assist postdoctoral fellows in the manuscript revision process, and provide answers, if needed, to any comments or questions from journal reviewers and via editorial review. The Contractor may contact the manuscript author(s) as necessary for assistance, and the Contractor will compile the information required for any needed revision. <br /><br />b. The Contractor will resubmit the revised manuscript, generally using the online site of the journal. Upon resubmission, the Contractor shall assist Government employees to write and include a letter for the Chief (DDSS, NIDA) to the journal editor explaining all revisions made to the manuscript. This entire process will also be used as a teaching tool for interested DDSS postdoctoral fellows who wish to become involved in the process. <br /><br /><strong>D) Manuscript Distribution <br /></strong>Following manuscript acceptance and publication, the Contractor will ensure that the manuscript is forwarded to PubMed Central for publication in PubMed. The Contractor will be responsible for any manuscript changes needed for PubMed publication and will contact the authors as necessary for this purpose. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) RD utilizes lender-placed insurance to protect the Government's loan portfolio assets. The USDA RD intends to continue lender-placed insurance through contractor provided services nationwide including U.S. Territories which include Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands.The Government (USDA, Rural Development) provides loans to low and moderate income applicants located in rural geographic areas to assist them in obtaining single/guaranteed/multi-family housing through various programs. As of September 30, 2013, the Government had approximately 319,000 Direct Single Family Housing loans that represent just over 286,000 borrowers. Section 502 Direct loans are generally secured by first mortgages on modest dwellings located on non-farm tracts of one acre or less. The Single Family Housing Direct loans are located in each of the 50 states and U.S. territories that include Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. Approximately 8,000 new single family loans are originated per year. Rural Development (RD) currently processes all loan originations through state offices and approximately 700 field offices. The Centralized Servicing Center (CSC), located in St. Louis, Missouri provides support to the field offices for loan originations and is responsible for most servicing functions. Currently the Single Family Direct loan program is approximately ninety-two (92) percent escrow and the Hazard and Flood Compliance Section tracks one hundred (100) percent of the customers that are required to maintain a homeowner's, windstorm or flood insurance policy. (If re-categorization of types of coverage is brought on due to insurance company realignment of lines of business, our needs shall change in accordance with the change). <br />As of September, 1, 2013, RD had 14,971 Multi-Family Housing (MFH) projects with total units encompassing approximately 436,000 and total loans of 24,934. Currently these loans are not escrowed. RD Multi-Family Housing programs provide a number of finance options to developers of low-income community housing. <br />

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.(c) Special rules. <BR> <BR>The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC).

Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing.

Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as "Not Separately Priced" by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as "No Charge" by entering "NC" in the unit price. <br />c.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>

<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

<p>(a) Definition. "Export-controlled items," as used in this clause, means items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR Parts 730-774) or the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR Parts 120-130). The term includes:</p>
<p>(1) "Defense items," defined in the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778(j)(4)(A), as defense articles, defense services, and related technical data, and further defined in the ITAR, 22 CFR Part 120.</p>
<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>
<p>(2) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.);</p>

<p>(6) Executive Order 13222, as extended.</p>
<p>(e) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (e), in all subcontracts.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>
<p>(3) Advice as to whether the inability to perform may adversely affect national security, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

Under the RFSE production effort, the contractor will:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A - produce and deliver up to seven RFSE suites, up to four sets of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; support equipment, and initial spares in accordance with the applicable <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; standards and government-provided drawings;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B - provide interim contractor support for all RFSE units;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C - train users on how to operate, test, maintain, troubleshoot<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;problems,&nbsp;and do field-level repairs the RFSE.<br />Contractors must have the ability to perform design requalification and recertification if circumstances necessitate a change in the nuclear-certified design of the RFSE-such a change would require nuclear surety and nuclear safety experience. Due to the nuclear-certified design, contractors must have a well-defined and detailed manufacturing plan (including environmental controls), stringent configuration control, and a high degree of quality assurance.</p>
<p>Delivery of the first RFSE unit will be made no later than 20 months after contract award, and all RFSE units and support equipment must be delivered no later than 44 months after contract award.</p>
<p>The solicitation will result in issuance of a Definitive Contract with multiple options. Draft parts of the solicitation critical to an offeror's understanding of the requirement have been released on FBO under the number FA8214-14-R-9000. This included Section L, Section M, and the model contract (with Contract Line Item Numbering Structure). Interested parties who seek more information on this acquisition (including but not limited to quantity, unit of issue, and destination information) are advised to review that draft release. The draft will be updated upon solicitation release, and offerors are required to review the solicitation for any updates.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be a full and open competition (not a small business set aside), using the lowest price, technically acceptable source selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Source Selection and the Department of Defense (DoD) Source Selection Procedures (effective 1 July 2011) as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS), and the Air Force Source Selection Mandatory Procedures (MP5315.3). A formal Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 15 December 2014 on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO).</p>
<p>The solicitation (except the technical data package-see below) will be released on FBO. Paper copies of the solicitation (except technical orders-see below) will not be mailed. Interested offerors are responsible for checking FBO to obtain the solicitation and any amendments or other information pertaining to the solicitation and are encouraged to register for notification through FBO.</p>
<p>While the solicitation will be placed on FBO, the technical data package (TDP) will not. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application, and the TDP contains <strong>export controlled data</strong>. As such, the only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose. Those that are certified and registered will have a DD Form 2345 certified by the Joint Certification Program. For those contractors that do not have a certified DD Form 2345, but would like to participate in this acquisition, the form, including instructions for completing the form, is available at</p>
<p>http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/forminfo/forminfopage2220.html.</p>
<p>Interested parties are advised that approval of a DD2345 may take time, so completion and submission of that form now rather than upon or after release of the solicitation is highly recommended.</p>
<p>To obtain a copy of the TDP, offerors must request the TDP from the contracting officer listed in the below point of contact section. The request must include a copy of the offeror's current, approved DD Form 2345. Once an offeror's DD Form 2345 is verified, access to the drawings, specifications, and other program documents through the software program, TopVue, will be provided to the data custodian identified in block 3 of the DD Form 2345. After approval of the controlling office, technical orders will be provided to the data custodian by mail.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Foreign participation at the prime contractor level is not permitted</span>. All offerors must be actively registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) (https://www.sam.gov) to be eligible for award. In addition, offerors must ensure their Annual Representations and Certifications are updated and current.</p>

<DESC><p>The objective is to conduct applied R&amp;D to develop and demonstrate leap-ahead agile RF front-end systems with multi-function transmit / receive technology by employing reconfigurable RF &amp; mixed-signal components which enable integrated Radar, Communications, &amp; EW suites within a single platform. Salient features of the REMAR module are (1) configurable system architecture, (2) adaptable frequency plan, (3) tunable instantaneous bandwidth, (4) scalable DC &amp; RF power, and (5) agile waveform. Critical performance goals for the system include ultra wide bandwidth, high dynamic range, low phase noise, environmental compensation, on-chip calibration to enable autonomous adaptation, &amp; precise bias control. Ultimately, the REMAR technology will result in a highly flexible system with dramatic cost, size, weight, and power (CSWAP) reduction for future advanced sensor technology critical to the warfighter.</p>
<p>Contractor shall systematically assess and develop leap-ahead reconfigurable RF/mixed-signal components with embedded digital control to enable adaptable On-The-Fly (OTF) electronics capable of performing multiple sensor functions simultaneously. System capability demonstrations and performance impact analysis are required by contractor at the end of the baseline period of performance with updated demonstration/analysis at the end of the option period. Contractor shall seek to identify and demonstrate advanced technologies and novel techniques to increase system flexibility without compromising performance. Advanced techniques such as (1) OTF adaptable system configuration (polarization, frequency, bandwidth, power, &amp; waveform); (2) cognitive (very low latency reactionary and anticipatory) functionality; (3) coordinated &amp; distributed network enabled capability; (4) broadband &amp; multi spectral performance; &amp; (5) advanced protection/survivability techniques are desirable attributes for REMAR.</p>

<DESC>The Government anticipates entering into a Small Business Set-Aside contract, consisting of one (1) twelve (12) month base period and two (2) twelve (12) month option periods, totaling an estimated $8.3 Million, for non-personnel Services in support of the Software Engineering Center (SEC) Tactical Logistics Directorate (TLD) Army Food Management Information System (AFMIS). The resulting contract will be Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Term for labor services and Cost (no fee) for travel and other direct costs (ODCs).  <br>    <br>  AFMIS is the management information system that supports the Army food program. CECOM SEC-EISD Legacy Logistics Division, Food Systems Branch has had the AFMIS sustainment mission since AFMIS was fielded in 1989.  AFMIS is operational at Army installations, U.S. Army Reserve centers, and Army National Guard armories worldwide. AFMIS is currently operational at 65 Active Army installations in troop issue subsistence activities, food program management offices, and dining facilities.  Each installation has one subsistence supply activity and one food program management office.  AFMIS is also operational in about 450 Active Army dining facilities, and at about 3,500 Army Reserve and 2,500 National Guard units.  AFMIS provides automation support of menu planning, meal production, ordering and receipting food, financial accounting, headcount and capital asset reporting, inventory control, contract quality assurance, and personnel accountability at Army dining facilities, field kitchens, and subsistence supply activities. AFMIS interfaces with the Subsistence Total Order and Receipt System and the Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) to provide financial accountability of Army food inventories. AFMIS includes an automated headcount service which allows for diner entitlement verification and payroll deduction for meals via the common access ID card. AFMIS includes a decision support system (DSS) available to food program managers and logisticians at all levels of Command.  <br>    <br>  AFMIS is a centralized Web-based system with separate subsystems concurrently running and interfaced together on the same platform but with separate databases. AFMIS consists of Dining Facility Operations (DFO), Troop Issue Subsistence Activity (TISA), Food Program Management (FPM), and Automated Head Count (AHC) subsystems.  <br>    <br>  Support for AFMIS includes software engineering, system administration, testing support, configuration management, user support, and program/project management.  <br>    <br>  Government facilities will be provided for this effort at Ft.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY for an airbag system that is capable of meeting the basic requirements described below.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB).  It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources for planning purposes only.  Responses to this notice are not considered as offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information presented or the use of any such information.     <br>      <br> DESCRIPTION:   <br>      <br> The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development, and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA is seeking a domestic source for energy dissipating airbags, to be used with a specific cargo aerial delivery platform, for test and evaluation.    <br>      <br> The U.S. Army has recently proven the concept of modifying the United Kingdom's Medium Stressed Platform (MSP) to function with U.S. C-130J aircraft.  The platform uses airbags integrated into the structure to dissipate impact energy upon touchdown in lieu of energy dissipating material (EDM, aka honeycomb) currently used by the U.S.  The concept of using airbags instead of honeycomb is believed to benefit the U.S. Army by reducing impact forces to cargo, thus improving cargo survivability.   <br>      <br> REQUIREMENTS:   <br>      <br> The desired airbag design should consist of a cylinder made of impermeable fabric, sandwiched between two mattress boards, with a one-way valve on the bottom and an orifice on the top.  See the attached file 'Airbag Assembly.pdf'  for a picture representing the desired airbag configuration.  The impermeable fabric cylinder shall be collapsible for storage and expandable during deployment.  The cylinder will most likely be reinforced with wire or flexible rod to improve the hoop strength.  The mattress boards shall be made from 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch plywood or similar and are attached to the cylinder with ties or other type of replaceable fasteners.  The bottom board shall be furnished with a one-way valve through which the airbag is inflated by ram air during descent, much the same way a parachute is inflated.  The top board shall be furnished with a sacrificial patch that covers the orifice.  Upon platform touchdown, the airbag is compressed, increasing the air pressure, causing the sacrificial patch to burst.  During compression the orifice controls the air flow exiting the cylinder, slowing down the load to the ground.     <br>      <br> The platform to which the airbags will interface is the United Kingdom's (UK) Medium Stressed Platform (MSP).  See the attached file 'MSP Assembly.pdf' for an illustration of the platform. The MSP is constructed of three longitudinal channels (one channel on each side and one center channel) and twenty-three (23) transverse channels.  The top of the transverse channels provide the surface to which the cargo load is secured.  The airbags are located beneath the transverse channels, between the longitudinal channels.  The top mattress boards of the airbags run along the ledges of the longitudinal channels and are tied in place.  The bottom mattress boards are held in place by the platform's skid doors.  Between the two side channels and the center channel are two slots that accept the airbag assemblies.

Original solicitation number: SPM4A2-10-R-0001 <br />This agency proposes to add multiple NSNs from multiple FSCs to an existing long-term strategic/sole source contract. A total of 15 NSNs are currently targeted for this contract effort. These items have been identified as sole source. However, some items may have history showing awards to other than the OEM.
<p>The proposed action is intended to be awarded on a sole source basis to General Electric at CAGEs 07482 &amp; 99207. The proposed items are intended for addition to existing sole source contract SPE4AX12D9422 under award to General Electric, CAGEs: 07482 &amp; 99207 (IAW FAR 6.302-1). This is a Requirements type Contract with six point sixty-seven (6.67) years remaining. The contract requires supply of parts as well as other functions including but not limited to inventory management, forecasting, distribution, storage, reliability improvements, engineering maintenance, and design (control) affecting these parts. Subcontracting opportunities do exist for this effort.</p>
<p>Letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified OEM. This is proposed to be a FAR 15 effort.</p>
<p>A letter RFP will be issued to satisfy this action. The attached list of NSNs is the items for this current action. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately.</p>
<p>Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by March 16, 2015 and should identify items of interest and include evidence of ability to supply the items for the contract period as identified. A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and the SBA PCR Anne Mastrincola (anne.mastrincola@dla.mil).</p>
<p>Surplus dealers, small business dealers and distributors (having on-hand existing stock of surplus or newly manufactured material) are invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. In addition, respondents should identify quantity available and price. The government may procure material or alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best interest of the Government.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>THIS&nbsp;PROJECT&nbsp;IS&nbsp;ADVERTISED&nbsp;ON&nbsp;A&nbsp;FULL&nbsp;AND OPEN BASIS.<br />&nbsp;<br /></strong>Project Details: This project is located in Monterey County, California within Fort Ord National Monument adjacent to State Route 68 (Monterey-Salinas Highway) approximately 6 miles southwest of Salinas. This project consists of the replacement of the existing 125 foot long Guidotti Bridge over El Toro Creek.</p>
<p>The existing Guidotti Bridge is an approximately 125 foot long, single lane, 3 span filled concrete spandrel arch structure. The middle arch was constructed in 1908 and two exterior spans constructed in 1911. The bridge site is on Guidotti Road trail, a single lane gravel road, located approximately &frac14; mile from Badger Hill Trail head parking lot adjacent to State Route 68.</p>
<p>Guidotti Road and other roads and trails within Fort Ord National Monument experience high visitor use including pedestrians, bicyclists, and equestrians. The bridge will be closed to all traffic during construction but adjacent trail access will need to be maintained for visitors. Portions of the existing concrete structure, containing the original stamped bridge dates, are required to be sawcut and salvaged for incorporation into an interpretative display.</p>
<p>The proposed single-span bridge superstructure will consist of 4 adjacent prestressed concrete box beams with thin bonded epoxy overlay. The bridge will be founded on eight (8) driven steel H-piles (HP 14x89) extended approximately 50-feet deep into silty sand and sandy silt subsurface materials. A wave-equation analysis completed by an experienced professional engineer will be required prior to approval of pile-driving equipment. During pile driving operations great attention to detail will be required to ensure that the alignment is within &frac14; inch per foot and the piles are driven to within 3 inches of the required cutoff location.</p>
<p>This project will require approximately 4,100 LB of reinforcing steel (epoxy coated), 25 CUYD of structural concrete, 380 LNFT of driven steel H-piles, 392 LNFT of precast, prestressed concrete box beam, 200 LNFT of 54 inch high, combination steel and concrete bridge railing, 160 SQYD of thin bonded epoxy overlay, 225 CUYD of earthwork, and 300 CUYD of riprap.</p>
<p>This project is located within a sensitive location on BLM lands with high public visitation. All construction debris will need to be contained and kept out of the active channel at the bridge site and dewatering will be required for all work within the active channel. Great attention to detail will be required in achieving customer satisfaction in areas of bridge construction, timely completion of work, minimization of impacts to natural resources, and visitor relations.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this project will be advertised in February 2015 with construction occurring from April through August, 2015. THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID. PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS ARE NOT YET AVAILABLE.&nbsp; The anticipated contract value is between $.5 million and $1 million.</p>

<p>1.0 BACKGROUND<br />The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Program, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, currently has Call Management, Data-Intake, Fulfillment, Distribution, Storage and Printing-coordination (CDFDSP) operations.</p>
<p>The Call Management operations team is responsible for handling calls from retail grocery store owners that are either looking for guidance on how to apply to USDA for a license for their store to accept SNAP benefits, or are currently authorized and are calling with basic questions on how the program operates. The call management operations team provides assistance to help guide store owners through the online store application process or take orders for paper application requests from store owners interested in applying to accept SNAP benefits at their store and answers basic questions following a script covering SNAP retailer program information available on the FNS public web at http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap. FNS receives close to 40,000 applications each year and encourages stores to apply online. In fiscal year 2013, roughly 90% of our applicants applied electronically and the remaining 10% via a paper application.</p>
<p>The call management operations team re-directs business owners with detailed or policy questions (anything beyond what is available on FNS's public web) to a FNS Office, based on the location of the store, in order for a FNS employee to address their questions. The call management operations team deal primarily with small business owners and focuses heavily on data-intake, fulfillment, distribution and storage operations, in addition to standard customer service expectations. These services also entail coordination of the FNS - SNAP - Retailer Printing processes. The call management operations team use a web based database, called the Store Tracking and Redemption System (STARS) to enter data from SNAP store applications (Data-Intake) as well as data regarding receipt of standard documentation. STARS generates daily batch files for approved stores that require a printed authorization kit and SNAP generated letters to be mailed to store owners in bulk.</p>
<p>FNS SNAP seeks support services to handle the CDFDSP operations. The objective is to provide superior customer service, achieve cost savings, leverage the best-suited call management software, reduce overhead cost, and maintain one centralized point of contact for call tracking, data-intake, fulfillment, distribution, storage and printing-coordination. FNS SNAP Program plans to utilize a performance-based contract structure for the SNAP CDFDSP project.</p>
<p>2.0 CURRENT ENVIRONMENT<br />Retailers may not legally accept SNAP benefits without FNS authorization. Retailers who apply for authorization do so by applying online at http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/retailers/application-process.htm or by calling to request a paper application.</p>
<p>As a support service to active and potential retailers in SNAP, call management operations teams are currently located in Washington, DC.

<DESC><strong>RECOVERY - THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION (SSA) FUNDED THIS ACTION IN WHOLE VIA THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (PUB. L. 111-5) (RECOVERY ACT). THE AGENCY PROVIDES THIS NOTICE "FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY."</strong>
<p>On February 13, 2015, SSA awarded Task Order #0023 to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation. This opportunity was available only to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, under a pre-existing agency-wide Indefinite-delivery, Indefinite-quantity Contract Number SS00-10-60082. The task order included services related to Software Engineering Management, under technical area (8) of the contract.</p>
<p>Task Order 0023 was issued on a time-and-materials basis, as allowable under the contract, and per Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 12.207(c)(2). Due to the nature of SSA's IT systems environment, which includes rapidly changing needs and technologies, the agency determined that a firm fixed-price structure was not suitable for this requirement. This announcement meets the requirements of FAR 5.705.</p>
<p><strong>This notice is for "Informational purposes only."</strong></p>

<p>1. Identification of the agency and contracting activity. <br />a. Federal agency and contracting activity. HHS/ NIH/National Cancer Institute (NCI) <br />b. Sponsoring organization. Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) /Office of the Director</p>
<p>c. Project Officer information.</p>
<p>1. Project Officer name. <br />2. Mailing address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved. <br /><br />a. Acquisition purpose and objectives. This requirement is to enter into a three-month "bridge" delivery order to allow time to recompete, OCPL's transition communication support services, and/or transition these services to a new awardee, if necessary. The bridge will allow for the continuation of the needed communication support services. A competitive GSA acquisition will be issued via GSA Federal Supply Schedule.</p>
<p>b. Project background.

<p>Nature of the acquisition and proposed contractor(s) unique qualifications. The current contractor, Ogilvy Public Relations, have been providing communications support services to the NCI research and scientific community for the past five years, and is uniquely qualified to continue to provide these services on an interim basis without any need to train and ramp up. If competed, and a new contractor would receive the award it would not be cost effective due to startup cost and time to get the new contractor acclimated. In addition, communicating important science information would be delayed. It is NCI OA's intent to conduct a full and open competition during the life of the interim delivery order.</p>
<p>5. Determination by the ordering activity Contracting Officer that the order represents the best value consistent with FAR 8.404(d).

<p>7. Any other facts supporting the justification. No other facts.<br /><br />8. Statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made.</p>
<p>a. Removal of barriers to competition. A full and open competition GSA Schedule 541 will be solicited for the needed communication support service. The interim delivery order is intended to provide time to allow for the competition while providing continuity of the needed communication services to the institute.</p>
<p>b. Listing of sources, if any, that expressed an interest, in writing, in the acquisition. No other sources have expressed an interest, in writing, in the proposed acquisition.</p>
