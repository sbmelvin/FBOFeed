<DESC>NOAA's Acquisitions &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Silicon Quest International, Reno, NV for the purchase of <br />silicon wafers.
<p>The sole source determination is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) requirement for the highest quality wafers, which market research indicates that the only known vendor to meet the government's requirement is Silicon Quest International. Specifically no other vendor can provide three inch, 100 oriented, intrinsic (undoped) "float-zone" Si wafers with ultra-high resistivity. Because the government has developed a process around the nitridization of the 100-face, it is critical to obtain this same orientation and can only be provided from Silicon Quest International. Delivery 12 weeks.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.
