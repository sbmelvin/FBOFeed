<DESC><p>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW), Command and Control System - Consolidated (CCS-C) Program Office, intends to modify the existing CCS-C contract, F04701-01-C-0012, for the purpose of developing space vehicle specific software, command procedures, and databases that will provide Command and Control (C2) capabilities for the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) Block II Satellites 4-6, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(a)(2). The period of performance for this effort is from contract award through 30 June 2013. The modification for this additional effort will be issued to the incumbent contractor, Integral Systems Inc. (ISI), 6721 Columbia Gateway Drive, Columbia, MD 21046.
<p>The CCS-C Block I contract supports Launch &amp; Early Orbit (L&amp;EO) operations, on-orbit operations, anomaly resolution, and disposal operations. CCS-C supports these activities by providing telemetry processing, command processing, orbit data processing, ground system resource management, satellite and ground system simulation, mission planning and scheduling, support planning and execution, analysis tools, and system training. The CCS-C contract provides C2 capability for the full family of MILSATCOM satellite programs, with the capability to support other satellite programs. ISI's proprietary EPOCH Integrated Product Suite (IPS) is currently designed and operational to support four MILSATCOM satellite constellations: Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS); Milstar; Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) Block I; and Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF).</p>
<p>The addition of WGS Block II Satellites 4-6 to the CCS-C Block I contract will allow the incumbent contractor to develop the C2 capability for the WGS Block II Satellites 4-6 in accordance with the same "technical" instructions as on the current CCS-C contract. The WGS Block II schedule for Satellites 4-6 requires that CCS-C be ready to support three satellite factory compatibility tests in Calendar Year 2010, with the first test scheduled for January 2010.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Sources Sought Synopsis was published for this effort in order to explore the feasibility of competition. The Statements of Capability submitted confirmed that only the incumbent contractor, ISI, currently possesses the requisite experience, expertise, and data to support the critical program schedule and avoid unacceptable delays.</p>
<p>The information contained herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. This notice is for information purposes only and the Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of information in response to this or previous notices.</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a contract to the University of Florida, PO Box 110370, Gainesville, Florida 32611 in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1. The purpose of this project is to determine the normal patterns of DNA methylation and levels of uracil mis-incorporation and how these patterns change in response to folic acid supplementation and individual genotypes. The requirement is to utilize global methylation assay - liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to determine the ratio of methylcytosine to cytosine. This effort requires the Contractor to have the capability to perform this technique to yield sensitive and reproducible results with inter and intra assay variation less than 5%. The reason justifying the lack of competition is that University of Florida is the only one source available that has the capability to perform this technique to yield sensitive and reproducible results with inter and intra assay variation less than 5%.The period of performance is anticipated to be a twelve month base year and one option year.</p>
<p>p&gt;This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes/proposals, however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement which, if received by the response date, shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

The Western Montana Acquisition Zone antcipates a Request for Quote for forest wide trail maintenance for the USDA Forest Service, Bitterroot National Forest.  
The Contractor shall provide all expertise, labor, supervision, services, equipment, mobilization, tools, supplies (i.e., water, etc.), permits, licenses, transportation, and incidentals necessary to perform trail maintenance on OHV and single track trails (wilderness and non-wilderness).
The work involves logging out the trail clearing limits of downed or leaning trees; removing loose rocks and woody debris that have entered the trail tread; and cleaning all existing drainage facilities (to original design) since the last maintenance period . No brushing or blasting is required.  OHV trail drainage structures will require considerably more work than single track structures. Government estimates of time are 15-30 minutes per OHV drainage structure. There are approximately 50 structures per mile. These estimates are made using basic hand tools. Tread widths may vary from 50” maximum width on TR# 39 & 313 – Chain of Lakes & Bitterroot-Rock Divide, to 64” maximum width on TR# 182, 185 & 248 – Taylor Creek, Jew Mtn & Drop Creek. 
Past trailway maintenance practice has used chainsaws (on trails NOT in wilderness), crosscut saws (on trails in wilderness) and various hand tools to effectively perform this type of work.
The terrain is characterized by very steep and deeply dissected topography.  Conditions on the trails will vary widely in regard to amount of blowdown, rocks, and grade. Weather conditions in this area are unpredictable and may include thunder, lightning storms, and wind.  These conditions are already accommodated in the delivery schedule.

This solicitation will be solicited under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). No site visit is scheduled for this project.  For further information, please contact Nick Hazelbaker at the West Fork Ranger Station at 406-821-3269.  The solicitation will be issued approximately April 23, 2009.  Estimated start date is June 15, 2009.

Proposed Issue Date:  July 6, 2009 (approximate)
Title of Project:  Replace Old Courthouse Roof, PMIS:  JEFF-007895
Description:  Approximately 20,000 SF of roof on the historic Old Courthouse, located in downtown St. Louis, MO, needs replacement.  Constructed in the mid-nineteenth century, the courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  It is a prominent architectural landmark with high public visibility, adjacent to the Gateway Arch.  The existing roof installed in 1941 is deteriorated.  The roof consists of several architectural features, including prominent parapets, a dome, a low-slope surface, and roof penetrations for hatches, mechanical equipment, and skylights.  Current roofing systems involve standing seam metal, curb and cap flashing and integral gutters, interior roof drains, mechanical penetrations and equipment curbs/mounts, etc.  New work consists of maintenance of stone assemblies (parapet cleaning and repointing), repair of original concrete roof deck and selective replacement with steel deck, installation of metal fabrications (both integral to and accessory to the structure), and installation of sheet metal roofing and flashing, roof accessories, water barriers, and sealants.  Limited finish painting is included.  Structural work is located in the attic, located between the roof deck and top floor ceiling.  Aside from the drum of the dome, no dome reroofing is included.  Hazmat issues involve lead-paint abatement and removal of underlayment containing asbestos.  Demolition and disposal of existing roof surfaces, deteriorated structural fabric (concrete and steel) and waterproofing layers is required.  The site is urban.  The building will remain open during construction.  Construction is anticipated through a full winter season.
Type of Procurement:  A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price.
Estimated price range:  $3.5M to $4.5M.
Time for completion:  250 calendar days. 
Proposal receipt date is approximate; actual date will be established at the time proposal documents are available.
This action is set-aside for SERVICE-DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS (SDVOSB) sources.  All responsible SDVOSB sources may submit an offer that will be considered.
It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors, (large or small) are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Central Contractor Registration's (CCR) Dynamic Small Business Search for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories. 
Small Disadvantaged Business and HUBZone firms must be certified in accordance with solicitation clauses 52.219-8 -- Utilization of Small Business Concerns and 52.219-9 -- Small Business Subcontracting Plan (status of firms can be found on CCR's Dynamic Small Business Search).

They are deteriorating and require replacement. The average life span of a liner is approximately 20 years and by 2004 they will reach that life span. Replacement of approximately 740 cubic yards of sand and rock in the sand filter, which filters the treatment plant effluent before it goes through the chlorine chamber, will also ensure compliance with the plant's NPDES permit.

<DESC><p>A primary objective of the Navy's space research and development program is to preserve and enhance a strong space technology base and provide expert capabilities in the development and acquisition of space systems. To that end, NRL conducts a wide range of space technology studies, as well as space research and development projects. The scope of these research efforts and hence, this forthcoming solicitation, is quite broad and entails multi-disciplinary approaches to discovering and applying new knowledge and technologies to designing, building, and operating of space and other technology systems. This includes the processing and/or packaging of data from these research efforts, performance of scientific or technical analysis, and delivery/presentation of reports and other findings to the sponsor or designated customers. The major thrust of this effort is to aid NRL in the research and prototype development of spacecraft and space/airborne systems. This includes the analysis, design, development, test, operation demonstration, and transition of these systems and subsystems. A complete Statement of Work (SOW) will be available as part of the solicitation. It is anticipated that an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be made as a result of the solicitation. NRL uses Electronic Commerce (EC) to issue Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided. The actual closing date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation when issued.
<p>All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm. The Government does not intend to use FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>Requirement</p>
<p>The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Portland, Oregon, that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 5,485 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 4,897 contiguous ANSI/BOMA office area square feet (ABOAF). The lease term requirement is for 20 years, 10 years firm. The space must be available for occupancy by September 1, 2009. The delineated area is as follows:</p>
<p>North: NW Front Avenue<br />South: West Burnside Street<br />East: NW Front Avenue<br />West: Highway 405</p>
<p>Other applicable requirements include:</p>
<p>&bull; 18 onsite parking spaces, 9 must be adjacent to office space<br />&bull; Lab intensive build-out<br />&bull; Seismic certification<br />&bull; ADA compliance</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

Indicate whether or not quoted rental rate includes an amount for tenant improvement and state the amount, if any;<br />- Date of space availability;<br />- Method of rentable space measurement;<br />- Building ownership information;<br />- Amount of parking available on site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rates include the cost of the required Government parking, if any;<br />- Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building; and<br />- List of building services provided.</p>

<SUBJECT>RECOVERY - Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing Replacement Project 
<SOLNBR>GS-05P-09-GB-C-0027
<CONTACT>Daniel J Schlacks, Contract Specialist, Phone 312-353-6569, Fax 312-353-1491, Email daniel.schlacks@gsa.gov - Sherri Turner, Contracting Officer, Phone 312.886.7879, Email Sherri.Turner@gsa.gov
<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity to provide Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) service for the Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing Replacement project at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Ft. Snelling, Minnesota. This is an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 Project. The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and the option for Construction Phase Services. For this contract, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price (see FAR 15.101-1 Trade Offs). The CMc will be competitively chosen using Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures. The Government reserves the right to make award on initial offers, but discussions may be held if appropriate. The estimated total construction cost for the project falls within the range of $80,000,000 to $100,000,000.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Project Summary: The Whipple Building occupies an 11 acre site located in Fort Snelling, southeast of downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota. The building has eleven stories representing a useable space of approximately 630,000 gross square feet. The facility has a basement, ground level and first through sixth floors. The basement, ground and first floors have a larger floor plate than the upper floors. The site provides for approximately 1,100 exterior surface parking spaces. The building houses approximately 1,100 employees. Key issues for the Whipple Building are primarily associated with the mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems. With some exceptions, the main components of these systems are original to the date of construction and have met or exceeded their normal life expectancy. While the central boiler and chiller plants were recently upgraded, and HVAC improvements were also made to the third floor and a portion of the ground, first and second floors, the parameters under which those systems were designed have changed and simply replacing damaged or worn out parts with new similar parts is no longer sufficient or appropriate. Asbestos Containing Materials (ACM's) are prevalent throughout the building, particularly in the spaces above the ceilings. Major elements of this project involve, but are not limited to: completely and thoroughly abate the spray-applied fire proofing, piping insulation, vinyl asbestos floor tile and mastic, and other hazardous materials throughout the building; replace air handlers and fan coil units; replace boilers and chillers; replace the building ductwork and piping systems; replace building hydronic piping systems; replace building domestic water piping, main and local distribution including all restrooms; new HVAC control systems; renovate the non-renovated restrooms; replace fire doors; upgrade the fire pump; add sprinkler heads to provide full coverage; incorporate the new fire alarm system and fire protection strobes/alarm devices into the renovation;<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> </em>replace 208/120 volt panel boards and associated transformers, and electrical distribution; improve the capacity of the standby generator; a second electrical feeder into the building; new lighting systems and controls; telephone and data distribution and<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> </em>renovate the lobby and entry to follow suggestions of the First Impressions design study.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor: A CMc contractor is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner or client (in this case the GSA) to provide services such as design review, cost estimating, sustainability review, scheduling and general construction services. The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs). In contrast to a CM that is not also a constructor; the CMc is at risk and is involved with project development and administration of the construction. The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the design and construction phases, working with the A/E and the Government to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget. The CMc contractor will perform services including, but not limited to: evaluating design concepts, monitoring A-E progress, coordinating design reviews, reviewing designs, reviewing and preparing cost estimates, controlling schedules, keeping records, reporting on design and construction progress, conducting Value Engineering (VE) exercises, conducting constructability reviews, constructing the facility at or below the defined budget or Estimated Construction Cost at Award (ECCA), administering the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordinating construction meetings, CPM scheduling, monitoring construction costs and performing administrative and other services as defined in the scope of work to provide for a completely functional facility.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">There are two components of work to be performed under this Contract: Design Stage Services and Construction Stage Work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Construction Stage Work is an option.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Contractor is required to complete the Pre-design and Design Stage Services for the firm-fixed-price set forth in the Contract Price Schedule, such services to be directed toward completion of the design and establishment of an Estimated Cost of Work (ECW) agreed upon by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer based upon a target established at award and a Construction Contingency Allowance (CCA). The CCA shall be a percentage (as specified elsewhere in the Contract) of the ECW established in connection with the Design Phase Services. If the sum of the ECW, CCA and Fee is greater than the Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP), the Fee shall be adjusted to reduce that sum to the GMP. If the sum of the ECW, CCA and Fee is less than the GMP, the GMP shall be adjusted to that sum. If the Government exercises the option for the Construction Phase Work, the contractor shall complete the Construction Phase Work. In consideration for the completion of the Construction Phase Work, the Contractor shall be entitled to the Cost of Performance not to exceed the GMP. If the Cost of Performance is less than the GMP, the Contractor additionally shall be entitled to the specified percentage, if any, of the difference between the Cost of Performance and the GMP, as shared savings. If the Cost of Performance is equal or greater than the GMP, the Contractor shall not be entitled to additional compensation exceeding the GMP.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">Small Business Participation: In accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, this procurement is unrestricted and is therefore open to both large and small business concerns. Although this procurement is open to large business, small businesses are encouraged to participate. In accordance with Public Law 95-507, the offeror will be required to provide the maximum practicable opportunities for small, small veteran owned, small service disabled veteran owned, small HUBZone, small disadvantaged, and small women owned businesses through subcontracting opportunities.

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER W15P7T-09-R-K003.<br><br>SYNOPSIS FOR SOLICITATION W15P7T-09-R-K003<BR><BR>The United States Army CECOM Contracting Center  Army Contracting Command, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703, intends to procure, on a Sole Source basis, in accordance with (IAW) 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, with ULTRA Electronics Tactical Communication Systems, the High Capacity Line of Site (HCLOS) radios, installation kits (IKs), ancillary equipment, spare parts, and repair, training and technical support services.  The vehicle for this acquisition will be a five-year, Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Indefinite delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, with one, two-year option.

The IKs include necessary installation hardware such as cables and brackets for the installation of HCLOS radios into shelterized communication systems.  The shelterized communication systems are part of the WIN-T Increment-1 (WIN-T Inc-1) systems and provide tactical digital information over terrestrial data links.  The AN/GRC-245 HCLOS radio is the primary component of this system which will be fielded using the AN/TRC-190 radio assemblage modification kits, AN/TRC-198 radio assemblage kits, Patriot and USMC modification kits.  All interested parties may submit a proposal which will be considered.

<DESC>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities
(MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Skin Markers.

The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.

The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds Army Community Hospital (ACH), Fort Sill, OK; William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH, Fort Carson CO; Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS; 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV; and Bayne-Jones ACH, Fort Polk, LA.

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel and facilitated by Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.

The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.) Anticipated selection date is August 2009.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.
The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIA's.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Skin Markers product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Skin Markers product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.

B.	Products & Performance Required.

The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Skin Markers, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.
Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar demand of $18,118.93.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.

At the request of the Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor if deemed appropriate for the product line .

C.	Instructions to Vendors.
Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their responses with (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.  Submissions must be received by 3PM CDT on the specified closing date/time of the RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.

This process will require vendors to provide electronic responses to technical criteria upon request in the prescribed format of Microsoft Word, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes in the prescribed format of Microsoft Excel.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors need to confirm with the Central Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor must confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  

Responses should be sent to Mrs. Sarah Allen, sarah.allen.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil address; Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Mrs. Sarah Allen at (210) 292-3287 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.

D.	Evaluation Criteria.  

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  The Clinical Product Team (CPT) from the Central Region which is composed of Physicians, Nurses, Medical Technicians, Infection Control Officers and other clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products will develop and approve the technical/company and clinical/performance criteria as well as the evaluation process to be used along with the requirement for product sample sets and literature from the product group.  

Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.
Vendors are required to meet and provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.
NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:

1.  Vendors must provide a complete line of Product Line products.  A 'complete line of product' is defined as the MTFs' requirements for 'usage items' in the product line.  'Usage items' are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes: 
                                                   a.  Skin Marker, Single Tip
                                                   b.  Skin Marker with ruler

2. Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog,
etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.
3.  Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Product Line product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) 4.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal
Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be
disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.
5.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization
initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. 
6.  Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. 
7.  Products are scrub resistant.
8.  Ruler included in packaging.
 
Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent for evaluation as directed by the TRBO.
Vendors are required to ship their samples as directed by the TRBO and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive as instructed by COB, 3PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  The CPT will evaluate each vendor's product sample sets and literature against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 5 calendar days.
The evaluation responses will be in a Likert like scale format with a
1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (Not Acceptable - worst score), Two (Minimally Acceptable), Three (Acceptable), Four (Acceptable-High Side), Five (Highly Acceptable - best score).  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The CPT has established an overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  Vendors scoring below the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the CPT for final review and the clinically preferred product recommendation.

The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: 
  
Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0 

1. Skin Marker tip resists to blunting, fraying and linting.
2. Skin Marker ink does not smear.
3. Skin Marker does not damage the dermis.


Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.
Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  

After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  

Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).
The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendor's products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the DAPA price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.
The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 10 July 2009 3PM CDT

<DESC>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities
(MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Thermal Therapy.

The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.

The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel and facilitated by Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.

The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.) Anticipated selection date is August 2009.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Thermal Therapy product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Thermal Therapy can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.

B.	Products & Performance Required.

The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Thermal Therapy, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar demand of $57,666.44.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.

At the request of the Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor if deemed appropriate for the product line.

C.	Instructions to Vendors.

Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.  Submissions must be received by 3PM CDT on the specified closing date/time of this RFRIAQ.
Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.

This process will require vendors to provide electronic responses to technical criteria upon request in the prescribed format of Microsoft Word, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes in the prescribed format of Microsoft Excel.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors need to confirm with the Central Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor must confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  

Responses should be sent to Mrs. Sarah Allen, sarah.allen.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil address; Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Mrs. Sarah Allen at (210) 292-3287 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.

Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.
NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:

Technical/Company Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below:  
1.  Vendors must provide a complete line of Ear Protection Foam products.  A 'complete line of product' is defined as the MTFs'
requirements for 'usage items' in the product line.  'Usage items' are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes: Ear plugs, foam, in packs of two each. Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.
2.  Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Foam Ear Plugs product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) 3.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal
Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be
disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.
4.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization
initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. 
5.  Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. 

Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent for evaluation as directed by the TRBO.
Vendors are required to ship their samples as directed by the TRBO and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive as instructed by COB, 3PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  The CPT will evaluate each vendor's product sample sets and literature against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 5 calendar days.
The evaluation responses will be in a Likert like scale format with a
1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (Not Acceptable - worst score), Two (Minimally Acceptable), Three (Acceptable), Four (Acceptable-High Side), Five (Highly Acceptable - best score).  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The CPT has established an overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  Vendors scoring below the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the CPT for final review and the clinically preferred product recommendation.

The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: 

Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0 

1. Ear plug does not damage ear canal
       
2. Ear plug fits securely.
      
3. Ear Plug has smooth outer surface.
       

Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.
Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  

After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  

Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).
The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendor's products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the DAPA price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.
The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 10 July 2009 3PM CDT.

<SUBJECT>Penrose Drain (Central Region 6/7/8)
<SOLNBR>DADA09-09-T9023
<RESPDATE>071009
<CONTACT>Sarah Allen, Clinical Analyst, Phone 210 292-3287, Fax 210 292-3237, Email sarah.allen.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil - Kevin Hill, Technical Director, Phone 210 292-3270, Fax 210 292-3237, Email kevin.hill.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil
<DESC>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities
(MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Penrose Drain.

The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.

The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel and facilitated by Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.

The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.) Anticipated selection date is September 2009.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.
The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Penrose Drain product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Penrose Drain product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.

B.	Products & Performance Required.

The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Penrose Drain, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.
Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar demand of $55,936.86.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.

At the request of the Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor if deemed appropriate for the product line .

C.	Instructions to Vendors.
Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their responses with (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.  Submissions must be received by 3PM CDT on the specified closing date/time of the RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.

This process will require vendors to provide electronic responses to technical criteria upon request in the prescribed format of Microsoft Word, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes in the prescribed format of Microsoft Excel.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors need to confirm with the Central Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor must confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  

Responses should be sent to Mrs. Sarah Allen, sarah.allen.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil address; Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Mrs. Sarah Allen at (210) 292-3287 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.

D.	Evaluation Criteria.  

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  The Clinical Product Team (CPT) from the Central Region which is composed of Physicians, Nurses, Medical Technicians, Infection Control Officers and other clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products will develop and approve the technical/company and clinical/performance criteria as well as the evaluation process to be used along with the requirement for product sample sets and literature from the product group.  

Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.
Vendors are required to meet and provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.
NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:

Technical/Company Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below:  
1.  Vendors must provide a complete line of Penrose Drain products.  A 'complete line of product' is defined as the MTFs' requirements for 'usage items' in the product line.  'Usage items' are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes:  Penrose drain 18 inches long and 1 inch in diameter measurements.
2.  Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Product Line product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) 3.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal
Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be
disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.
4.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization
initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. 
5.  Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. 
6.  Product must be sterile.
7.  Products are individually packaged.

Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent for evaluation as directed by the TRBO.
Vendors are required to ship their samples as directed by the TRBO and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive as instructed by COB, 3PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  The CPT will evaluate each vendor's product sample sets and literature against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 5 calendar days.
The evaluation responses will be in a Likert like scale format with a
1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (Not Acceptable - worst score), Two (Minimally Acceptable), Three (Acceptable), Four (Acceptable-High Side), Five (Highly Acceptable - best score).  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The CPT has established an overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  Vendors scoring below the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the CPT for final review and the clinically preferred product recommendation.

The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: 

Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0 

1.  Package is easy to open in a sterile fashion.
     a.   Product packaging will be opened using sterile technique. 
     b.  This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting.
     c.  This product will be evaluated for ease of opening while maintaining a sterile field.
2.  Penrose Drain has a smooth finish.
      a.  The product is without abrasive edges which may cause damage to the dermis
      b.  This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting.
	c.  This product will be evaluated for smoothness and non-abrasive edges.

Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.
Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.

The containers or items shall be placed in a suitable pattern to form a stable and balanced load. Vertical, horizontal or filler reinforcement shall be added as necessary to meet the stacking strength requirements. A palletized load shall be secured to the pallet by shrink or stretch wrapping, and/or, by steel or nonmetallic strapping. When steel or nonmetallic strapping is used, edge protectors shall be provided to prevent damage to the cartons when tensioning the strapping. As a minimum, two straps shall run lengthwise, two straps shall run widthwise, and two straps shall run around the girth of the palletized load. A palletized load shall be capable of protecting the products against damage in a multiple handling, transportation, and storage environment having distribution warehouses with rack systems that support the load/s overhead of warehouse personnel.

Notice of special requirements for shipment to all countries that have endorsed the IPPC Guidelines for treatment of non-manufactured wood packaging:  The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) has approved and published on March 15, 2002, “Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging Material in International Trade”. Countries endorsing the IPPC Guidelines are found at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/swp/. Clause D-FSS-468 requires non-manufactured wood pallets and other non-manufactured wood packaging material used in shipments destined to IPPC compliant countries require the appropriate wood treatment.

<DESC>(RECOVERY ACT) The National Institute on Aging, IRP intends to negotiateand award a purchase order on a competitive basis (FAR 12.1, 12.102) an XF24 Extracelluar Flux Analyzer System.  This equipment will enhance and extend the Laboratory of Molecular Gerontology (LMG), research capabilities by allowing the lab to measure mitochondrial bioenergetics in real-time.  
In the Oxidative DNA Damage Processing and Mitochondria Functions Unit of LMG, the lab studies the response of mitochondria to DNA damaging agents at the cellular and enzymatic level.  The use of the XF24 analyzer will be instrumental in the continued development of the labs program ability to study mitochondria bioenergetics response after DNA damage.  The advantages of the XF24 analyzer is that it is a multifunctional instrument capable of simultaneously measuring oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production rate and extracellular acidification rates in living cells.  The XF24 technology uses a unique, optimized non-invasive methodology which allows real-time kinetic analysis because all of the measurement reagents are imbedded in sterile disposable cartridges.  Additionally, because the unit employs non-invasive technology during the analysis, the sample can be recovered for additional experimentation.  In the 24-well tissue culture plate format, the XF24 allows for the unprecedented ability to conduct high throughout analysis of cell lines or tissue samples.  This feature is required for LMGs program so that the lab can expand its repertoire of cells and tissues that can examined.  This notice may represent the only official notice.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT:  Announcement of Intent to Award Sole-Source Remedial Action Services to Sevenson Environmental Services, Inc., for the Cornell Dubilier Electronics, Inc., Superfund Site, South Plainfield, Middlesex County, New Jersey<BR><BR>This is a Sources Sought announcement with the intent to award a sole-source contract to Sevenson Environmental Services, Inc., under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Part 6.302.  In providing support for the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District intends to issue a sole source, site specific contract for completing the remedial action associated with Operable Unit 2 (OU2) of the Cornell Dubilier Electronics, Inc. (CDE) Superfund Site (the Site).  The original task order for work at the Site was competed among four firms on the Pre-placed remedial action contract (PRAC), which is a small business set-aside, multiple award task order contract.  The four firms under the PRAC were selected through a formal competitive procurement process.<BR><BR>Award of the OU2 CDE work was made by Kansas City District to Sevenson Environmental Services, Inc., under contract W912DQ-04-D-0023, Task Order 0011.  Work under OU2 consists of completing a CERCLA remedial action involving the excavation and subsequent onsite treatment of contaminated soils through low temperature thermal desorption (LTTD) technology in accordance with the Record of Decision and the Remedial Design for the Site.  Work awarded to date under W912DQ-04-D-0023, Task Order 0011 consists of work plan preparation, subcontractor consent package preparation and approvals, air permitting activities for the LTTD unit, soil erosion and sediment control certification activities, wastewater discharge permitting activities, mobilization and maintenance of temporary facilities, mobilization of an LTTD unit, securing utility clearances and utility connections, characterization sampling and waste profiling, excavation of soils, and other general conditions associated with Site remediation.  Due to overall capacity shortfalls on contract W912DQ-04-D-0023, the Kansas City District intends to issue a sole source, site-specific contract for logical follow-on work in order to complete the remedial action associated with contaminated soils and site restoration activities for OU2.<BR><BR>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the work and services described herein is 562910.  Requirements for this remedy include excavation of contaminated soil containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at concentrations greater than 500 mg/kg and contaminated soils that exceed New Jersey's impact to Groundwater Soil Cleanup Criteria (IGWSCC) for contaminants other than PCBs.  Onsite treatment of excavated soil amenable to treatment LTTD technology is required.  Excavated areas are to be backfilled with treated soils and supplemented as necessary with clean backfill.  Contaminated soils and debris not suitable for on-site LTTD treatment will be transported offsite for disposal, and where necessary treated offsite prior to disposal.  Site restoration includes installation of a multi-layer cap or hardscape, installation of engineering controls and other property restoration activities.  Attached to this Source Sought are the plans and specifications that fully describe the projects requirements.<BR><BR>A critical component of the project is the contractor furnished and operated LTTD unit.  The LTTD unit will be equipped with desorption chambers, an air pollution control system, a control room, a material handling system and all necessary incidentals required for a complete temporary onsite treatment system.  The LTTD unit requires a nominal throughput capacity of 18 tons per hour.  The remedy does not allow for an incinerator or direct-fired system.<BR><BR>The Government is currently in the process of gaining local and state regulatory permit equivalencies and approvals required to execute the work. This includes an NJDEP Air Quality Permit Equivalency, in accordance with NJAC 7:27-8.  The Governments current contractor will have an NJDEP Air Quality Permit Equivalency approved by the State on or before September 2009.  The Government is also pursuing a soil erosion and sediment control plan certification in accordance with the requirements of the Freehold Soil Conservation District, and an indirect discharge permit equivalency with the Middlesex County Utilities Authority to discharge pretreated wastewater into the local POTW (Publically Owned Treatment Works).<BR><BR>Subcontractor procurement has been completed for the air permit equivalency, mobilization of the LTTD unit to the Site, system performance testing, and full-scale Operation and Maintenance (O&M), land surveying services, analytical laboratory services, asphalt paving services, aggregate and backfill material supplier, electrical services, plumbing services, site security services, perimeter air monitoring services, and site office trailers and temporary material handling structures.  The following workplans have been completed and approved, or are in the process of being approved:  Site Health and Safety Plan, Air Monitoring Plan, Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan, Sampling and Analysis Plan, Contractor Quality Control Plan, Site Security Plan, Temporary Site facilities Layout Plan, Excavation and Material Handling Plan, Waste Management Plan, Lead Compliance Plan, Housekeeping Plan, and Quality of Life Engineering Plan. <BR><BR>With regard to scheduling with the incumbent contractor:  The Government intends to complete the LTTD unit mobilization on or before October 2009.  Completion of the LTTD system performance testing will be achieved by October 2009, with full-scale system Operation and Maintenance from October 2009 to January 2011.  It is the Governments intent to achieve completion of the remedial action for OU2 by September 2011.<BR><BR>The Governments intent of issuing a site-specific sole source contract for logical follow-on work is based on the avoidance of duplication of costs, on the concerns regarding substantial project delays, and on the potential for loss of the earned value of work performed to date under the current task order.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR QUOTATIONS.  However, firms interested in submitting their capabilities to execute this project may submit information for consideration by the Government (as described below).<BR><BR>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Any information received will be considered for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement and will become a part of the market research for this acquisition.  Firms intending to provide submittals in response to this Sources Sought must submit detailed information indicating their ability to meet the Governments requirements.  Any offeror responding to this notice must show a viable method to mobilize a low temperature thermal desorption unit to the site per the requirements of the remedial design and complete applicable local and state regulatory permit equivalencies and approvals including the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Air Quality Permit Equivalency, in accordance with New Jersey Administrative Code 7:27-8, in accordance with the Governments schedule (as described above).<BR><BR>Potential sources are requested to submit a capability statement that addresses the following key areas:   <BR><BR>1.	CAPABILITY:  Potential sources must provide information describing their ability to meet project requirements and the schedule outlined previously in this sources sought request.

If the potential source believes it can self perform the LTTD treatment, information regarding the current location of its LTTD unit should be provided.  This information should also include any modifications needed to meet the plans and specifications and a schedule for mobilization of the LTTD unit to the site.<BR>2.	BUSINESS SIZE: Potential sources shall identify if they are a large, small, 8(a) program participants, small dis-advantaged certified, HUB-zone certified, woman or veteran-owned businesses.<BR>3.	COST:  Potential sources are requested to provide estimated costs to fully mobilize and commence work on the project site, provide an estimated unit cost for the transportation and disposal of soils on site, provide an estimated unit cost for the disposal of soils off-site, provide an estimated unit cost for processing materials through the LTTD unit, and an estimated cost for demobilization.<BR>4.

Mills Dam (L&D-2) and at Joe Hardin Lock and Dam (L&D-3).  They function as an integral part of a matched Tainter Gate Hoist system which is a vital-link in the Government operated navigation and flood-water control system.  The replacement manufacturer shall have a minimum of 10-years of experience fabricating dam tainter-gate gearboxes plus proven reliability and accountability: such as Foote-Jones Division of Regal-Beloit Corp, Lufkin Industries Inc, Philadelphia Gear Corp, or equal.<BR><BR>1.2 There are 16 tainter-gates at L&D-2 and 18 tainter-gates at L&D-3.  Each tainter-gate has a left-hand gearbox and a right-hand gearbox.  In addition, there shall be four spares (2-LH & 2-RH).  It is essential that replacement universal gearboxes are interchangeable and fit in form and functionality for a bolt-in swap (three-dimensional footprint) without modification.   The manufacturer/supplier shall be solely responsible for developing this interchangeability scenario (see paragraph GEARBOX DESCRIPTION).  <BR>NOTE: Certification of authenticity and compliance with the three-dimensional footprint matching (including ancillary component connections) shall be furnished with pricing.<BR><BR>2. GEARBOX  DESCRIPTION: <BR><BR>2.1  Universal Gearbox with left-hand configuration shall replace a Foote-Jones, Model 14-H3.  NOTE: Corps of Engineers definition, left-hand is on the left descending-bank side of the river (or tainter gate).<BR>2.2.1 Typical serial numbers (for information only):<BR>	a) L&D-02, (Tainter Gate-01), typical, Serial Number 366215/1/25, ratio 142.58:1<BR>	b) L&D-03, (Tainter Gate-01), typical, Serial Number 366413/14, ratio 142.58:1<BR>2.1.2 Fabrication shall include the following provisions and/or capabilities: <BR>2.1.2.1 Cast-iron or steel-weldment housing, thru-hardened gearing, antifriction roller bearings, splash lubrication<BR>2.1.2.2 Operating gear-ratio is 142.58:1 (same as the existing)<BR>2.1.2.3 Universal bolt-in three-dimensional footprint replacement (between L&D-2 and 3)<BR>2.1.2.3.1 Housing dimensions (mounting-base size, mounting-base connection, split-line height, etc.)<BR>2.1.2.3.2 Input-shaft (high-speed, height, location, diameter, plus opposite-side output-stub for line-shaft connection)<BR>2.1.2.3.3 Output-shaft (slow-speed, height, location, diameter, length to fit the longest application (NOTE: shaft lengths are different), removable pinion gear.<BR>2.1.2.3.4 Removable pinion-gears for L&D-2 and L&D-3 shall be matched to fit the existing Tainter Gate bull-gear. <BR>  NOTE-1: Pinion gears are the same.  <BR>  NOTE-2: Pinion gears shall be shipped installed.<BR>2.1.2.3.5 Exterior painted surface shall be Industrial Gray in color.<BR>2.1.2.3.6 Exterior non-painted surfaces and all gears shall be protected (coated) to prevent rusting because installation will not be timely.  <BR>2.1.2.3.7 Interior gears and surfaces shall be protected (coated) to prevent rusting because installation will not be timely.  <BR>2.1.2.3.8 Shut-off valve to a drain-port and a site-gage that indicates all oil levels (from low-to-high).<BR>NOTE-1. Considering the usage (sitting on the sill for a long time then moving in the up direction), the oil level needs maintaining at a higher level than the factory recommendations.  The lowest allowable level is where the bottom surface of the intermediate-slow-shaft remains immersed in oil at all times (or the bottom gear-tooth-surface of the small-gear).  This emersion will provide almost immediate oiling, instead of temporary oil-starvation until the gate raises approximately one foot (or the slow-shaft large-gear has made one full revolution when operated in the upward direction).  The high level (full) should be 1/2-inch below the split line.<BR>NOTE-2. If the site-gage is accidentally broken, the gearbox will not drain.<BR>2.1.2.3.9 Reversible capabilities (for a right-hand configuration)<BR>  NOTE-1: Supplier shall field verify dimensions to guarantee the fit requirement.<BR>  NOTE-2: If there are any discrepancies between the existing gearboxes and the information in<BR>                  paragraph 2.1.2, the information in paragraph 2.1.2 shall govern.  <BR>2.1.3 The total number of left-hand gearboxes is 35.<BR><BR>2.2 Universal Gearbox with right-hand configuration shall replace a Foote-Jones, Model 14-H3.

<DESC><p>Headquarters Air Combat Command, Acquisition Management and Integration Center (HQ ACC/AMIC), Langley AFB VA, intends to award a non-competitive, sole source, bridge contract award for a one month base and two one (1) month option to Kforce Government Solutions, Inc (KGS) (formerly RDI dNovus) to continue critical operations, technical support, and services on all information technology and network equipment under command and control of ACC's 83d Network Operations Squadron (83 NOS). This requirement is for information technology services and network support for the 83 NOS operations through a wide range of highly specialized technical services for enterprise event management, network assistance, network control and management, network defense operations, network core services management, and associated network operations management support functions. The support services include equipment located at the primary work location in the Integrated Network Operations and Security Center-East enterprise environment at Langley AFB, Hampton VA and at additional work location in the Integrated Network Operations and Security Center-West enterprise environment at Peterson AFB, Colorado Springs CO and Randolph AFB, San Antonio TX. The work also includes maintenance and management of warranty services to sustain, monitor, administer, refresh, and improve support for 83 NOS Enterprise Network Operations. 83 NOS is a conduit between Air Force bases and higher echelons of Air Force Network Operations and the Department of Defense-supporting 650,000 users, and 800,000 systems. KGS currently provides the ITS contract services to keep the network fully operational.

2. The X-ray source should have a brilliance exceeding to 7.5 x 1010 X-rays/mm2/sec fluence at the sample position through a 0.1mm crystal size aperture with divergence no greater than 4.8mR and a beam size at the sample of no larger than 210&#61549;m.  The aperture size is dictated by the typical size of the crystals that will be employed in this Laboratory, and the divergence is such that Bragg spacings of at least 300 Å can be routinely resolved.

3. The X-ray generator should have a focal size below 0.1 mm in order to achieve optimal signal-to-noise ratios at the detector.

4. The X-ray generator should have filaments that are easily changed and aligned, both to minimize downtime and the need for service by the supplier.

5. The area detector should be based on imaging plate technology because of its proven performance, ease of operation and maintenance, and cost-performance.  A dual-plate instrument is required to provide redundancy, should one imaging plate be damaged.

6. The cryogenic system should be able to operate using house nitrogen gas, rather than a nitrogen generator or liquid nitrogen.  Because of the limited space available for the facility, it is not possible routinely to provide liquid nitrogen tanks for data collection.

7. In order to simplify maintenance calls, it is desirable to have a system solution provided by a single vendor, rather than sourcing components from different manufacturers.

This sole source acquisition therefore is justified under the authority contained in 41 U.S.C. 253 (1) and FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2), states that: When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements full and open competition need not be provided for.

Thursday, June 25, 2009
9:00 AM to 12 Noon  (CST)

Will Rogers Memorial Center
3401 W. Lancaster Avenue
Fort Worth, TX  76107

We invite you to the GSA Stimulus Forum to learn the latest information about GSA’s implementation of Recovery Plan projects and initiatives that will take place in our five-state region, which includes Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.

We will begin the Forum with an overview of GSA’s Recovery Plan and provide the location, funding, project descriptions and timing on the 33 projects slated for action across this region.  Since the Recovery Plan is meant to stimulate the economy as quickly as possible, many of these projects will be carried out by current GSA contractors.  However, there will still be a number of prime and subcontracting opportunities available for new contractors.

We will also provide useful information on participating in GSA’s Schedule Program and teaming arrangements.  The Forum will conclude with a question and answer session with GSA contracting officers and project managers.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funds measures necessary to convert Federal facilities into high-performance green buildings.  GSA will renovate and construct Federal buildings, courthouses and land ports of entry.  We are looking for cost effective, high quality and environmentally friendly commercial products and services.

There is no cost to attend the Forum, but we ask you to pre-register by sending an e-mail to R7smallbiz@gsa.gov with the following information.  The parking is FREE.

The LCR meter performs automatic sweeps of frequency, amplitude, or bias (linear or logarithmic) in both impedance and gain/phase modes, has a null feature that provides the ability to cancel out residual impedance of test leads and a normalized feature that offsets all future measurements against a test fixture and cabling frequency response, and the LCR meter meets basic measurement accuracy of 0.1%, 0.1 in impedance mode applied from 5& to 100K&, and has frequency range of 10uHz to 32MHz.  The potentiostat makes both true analog and digital DC sweeps in both potentiostat and galvanostatic modes, two 5 x 9 digital voltmeters that allow simultaneous voltage and current measurements, has both floating and grounded connections to be used with floating and grounded equipment, meets or exceeds published expectations, has a resolution down to 1uV for reference electrode and 1pA for working electrode, has driven shields to allow for high frequency impedance measurements over full 10Hz to 1MHz frequency range and the potentiostat is designed to work exclusively with Zplot and Corrware Software packages. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 10:00 a.m. CST on 24 June 2009.

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service has a requirement for two-phase design build at the White Mountain National Forest located on the Pemigewasset Ranger District, Grafton County.  The projects begin approximately 0.2 miles south of US Highway 3 on Road #92, approximately 3 miles southeast of Bethlehem, NH.  The project will consist of road reconstruction and road bridges replacement.  The major work items include complete survey, design, fabrication and construction of several sections totaling approximately 0.6 miles of South Gale Road, NFSR #92.  This is a single-lane collector road with aggregate and asphalt surfacing through the length.  The purpose of the design is to restore the roadway sections to the correct template, provide stability, improve drainage and replace aggregate surfacing.  The project will include the replacement of three road bridges numbered 92-0.3, 92-0.5 and 92-0.7.  The bridges are all single span treated timber bridges with solid sawn timbers, nail laminated deck and timber wall abutments.  The design shall remove all existing structures and abutments and replace with new structures suitable for the sites.  Salvageable materials, such as undamaged stringers are to be delivered to the Forest Service.  The project also includes repairs, in-kind of road bridge number 92-1.2.  This bridge is also a single-span treated timber bridge.  Repairs shall include repair to the abutments, installing a wearing surface and the replacement of riprap stream armor.

The resulting solicitation will be a Request for Proposal utilizing the Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures of FAR 36.3.  The outcome will be a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  All Design Build teams responding during Phase One will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria:  1) Past experience.  The Prime Contractor’s past bridge design and construction experiences shall be shown on similar projects completed over the past five years.  Experience is relevant when the offeror has been confronted with the kinds of work or challenges that will be present under the contract contemplated.  The offeror will be assessed by the relevant experience on the basis of its breadth and its depth.  For each relevant contract or reference, the offeror shall provide a) name and location of the project. b) Contact name and phone number of customer or their agent. c) Whether the offeror was the prime contractor or a subcontractor. d) List of subcontractors and suppliers used. d) Brief description of project and work performed. 2) Past performance.  Experience is relevant when the offeror has satisfied performance factors with customers in the past and complied with Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.  The assessment of past performance will be subjective, and based mainly on the offeror’s reputation with their customers and others.  Previous references will be contacted for information regarding their opinion on the following: a) capability, efficiency and effectiveness. b) Performance conformed to the terms and conditions of the contract. c) Reasonableness and cooperation during performance. d) Commitment to quality work and timely completion.  Offerors with no past performance will be rated as “Neutral” in this category and not necessarily be rejected. 3) Staffing.  Provide names and titles of key personnel to be assigned to the project, i.e. Design Engineer, Structural Engineer, Project manager, Project Superintendent, project Foreman, and Quality Control Inspector.  The key personnel shall be shown in an organization chart relative to each person’s role.  Indicate the qualifications of key personnel listed, showing at a minimum their experience and education.  4) Quality Control and Quality Assurance Plan.  Submit a proposed quality control and quality assurance plan for the project, which shall include a minimum all testing and inspections required in the contract.  The quality control and quality assurance plan shall also include, but not be limited to, all supplier and plant inspection companies, including their responsibilities.  5) Project Schedule.  A proposed schedule shall be included with the offer which shall include, but not be limited to, submission of 35% review, 95% review and final design, construction startup and schedule.  

The highest rated offerors from Phase One will be selected to submit Phase Two proposals.  The competitive range will not exceed five unless the Contracting Officer determines that a number greater than five is in the government’s best interest.  The Government will notify those offerors that did not make the competitive range and will not be considered for further evaluations.  Those firms making the competitive range will be sent a Request for Proposal and evaluated to determine best value on the following factors:  1) Past experience (same as phase I).  2) Past performance (same as phase I) 3) Staffing (same as phase I). 4) Quality control and quality assurance plan (same as phase I) 5) Project schedule (same as phase I).  6) Conceptual site plans and designs.  7) Sustainability and 8) Price Proposal.  The Government reserves the right to negotiate with any or all offers or award without discussion and negotiations on this phase of the solicitation to the offeror submitting the best value.  Cost for submission of price and technical proposals will not be compensated.

The total estimated budget for this entire project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.

Proposals will be reviewed to determine which one represents the greatest value, price and other factors considered.  Award will not necessarily be made to the lowest priced offeror, but rather the one that offers the best value to the National Park Service in terms of the following evaluation criteria.  
Evaluation criteria are listed in descending order of importance.    1. Past Performance - Weight = 0 - 40 points	
Evaluation will be performed only for existing and prior contracts for work similar in nature and complexity to that required by the solicitation and will include the following:
A. Quality of Products and Services.  Demonstrated ability to perform sign fabrication, engineering, design, installation, and production services in accordance with required design specifications. Conformance to good standards of workmanship and quality control. (0-10)
B. Customer Satisfaction.  Satisfaction of end users with the completed signs and/or sign components. (0-10)
C. Timeliness of Performance.  Compliance with delivery schedules; reliability; and responsiveness to technical direction. (0-10)
D. Business Relations.  Effective management, ability to manage projects involving subcontracts, working relationship with the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer's Representatives, reasonable/cooperative behavior, flexibility, effective contractor recommended solutions, businesslike concern for government interests, and provides current, accurate, and complete billings. (0-10)
In the case of an offeror with respect to which there is no information on past contract performance, or with respect to which information on past contract performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on the factor of past contract performance. In other words, past performance will be treated as neutral. This will be accomplished by giving a new firm the average score of the other competing offeror's and evaluating the proposal in accordance with the other stated evaluation criteria, (FAR 15.608(2)(iii)).
2. Comprehensive Plan including Quality Control - Weight = 0 - 30 points
Evaluation will be based on the adequacy and feasibility of the Comprehensive Plan including Project Management. Special emphasis will be placed on the Project Manager, the techniques employed, and how well the technical and management approaches will ensure the quality, timeliness, and effectiveness of finished products.
3. Samples of Work - Weight = 0 - 20 points
Evaluation will be based on samples of work that demonstrate the ability of proposed personnel and subcontractors to manage and produce graphics and structures that are similar in design and function to signs and sign components to be fabricated as part of this contract.
4. Personnel - Weight = 0 - 10 points
Evaluation will be based on the qualifications, education, knowledge, and work experience of all personnel, including subcontractors, proposed for use under the contract.  Special emphasis will be placed on personnel's training and/or experience in the fabrication of graphics or similar types of fabrication.
Award Criteria:	
The government anticipates award of one firm-fixed-price contract resulting from this solicitation.  A contract will be made to that responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, cost or price and other factors considered. Technical quality, including past performance, will be considered more important than cost or price. Warranty information as well as life cycle cost considerations will be included in the best value determination.  
While price will be a factor in the award decision, the award may not necessarily be made to that offeror submitting the lowest price. Likewise, award will not necessarily be made for technical capabilities that would appear to exceed those needed for the successful performance of the work. A thorough examination will be made to determine an offeror's adequate understanding of the Scope of Work related to proposal presentation, price (including materials) and other factors considered. The question to be decided in making the final selection will be whether proposals scoring better are worth the dollar difference (if any).
As proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important. As the technical merit and the evaluated cost or price become essentially equal, other factors may become the determining factor.
The government will consider other factors, as listed below in descending order of importance, secondary to technical, geographical disbursement, and cost or price;
(1) HubZone small business concerns;(2) Small business concerns which are also minority owned and operated; (3) Women-owned firms; and(4) Service-disabled veteran-owned small business firms.
In addition to the evaluation of technical merit, the cost, or price, and other factors, the standards for determining an offeror's responsibility as set forth in FAR 9.104-1, will be examined and considered. Additional factors which are not specifically set forth in this solicitation, but which are prerequisites for award as implied by law, regulation or public policy will be considered in the determination of an offeror's acceptability.Attachment K, Intention to Propose, should be submitted on or before June 24, 2009.  Technical proposals should be submitted in an original and four copies and business proposals should be submitted in an original and one copy for receipt no later than 4:00 p.m., EST, July 6, 2009, and shall be clearly marked with Request for Proposal Number N1105090011.  Offerors are hereby notified that if your proposal is not received by the date and time and at the location specified in this announcement that it will be considered late in accordance with FAR Part 52.212.1(f).  
Technical and business proposals should be sent to the National Park Service; Harpers Ferry Center; Office of Acquisition Management; Attention: Melody Wolfe, Contract Specialist; Request for Proposal Number N1105090011; P.O. Box 50; Harpers Ferry, West Virginia 25425-0050.  Proposals by telephone transmitted facsimile (fax) or electronic mail will not be accepted.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. 

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Onbudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through frank and open discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.The solicitation number is VA-776-09-RQ-0135 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ) using Simplified Acquisition Procedures found in FAR 13.1. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-29. This solicitation is unrestricted; the associated NAICS code is 511210. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. STATEMENT OF WORK FOR CROSSWALK DATA FILESA.1. SCOPE OF WORK:The Contractor shall provide all resources necessary to complete the deliverables and accomplish the Tasks described in this Statement of Work (SOW) except as may otherwise be specified.The VHA has a need to utilize crosswalk data files to link the most recent version of the American Medical Association published Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) values against both the Internal Classification of Disease, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis and procedural terms.  VA will make this file available to a wide variety of data analysts throughout the Department of Veterans Affairs.   The VA must be able to move in either direction from ICD-9-CM to CPT or from CPT to ICD-9-CM when performing data analysis.  The contractor shall provide the information in the data file necessary to link these codes.  The contractor is responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining data content using specified applications and data exchange formats in accordance with the statement of work and established VA standards.  The work required in this statement of work shall be consistent with the licensing of new terminologies in cooperation with other Federal agencies as appropriate and at the conclusion of this effort; VA will retain rights to all configuration, customization, and custom-built software.A.2. BACKGROUND:The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) utilizes Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modifications (ICD-9-CM) codes for recording work performed by clinical staff whether in an inpatient or ambulatory setting and also uses the diagnosis codes to record patient disease identified by clinical staff.  VA collects this information in its electronic health record and in various national data bases providing both a rich analytical environment for research purposes and for managerial oversight.  Historically, to do this analysis, the employees used reference books in an attempt to cross reference the codes.  This process limited their ability to review larger numbers of records.  A.3. OBJECTIVE:VA intends to facilitate additional research in its national data bases by providing reference information that establishes a match among CPT and ICD-9-CM codes.  The Veterans Health Administration intends to use the data files establishing links among CPT and ICD9-CM diagnosis and procedure codes for data analysis. The scope of work in this contract will not involve any Personal Health Information (PHI).A.4. PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  The Contractor shall provide the data files contained in this SOW in accordance to the approved project plan.  The period of performance shall be 12 months from date of award with 3 options years renewed at the governments preference annually.  There are ten (10) Federal holidays set by law (USC Title 5 Section 6103):Under current definitions, four are set by date:New Year's Day			January 1Independence Day			July 4Veterans Day				November 12 (observed)Christmas Day				December 25If any of the above falls on a Saturday, then Friday shall be observed as a holiday.  Similarly, if one falls on a Sunday, then Monday shall be observed as a holiday.The other six are set by a day of the week and month:Martin Luther King's Birthday	Third Monday in JanuaryWashington's Birthday		Third Monday in FebruaryMemorial Day			Last Monday in MayLabor Day			First Monday in SeptemberColumbus Day			Second Monday in OctoberThanksgiving			Fourth Thursday in NovemberA.5. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	  Contractor SiteA.6. TRAVEL:No travel for this contract is expected.  A.7.TYPE OF CONTRACT:	Firm - Fixed Price A.8.

However, if additional charges are assessed during the license period as a result of negotiated changes in the license (e.g., CPU upgrades), the license fee shall be by mutual agreement of the parties and any dispute thereof shall be resolved in accordance with the Disputes Clause incorporated herein at FAR 52.212-4(g).If the Government desires to continue using a term software license and/or receive upgrades and support for a perpetual software license beyond the license period identified in this Order or Contract, the Government will issue a separate order or contract to renew the term license and/or the maintenance and annual support agreements.  Conversely, if an order or contract to renew the software license, support and upgrade license is not received, no assumption by the Contractor shall be made that license has been renewed.Unless otherwise agreed, for any new additional software that may be licensed, the Contractor shall provide for software maintenance and technical support in the first year of the license at no additional price.The Contractor shall provide software support services, which include periodic updates, enhancements and corrections to the software, and reasonable technical support, all of which are customarily provided by the Contractor to its customers so as to cause the software to perform according to its specifications, documentation or demonstrated claims.  Any telephone support provided by Contractor shall be at no additional cost.The Contractor shall provide all support services in a timely manner in accordance with the Contractor's customary practice.  However, prolonged delay in resolving software problems will be noted in the Government's various past performance records on the Contractor (e.g., In December 2000, the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board), pursuant to Section 508(2)(A) of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998, established Information Technology accessibility standards for the Federal Government.  Section 508(a)(1) requires that when Federal departments or agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use Electronic and Information Technology (EIT), they shall ensure that the EIT allows Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of information and data by other Federal employees.  The Section 508 requirement also applies to members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal department or agency.If the Government allows the software maintenance and technical support to lapse and subsequently wishes to reinstate it, any reinstatement fee charged shall not exceed the amounts that would have been charged if the Government had not allowed it to lapse. h.	Disaster Recovery Clause:  Government hereby certifies to Contractor that it has a bona fide disaster plan with respect to the computer software programs used in its operations.  The Contract and/or Order authorizes the Government's operation to maintain a second copy of software on tape for use at loading at sites that are not live (e.g. subscription-based disaster recovery services) for the sole purpose of duplicating or mirroring the software environment of the "primary" licenses at the designated licensed site and as described herein.  Additionally, use of the software at the contingency sites must not include general access or any processing for program development or production.  Contractor shall permit operation and testing of all licensed programs at the contingency sites as designated by the Government without prior approval and at no additional cost to the Government solely for the purpose of maintaining or implementing disaster recovery readiness including continuity of business operations.  CPU's, MIPS or MSU's at these contingency sites are excluded from the total CPU's, MIPS or MSU's count included elsewhere in the Contract and/or Order and are not separately billable.  Activation of operations at a contingency site shall be at Government's discretion.  Government is authorized to install all software at the contingency sites for testing, problem resolution purposes, and to ensure there will be no operational delays in association with transition of workload from the designated licensed site to the contingency sites.  Use of the software at the contingency sites in the event of a disaster shall continue until such time as normal processing can be resumed at the "primary" site regardless of the duration required.  Nothing in the Contract and/or Order diminishes the Government's rights in accordance with the data rights clause(s).  Any license keys, codes, or passwords required by the Contractor in order to use the software at the contingency sites shall be provided to the Government within 10 days of the Government's request.Disabling Software Code:  The Government requires delivery of computer software that does not contain any code that will, upon the occurrence or the nonoccurrence of any event, disable the software.  Such code includes but is not limited to a computer virus, restrictive key, node lock, time-out or other function, whether implemented by electronic, mechanical, or other means, which limits or hinders the use or access to any computer software based on residency on a specific hardware configuration, frequency of duration of use, or other limiting criteria.  If any such code is present, the Contractor agrees to indemnify the Government for all damages suffered as a result of a disabling caused by such code, and the Contractor agrees to remove such code upon the Government's request at no extra cost to the Government.  Inability of the Contractor to remove the disabling software code will be considered an inexcusable delay and a material breach of the contract and the Government may exercise its right to terminate for cause.  In addition, the Government is permitted to remove the code as it deems appropriate and charge the Contractor for consideration for the time and effort in removing the code.3.  Invoicing:a.

All non-price factors, when combined, are more important than price.1) Technical Capability:  Technical capability is defined as an contractor's proposed solution(s) and demonstrated ability to do the type of work described by this SOW, and is determined on the basis of the following sub-factors (the sub-factors are equal in importance): "	Data ease of use and compatibility and interoperability"	Methodology for ensuring the most up to date information and references provided to the customers"	Proposed update schedule for data1.	Past Experience:  Past performance is relevant information regarding an offeror's actions under previously awarded contracts.  It includes the offeror's overall quality of performance, record of conforming to contract requirements and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the responsiveness of management; the offeror's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, including the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer; and the offeror's overall performance on their contracts.  This information will be obtained through feedback from the offeror's customers.  To be relevant, past performance information must be provided for contracts that are similar (or greater) in terms of the relevant past performance criteria listed below.  Contracts submitted may have been Governmental (federal, state, or local) or private sector contracts.  Past performance will be considered relevant if it meets all of the following criteria:  1)  As a prime contractor, offeror provided data to IT Services for a Health Care Organization2)  Contract was valued at or in excess of $ 50,000 per year3)  Software that included maintenance for a period of at least one year in length3)  Products were provided within the last three yearsOfferor's shall complete Attachment A - Past Performance References Sheet at the end of this section.

If the offeror submits as a joint venture, unless the references submitted are for the joint venture, each firm in the joint venture will be evaluated and the composite score will be the average of all the scores for each firm of the joint venture. While offerors must submit evidence of a minimum of 3 customer references for past performance evaluations, they may provide more (but in no case shall they submit more than 5 references.  (The Government will consider two separate contracts as a single contract if they were consecutive and for the same location and services; e.g., two separate, but consecutive, one-year elevator maintenance service contracts for the same or similar work at ABC Federal Building, will be considered one contract.)  The Government is not required to conduct or complete reference checks on more than 3 contracts, although it may choose to do so.  Additionally, if more than 3 references are provided, the Government reserves the right to choose which references to include in its evaluation.         In addition to those references provided directly by the offeror, the Contracting Officer may identify and analyze the past performance of the offeror on any other relevant contract that they currently have or had of which the Contracting Officer has knowledge or obtains knowledge, including but not limited to projects listed in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).  Because of the wide variety of past performance history of individual offerors, the Government is not required to ensure that an equal number of references be obtained for each offeror.SOLICITATION PROVISIONS:The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to offerors-Commercial Items (June 2008), applies to this acquisition. The provision at FAR 52-212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999), applies to this acquisition.

Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication or protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. (b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). (c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsman Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-668, email: Michael.Jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreement, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/ACQ, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. (d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. (e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

Governments Respose: Yes used containers are okay, but no visible damages to the inside or outside of the container.
Question 2)  Is there an age criteria with regard to these 20' containers if you do accept used containers?  
Governments Response: Within a year to five (5) years old.
Question 3)  Will the customer provide lift equipment at the delivery points? 
Governments Response: No, total delivery of container should be the vendor responsibility.
Question 4)  Is there a specific paint number associated with the color "beige"? Is Desert Tan acceptable? 
Governments Response: No, paint number Beige is requested, but, Desert Tan will be acceptable.
Question 5) Just for clarification, are we required to charge New Mexico sales tax (5%) and Navajo Nation tax (4%)?

<p>AmeriCorps*NCCC - Statement of Work - for<br />SAFETY and FIRE BOOTS</p>
<p>1. HISTORY: AmeriCorps*NCCC is a residential national service program operated by the Corporation for National and Community Service. The AmeriCorps*NCCC mission is to strengthen communities and develop leaders through team-based national and community service. Built on the legacy of the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s, AmeriCorps*NCCC is premised on the belief that civic responsibility is an inherent duty of all citizens and that national service can effectively solve local problems while providing opportunities to learn practical skills and engender a life-long commitment of service to others. The AmeriCorps*NCCC mission is accomplished through the engagement of young people ages 18 - 24 in team based service on projects in local communities throughout designated regions of the country.</p>
<p>2. GENERAL: Our program requires the members to work on construction sites, trails, and other rigorous work sites that make it imperative they wear safety boots. Non-steel toe boots are also necessary to support the wild fire fighting mission. Therefore, an experienced provider is needed to deliver and fit the boots they provide at the time of fitting. This is with the exception of fire boots since they will be provided according to size fitted when the members arrive.</p>
<p>3. SERVICE NEED: AmeriCorps*NCCC's campuses require a safety boot provider for new volunteers (referred to as members throughout this document). There are four types of boots requested. One is a standard steel-toe boot, a composite-toe boot for cold climates, a summer service safety boot, and a wild fire boot. Specific specifications are provided in Section 4 (Boot Specifications). Campuses normally commence in two seasons-fall and winter. These openings may change at the discretion of the Corporation and the provider must provide on-site fittings of boots that coincide with the arrival or our members.</p>
<p>4. BOOT SPECIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>A. SAFETY (STEEL TOE) BOOT SPECIFICATIONS: <br />&bull; 8" tall lace Boot with a steel safety toe that meets or exceeds ANSI<br />&bull; Z41-PT99 standards<br />&bull; Black Full Grain Oil Tan Leather Upper<br />&bull; All around, full Goodyear welt construction<br />&bull; Fully lined in Cambrelle w/10mm foam between lining and upper<br />&bull; All cambrelle sock liner w/12mm foam padding<br />&bull; Deep Lug, yellow plug, carbon impregnated oil-resistant outsole<br />&bull; Security stitch outsole<br />&bull; Leather stitch and turn collar<br />&bull; 8 Iron neoprene rubber midsole<br />&bull; Leather finger loop in backstay<br />&bull; 64" black taslan nylon laces<br />&bull; One rivet for strength added to the end of each lacing stay at side of vamp<br />&bull; Leather tongue, lined w/cambrelle and padded w/10mm foam<br />&bull; 5 rust resistant bottom hex shaped black eyelets<br />&bull; 3 rust resistant black hooks at ankle<br />&bull; 1 rust resistant bottom hex shaped black eyelets<br />&bull; Available in sizes 3 to 15 in narrow, medium, and wide widths that adequately fit male and female members</p>

<DESC>This amendment changes the following:<BR><BR>Proposal delivery instructions<BR>Points of contact <BR>Software delivery date<BR><BR>The revised synopsis/solicitation follows:<BR><BR>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  Based upon comprehensive market research including demonstration of CAM application software, the Government deems that only one source can meet ALL of the Governments requirements to match the machine tools in use at this facility, specific operations and rapid prototyping methods (to include importing the design feature tree along with native ProEngineering three dimensional solid models).  That source is DP Technology Corporation.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all proposals received by the due date and time in this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses received to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   However, the statement of work that applies to any award is available by clicking http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/Business/Divisions/Contracting/Acc_Announ.asp.  The solicitation number is W911W6-09-P-0026 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Under this effort, the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) intends to award a commercial firm fixed price contract with an anticipated award date of June 26, 2009.  The intended source is DP Technologies Corporation, 8535 Cliff Cameron Drive, Ste. 112, Charlotte, NC  28269.<BR><BR>The Government deems the required programming software to be available only from DP Technologies because the ESPRIT CAM has the unique qualifications to meet the software requirement to match and integrate software with existing machinery owned by the Government.  DP Technologies is deemed to be the only vendor that offers all the following features to match the needs of the machinery and manufacturing environment:  a wire edm module that contains proprietary  Charmilles CT Expert technology database included in the programming process, a ProEngineering native file reader that will import native ProEngineering solid models to include the ProEngineering feature tree; a library of proven post and model simulators for the exact Mazak machine models used in this facility; an integrated mill/turn application that will eliminate the need to cut and paste from different operations; feature recognition capability of different geometry (holes, bosses, slots, windows, ledges etc.); knowledge based machining technology to include speed and feed and material library;  the ability to simulate the entire machining environment within the software to verify that the finished program will machine a part correctly thereby reducing machining operations and improving accuracy in the prototype parts. The listed features allow  prototype parts to be programmed quicker and more accurately.    In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b), the Contracting Officer has determined that, in the circumstances of the anticipated contract action, only one source is reasonably available that meets ALL requirements of the CAM software application.  Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to DP Technologies Corporation.    This synopsis/ solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32.  The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and is incorporated by reference. Please review the provision carefully to ensure that you are submitting all required information with your proposal.  Also in accordance with the provision, all prospective offerors must be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration prior to award.  A description of the services offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with requirements, to include product literature and warranty as applicable, shall be submitted. Delivery of software is to be no later than 8 July 2009.  Offerors are advised to include a completed copy of FAR provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and CertificationsCommercial Items and DFARS Representations and Certifications 252.212-7000 with your offer unless representations and certifications are available electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 511210, Software Publishers.  The small business size standard is $25 million.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, the following evaluation criteria will apply to any proposals received:  1) Technical capability of the offeror to provide CAM software that satisfies all Government requirements to include ability to match and integrate with Charmilles wire EDM CT Expert technology database; ability to import native ProEngineering solid models to include the ProEngineering feature tree;  ability to substantiate that posts and model simulator features of the proposed software are proven for Mazak machines; integrated mill/turn application that will reduce the time and potential for inaccuracy from exercise of two separate operations.  Within the technical capability criteria, the Government will consider the extent to which the proposed software incorporates knowledge based machining technology and feature recognition capability.  The Offeror must state intent to comply with the Governments proposed statement of work (see http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/Business/Divisions/Contracting/Acc_Announ.aspor provide exceptions and rationale for any exception. 2) compliance with stated delivery date; and 3) Price.  Technical capability and Schedule compliance when combined are of substantially greater importance than price  FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders Commercial Items are incorporated by reference. The following additional clauses apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.247-34, F.O.B. Destination; 52.252-2, Clauses Incorporated by Reference; DFARS 252.246-7000, Material Inspection and Receiving Report; 252.212-7001, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items; 252.225-7013 Duty Free.

As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are used as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been identified as the only products that will meet the Departments requirements as part of the Departments storage environment.<BR><BR>

<CONTACT>Cynthia Hische, 609-485-6288

<a href="mailto:cynthia.hische@faa.gov">cynthia.hische@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The FAA has a requirement to obtain support to the FAA in conducting safety risk research on safety of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS).
It is proposed to award a five year contract (one year with four option years) to FJLeonelli Group of Waxhaw, North Carolina.  FJLeonelli Group is the only known source who has the expertise and the background to perform this requirement.  
Purpose of Announcement: In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform the industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected source via single source procedures.  
This announcement is for informational purposes only.  It is not a Solicitation or Request for Proposal.  A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.
Safe integration of unmanned aircraft system (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS) poses greater technical challenges not only to the FAA but also the aviation industry.  UAS utilizes the most advaced technologies to achieve certain operational capabilities far exceeding the expectations of current NAS users.  These unique capabilities have demonstrated its potential of commercial applications as well as exceeding the expectations of current NAS users.  Data from the recently completed UAS technology survey sponsored by the FAA shows that integrating UAS in the NAS will potentially affect the entire NAS due to the various sizes of UAS (less than a foot up to the size of a commercial jet), wide ranges of maximum take-off weight (less than a pound to the weight of a large jet), large performance disparities in reference to the existing certificated aircraft and capabilities of operating in all classes of airspace (even the ones weighing less than 100 pounds are operating in Class A airspace).
In 2004, under the FAA request, the RTCA established a special committee 203 (SC203)to develop minimum aviation system perfomance standards for UAS, UAS Sense and Avoid Systems and UAS Command, Control and Communication Systems (C3).  Since then, the RTCA SC203 has been leading the effort of developing industry consensus standards for UAS SAA and C3, which are key and probably the most technically challenging issues for UAS to operate in the NAS.  These RTCA SC203 efforts, with active industry participation, are supported by the FAA, DOD and other Government agencies.  However, although UAS SAA and C3 standards are necessary to meet certain mandatory requirements as defined in the FAA regulations (14 CFR) but other regulatory requirements providing the minimum standards for the NAS safety must be met as well.  To consider these NAS safety requirements for UAS demands a thorough understanding of the FAA regulatory framework, its construct, its subchapters and their interrelations/interdependencies as well as their safety implications and demonstrated compliance requirements.Therefore, to meet the FAA goal of safe integration of UAS in the NAS, i.e., "DO NO HARM" and "NO ADVERSE IMPACT TO EXISTING NAS USERS", a systematic approach with basis of the FAA regulatory framework is needed to conduct research in suport of the development of UAS airworthiness standards, devise operational requirements, establish maintenance procedures, and conduct safety oversight activities.  Such a systematic approach will also support the FAA efforts in Next Gen implementation by studying safety implications of new aircraft technology to the NAS and supporting the development of new regulatory standards while implementing these new technologies.The Flight Safety Team is responsible for the FAA Unmanned Aircraft System Research program under the FAA Research , Engineering and Development Appropriation.  Under the program, UAS safety risk management is a high priority requirement.  It applies the principle of Safety Management System (SMS) Doctrine, FAA Order VS8000.1 issued by the FAA Office of Aviation Safety (AVS) to develop regulatory bassed metholologies to assess UAS risks and their mitigations while operating in the NAS and interacting with other users. Although, the SMS is mandated by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) only in three areas:  Annex 6 - Operation of Aircraft, Annex 11 - Air Traffic Services and Annex 14 - Aerodrome, the AVSSMS and expanded the SMS principle to its regulations in aircraft and airmen by requiring each of its "services/offices to develop and implement a plan for its funcitons under the AVSSMS, including, where appropriate, the structure of its safety oversight relationship with the segment of industry for which it holds safety oversight responsibility".  The regulatory-based SMS research directly supports this AVS mandate.There are many entities conducting UAS safety risk analysis related research.  However, they all, including the RTCA SC203 led effort, limit their efforts on UAS operational issues and/or particular operational scenarios with specific UAS.  The systemic and regulatory based SMS approach has not been adopted and applied.

<SUBJECT>Research and Development Sources Sought for the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) Renewal
<SOLNBR>SS-NHLBI-HV-09-23
<RESPDATE>070609
<CONTACT>Jeffrey A Williams, Phone (301) 435-0338, Fax (301) 480-3338, Email williamsja2@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC>This Research and Development (R & D) Sources Sought notice which was originally posted on June 17, 2009 has been revised in its entirety and replaced with the following language: 

This is a Research and Development (R & D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R & D requirement.  Small Businesses are encouraged to respond.

Background
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health is interested in renewing the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) registry contract for a data coordinating center to manage a registry of advanced heart failure patients receiving FDA-approved, durable, mechanical circulatory support devices (MCSDs).  INTERMACS is a national registry created to advance the understanding and application of mechanical circulatory support in order to improve the mortality, morbidity, and quality of life of patients with advanced heart failure.  It is a collaboration among NHLBI, FDA, CMS, clinicians, scientists, and industry.   To date there are 96 centers participating and over 1700 patients enrolled in the registry. 
 
As many as 600,000 patients in the US have advanced heart failure, and the numbers are growing.  Therapeutic approaches have changed little over the last few years and include: drugs, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and pacemakers.  Patients whose heart failure progresses to later stages of heart failure have options limited to medical management, transplantation or mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) therapy.  INTERMACS data serve to facilitate the refinement of patient selection to enhance clinical management with current devices, establish best clinical practices, expedite new clinical trials, improve economic outcomes, evaluate function and quality of life, guide new generation of device development, and promote research into heart failure and recovery..  

Purpose and Objectives
The goal of the proposed program is to continue and expand data collection of advanced heart failure patients receiving mechanical circulatory support devices (MCSD) collected through the existing Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS).  This will provide detailed data on advanced heart failure patients treated with FDA-approved, durable MCSD devices throughout the United States.  
All patients receiving MCSDs at INTERMACS certified sites are entered into the registry database.  Information on patient demographics, clinical and laboratory parameters, outcome measures, hospital and device performance, as well as blood and tissue samples are collected and stored.  The program is supported by an INTERMACS Data Coordinating Center.
 
Project Requirements
1.	Develop and implement a business plan that integrates non-federal government support for the INTERMACS enterprise on an increasing scale so that at the end of five years the NHLBI contribution to maintain the registry would be significantly reduced. 
2.	Maintain and support the existing Steering Committee structure and function including: representation from the NHLBI Project Office, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a study chair designated by the NHLBI, the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) Principal Investigator, Co-investigators, and members from representative participating hospitals; and the current and future Subcommittees and their activities.
3.	Provide travel arrangements for meetings to be held at least twice per year.  And prepare and distribute minutes of these meeting.
4.	Maintain and support certification and monitoring of hospital performance. 
5.	Maintain and support regulatory requirements for patient privacy and good clinical practices.  
6.	Serve as the repository for clinical data and provide oversight for the collection and processing of blood and/or tissue specimens. 
7.	Provide statistical analysis of the data.
8.	Prepare and distribute quarterly reports for participating hospitals to include patient recruitment in various categories, status of follow-up data, data compliance, and among other data.
9.	Provide both standard and specialized quarterly data reports to the Federal partners (FDA, CMS and NHLBI).
10.	Provide quarterly individualized industry data reports to collaborating companies.
11.	Provide a semiannual and annual summary report of the Registry to the NHLBI.
12.	Coordinate and support meetings and conference calls and prepare and distribute minutes of the meetings.
13.	Plan and conduct an annual conference for Registry collaborators and other interested investigators to present and review MCSD registry data.
14.	Prepare interim limited access data sets, consistent with NHLBI policies. And provide interim data sets to NHLBI approved investigators.
15.	Provide a final consolidated copy of patient data in hard copy and computerized disc formats, along with the supporting documents.
16.	Perform site visits with record audits to determine the accuracy of web-based data submitted and information contained in source documents.  Develop a plan for monitoring of INTERMACS hospitals over the 5 year course of the contract.
17.	Work with participating hospitals and investigators to prepare for publication abstracts and manuscripts resulting from the Registry.
18.	Develop and implement a plan for extending research collaborations beyond the current INTERMACS investigators.
19.	Develop and implement a plan to expand the pediatric component of INTERMACS in collaboration with outside organizations and other NIH programs. 
20.	Develop and execute procedures to make INTERMACS data collection software and associated documentation transportable for future government use. 
21.	Provide a detailed plan with cost estimates for identifying, contacting, and re-consenting existing INTERMACS patients.  The plan shall include regulatory support costs both at the DCC and sites, site coordinator time, and documentation of the process.
22.	Conduct registry data collection for a sub-study of prospective ambulatory heart failure patients followed on optimal medical therapy for whom chronic heart failure limits both function and survival to a range where elective implantation of LVADs should offer meaningful benefit.

Anticipated Period of Performance
A cost reimbursement contract is anticipated with an award date on or about May 31, 2010 and a period of performance for five years.

Individual features (barracks, dormitories, administrative facilities, and fire/police stations) do not have to be within a single project scope; however, projects that contain several or all features may be given more favorable consideration than projects that contain only individual features.  Also, base development projects designed and constructed in environments similar to Guam (remoteness, corrosiveness, etc.) will be considered more favorably.  List a maximum of ten (10) relevant projects completed in the past ten (10) years which best describe experience in design of base development projects discussed above.  A project or contract is defined as either a stand-alone contract or a single task order, or an accumulation of related task orders under the same Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract having the features described above.
3.  Selection criteria 2, paragraph a, is changed to read:
"Active U.S. professional registration or equivalent qualifications.  Note:  During contract execution, U.S. registration will be required for all engineers who approve designs."
4.  The order of importance for Selection criteria 5 through 7 is revised as follows:

b.  Selection criteria 6, Sustainable Design, is moved to Selection criteria 5.
c.  Selection criteria 7, Quality Control Program, is moved to Selection criteria 6.

Identify examples indicating design team (including consultants) experience and concepts employed, LEED certification points anticipated and final LEED points awarded, and LEED certified professionals proposed for this contract.
6.  Selection criteria 7, paragraph a, Past performance in utilization of small business concerns, is deleted in its entirety.
7.  The response due date is extended to 2:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on July 1, 2009.

<DESC>RECOVERY--SOURCES SOUGHT:  Announcement of Intent to Award Sole-Source Remedial Action Services to Sevenson Environmental Services, Inc., for the Cornell Dubilier Electronics, Inc., Superfund Site, South Plainfield, Middlesex County, New Jersey<BR><BR>This is a Sources Sought announcement with the intent to award a sole-source contract to Sevenson Environmental Services, Inc., under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Part 6.302.  In providing support for the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District intends to issue a sole source, site specific contract for completing the remedial action associated with Operable Unit 2 (OU2) of the Cornell Dubilier Electronics, Inc. (CDE) Superfund Site (the Site).  The original task order for work at the Site was competed among four firms on the Pre-placed remedial action contract (PRAC), which is a small business set-aside, multiple award task order contract.  The four firms under the PRAC were selected through a formal competitive procurement process.<BR><BR>Award of the OU2 CDE work was made by Kansas City District to Sevenson Environmental Services, Inc., under contract W912DQ-04-D-0023, Task Order 0011.  Work under OU2 consists of completing a CERCLA remedial action involving the excavation and subsequent onsite treatment of contaminated soils through low temperature thermal desorption (LTTD) technology in accordance with the Record of Decision and the Remedial Design for the Site.  Work awarded to date under W912DQ-04-D-0023, Task Order 0011 consists of work plan preparation, subcontractor consent package preparation and approvals, air permitting activities for the LTTD unit, soil erosion and sediment control certification activities, wastewater discharge permitting activities, mobilization and maintenance of temporary facilities, mobilization of an LTTD unit, securing utility clearances and utility connections, characterization sampling and waste profiling, excavation of soils, and other general conditions associated with Site remediation.  Due to overall capacity shortfalls on contract W912DQ-04-D-0023, the Kansas City District intends to issue a sole source, site-specific contract for logical follow-on work in order to complete the remedial action associated with contaminated soils and site restoration activities for OU2.<BR><BR>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the work and services described herein is 562910.  Requirements for this remedy include excavation of contaminated soil containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at concentrations greater than 500 mg/kg and contaminated soils that exceed New Jersey's impact to Groundwater Soil Cleanup Criteria (IGWSCC) for contaminants other than PCBs.  Onsite treatment of excavated soil amenable to treatment LTTD technology is required.  Excavated areas are to be backfilled with treated soils and supplemented as necessary with clean backfill.  Contaminated soils and debris not suitable for on-site LTTD treatment will be transported offsite for disposal, and where necessary treated offsite prior to disposal.  Site restoration includes installation of a multi-layer cap or hardscape, installation of engineering controls and other property restoration activities.  Attached to this Source Sought are the plans and specifications that fully describe the projects requirements.<BR><BR>A critical component of the project is the contractor furnished and operated LTTD unit.  The LTTD unit will be equipped with desorption chambers, an air pollution control system, a control room, a material handling system and all necessary incidentals required for a complete temporary onsite treatment system.  The LTTD unit requires a nominal throughput capacity of 18 tons per hour.  The remedy does not allow for an incinerator or direct-fired system.<BR><BR>The Government is currently in the process of gaining local and state regulatory permit equivalencies and approvals required to execute the work. This includes an NJDEP Air Quality Permit Equivalency, in accordance with NJAC 7:27-8.  The Governments current contractor will have an NJDEP Air Quality Permit Equivalency approved by the State on or before September 2009.  The Government is also pursuing a soil erosion and sediment control plan certification in accordance with the requirements of the Freehold Soil Conservation District, and an indirect discharge permit equivalency with the Middlesex County Utilities Authority to discharge pretreated wastewater into the local POTW (Publically Owned Treatment Works).<BR><BR>Subcontractor procurement has been completed for the air permit equivalency, mobilization of the LTTD unit to the Site, system performance testing, and full-scale Operation and Maintenance (O&M), land surveying services, analytical laboratory services, asphalt paving services, aggregate and backfill material supplier, electrical services, plumbing services, site security services, perimeter air monitoring services, and site office trailers and temporary material handling structures.  The following workplans have been completed and approved, or are in the process of being approved:  Site Health and Safety Plan, Air Monitoring Plan, Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan, Sampling and Analysis Plan, Contractor Quality Control Plan, Site Security Plan, Temporary Site facilities Layout Plan, Excavation and Material Handling Plan, Waste Management Plan, Lead Compliance Plan, Housekeeping Plan, and Quality of Life Engineering Plan. <BR><BR>With regard to scheduling with the incumbent contractor:  The Government intends to complete the LTTD unit mobilization on or before October 2009.  Completion of the LTTD system performance testing will be achieved by October 2009, with full-scale system Operation and Maintenance from October 2009 to January 2011.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) to award a contract for the Plattsburgh Harbor Breakwater Repairs project. The work involves placement of approximately 12,690 tons of Armor stone (4.5 9 tons each) and 9,210 tons of underlayer/bedding stone to raise the breakwater to its original design elevation. The breakwater is located approximately one-half mile offshore necessitating that the repair/placement work be performed using floating plant. All work must be completed by November 2009 due to adverse weather conditions in Lake Champlain.<br /><br />This procurement is being solicited as a 100% SMALL BUSINESS set-aside. The applicable NAICS Code is 237990. The Small Business size is $33,500,000. The SIC Code is 1629, Heavy Construction, Not Elsewhere Classified. The range of the estimated construction cost is $2,000,000.00 to $2,500,000.00. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires that Past Performance Information (PPI) be collected on Department of Defense (DoD) contracts. The Government has now implemented a web-enabled application that collects and manages contractor past performance data. Effective 1 April 2007, the system, Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), requires both the contractor and the Government to submit their portion of the CPARS report via the internet for Construction contracts in excess of $100,000.00. More definitive guidance and instructions will be incorporated in the solicitation and resultant contract. In the meantime, to become familiar with the system, the CPARS website has a computer-based training module and a practice session for your use at https://www.nwp.usace.army.mil/ct/I/home.asp by following the links to the Training. Plans and Specifications for the subject project will be available on or about 27 MAY 2009 with bid opening on or about 29 JUNE 2009. Bids are to be submitted to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Contracting Division, Room 1843, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, NY 10278.

<DESC><p>AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT PROPOSAL CALL 0018</p>
<p>Recovery Act Near Term Energy-Efficient Technology Demonstrations and Research</p>
<p>This contract action was accomplished using competitive procedures.</p>
<p>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price contract type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded. (FAR 16.301-2)</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.403-1(c)(1), adequate price competition existed.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: This award will demonstrate high efficiency solar cells for space and near space applications. These solar cells will respond to the space solar spectrum, converting solar energy to useable electrical power for DOD and commercial satellites. The technology being developed also has applicability to use in concentrator systems for terrestrial power generation. Tasks will focus on development and optimization of the materials and processes to fabricate these solar cells. The effort includes engineering confidence testing to ensure that the solar cells developed can survive the harsh space environment.</p>

<AWARDEE>ENERGX TN, LLC, 667 Emory Valley Rd.
Suite A, Oak Ridge, TN 37830-6898 US
<DESC>Contract DE-AC05-98OR22516 is a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Contract for the operation and management of the Transuranic Waste Processing Center (TWPC) at Lenoir City, TN, to enable the processing of Transuranic (TRU) and low-level waste for disposal.  This contract is receiving ARRA funding in the amount of $9.4 million dollars for the acceleration of the processing of remote handled (RH) and contact-handled (CH) TRU waste on the Oak Ridge Reservation, so that the waste can be characterized and shipped to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant or other disposal facilities for disposition approximately one year earlier than planned.


Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:

The new funding merely accelerates the schedule for the TWPC under the current CPIF contract, which originally had been competed.  The very nature of the work requires some flexibility to accomplish; therefore, it would not be feasible to award this accelerated effort as fixed-price.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION 
Brand Name Justification
Recovery Act Funding

 
1.  	The Office of Acquisition Management is conducting this acquisition for Precise Biometrics’ Biometric and Smart Card Readers on behalf of Systems Integrity Division.  The estimated cost is $131,000.

2.  	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:
	Precise Biometric Enterprise License for 60,000 users in support of the Department of State’s Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) program.

3.  	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the Department’s needs.  The Department of State PKI program uses Precise Biometrics’ Precise 200MC hardware, which includes both smartcard and biometrics fingerprint readers.  Interoperability of the components is essential to a functional system; components not certified by Precise may prove non-functional in this configuration.  The enterprise license is a maintenance and level III support for the biometric readers.  The estimated dollar value of this procurement is $131,000.

4.  	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  IRM/OPS/ITI/SI requires Precise 200MC readers and the enterprise license is to be in place for maintenance and support of this equipment.  This requirement for the enterprise license is only through the manufacturer, Precise Biometrics; therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(l), only one reasonable source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(c) Application for Brand Name Description, is cited at the statutory authority.

5.  	A demonstration that the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.   
•	The Department has multiple technical requirements for its deployment of Smart Card Readers.  Only Precise biometric readers meet all Department requirements. The license is proprietary from the manufacturer, Precise Biometrics and will provide the maintenance on the existing licenses for this product that is already in use and on the Department of State network.  The cost would be significant to the Government to implement another brand of reader on the DoS network.  Additional cost would be incurred for the readers and the license.  This requirement is to cover the Enterprise License (60,000 users) as well as maintenance and level III support.  This is an annual fee that is paid to the manufacturer, Precise Biometrics.

The following are identified as requirements that cannot be met by another brand to date:

•	All processing of the biometric is handled within the reader device and smart card in what is termed Match on Card (MOC) technology.  No images or biometric information can pass between the reader and a PC, occur on the PC, be validated across the network.  This is a critical component to protect personally identifiable information (PII).  Without this protection, an additional layer of security would have to be architected into the device to ensure that biometric PKI was not exposed.
•	Because the Precise model readers incorporate biometric readers, coupled with smart card readers, the Department meets the two-factor authentication requirement.  This is a major security component that can only be ensured through the use of both biometrics and possession of the smart card token which Precise Biometrics provides.
•	The processes to support MOC technology are proprietary.  Hence, future upgrades of firmware and software would not be able to be duplicated by another vendor.
•	Management of multiple reader platforms will create significant and costly configuration management issues for the Department.  Given the requirements in managing one manufacturer’s platform across the enterprise, coupled with deploying the required software, to include updates and patches, multiple platforms would create serious logistics problems for the Department.  It would require that multiple software drivers be pushed to all Department PCs, which would potentially create software incompatibilities on those PCs.  Because the devices would be incompatible, posts would be required to keep more spare readers on hand than with one device, simply because of that incompatibility which would be more costly for the Government.  This would ultimately cost the Department more in maintenance than having to only maintain one platform.  
•	The Precise model readers are the only devices that are compatible with SafeNet BSec Middleware, which is currently deployed within the Department, and is a critical component to meeting security requirements.  Moving away from this standard would create multiple incompatible configurations on computer systems that would be driven by which reader was available for installation.  This has the potential to drive cost, security and logistics issues.  The cost factor for the Government would be minimal in using the Precise Biometric readers that is compatible with the systems already in place for all of Department of State and the posts worldwide.
•	The Precise model readers perform both biometric enrollment and verification of users.  This flexibility ensures that only one reader need be deployed on users’ desks for both system requirements. 
•	Various readers respond differently to the placement of fingers when the biometric is read.  Use of multiple readers within the Department would affect the logon process for some readers, as finger placement can make it very difficult for some users to logon.  As the readers will be required to logon to OpenNet, this will prove to be frustrating should users not be able to easily and consistently logon with the same level of confidence.
•	The Precise biometric reader is the only reader currently on the GSA HSPD-12 approved products list, which is both HSPD-12 compliant, and supports our legacy installation. 

6. 	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.  This requirement will be sole sourced to Precise Biometrics and the award publicized on FedBizOps.  Market research was done through GSA Advantage to verify that the license is procured directly from the manufacturer, Precise Biometrics. 

7.  	A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  
	A quote for the enterprise license was received and has been determined to be fair and reasonable for providing support for the 60,000 users.
	
8.  	A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.  
	Precise is the manufacturer and only provider that can upgrade, update, patch and replace defective readers with identical technical specification to those currently installed, Precise Biometrics is the sole source.  Precise Biometrics as the manufacturer provides the maintenance and support for the equipment through the enterprise license.

9.  	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.  
	The award as a sole source will be publicized on FedBidOps.  No other source is available for this requirement and the enterprise license is being procured directly from the manufacturer.

10.  	A listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the   acquisition.   Sole Source to the manufacturer, Precise Biometrics

11.  	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.
	PKI/BLADE is a COTS solution that provides PKI functionality and biometric authentication to the OpenNet.  Even though it is a COTS solution, it is also a proprietary solution and the enterprise license for the maintenance and support must be procured through the manufacturer.  Should a wider variety of digital encryption services and products become known to IRM/SI, these products will be considered as potential sources.

<AWARDEE>Eastern Research Group, Inc., 110 Hartwell Avenue, Suite 1, Lexington, MA 02421 US
<DESC>RECOVERY:  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  

The U.S. Department of Labor has awarded a time-and-materials type task order against existing IDIQ contract DOLJ099F28441 -- Development and Implementation of Log Data Collection and Analysis to Support Targeting of OSHA’s Interventions. 

Determination and Findings for Use of Other than Firm-Fixed Price Contracts:

Upon the basis of the following findings and determination that I hereby make pursuant to the authority of FAR Subpart 16.6, the proposed task order described below may be entered into on a time and materials type basis.

Description of the agency requirement:

This task order is for a Contractor to support the expansion of the annual data collection to include the collection of work-related injury and illness data from approximately 20,000 establishments in the construction industry.  The Contractor will serve as the data collecting agent for all construction industry establishments and will modify the existing software, as needed, to interface with other data sources; and assist OSHA in operating the system and executing activities that are essential for the successful completion of the data collection.  

The Contractor will also make the data available to the Agency for use on a real-time basis (i.e. the Agency will be able to access and use the data as it is collected).  The contractor will assist the Agency in maintaining its recordkeeping program for employers in the construction industry and will provide ongoing support and outreach to assist OSA in meeting the programmatic needs. The activities during the contract will include the collection and finalization of the CY 2008 construction data, conduct the analysis of the data collected, and provide support for data quality improvement.  

Findings

1.  The proposed procurement calls for annual data collection to collect work-related injury and illness data for the construction industry, as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in support of Log Data Collection and Analysis to Support the Targeting of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, to be funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  
2.  FAR Subpart 16.6 indicates that a time and materials type contract is appropriate only when “it is not possible at the time of placing the contract to estimate the extent or duration of the work, or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.”  At the time of award, neither the Program Office nor the Contracting Officer was able to determine the amount of support required with any reasonable degree of confidence.  
3.  This task order is being placed against existing, competitively awarded, time and materials type IDIQ contract DOLJ099F28441.  

Determination

1.  In accordance with FAR 16.301-3(b), this is not a cost-reimbursement contract for the acquisition of commercial items.
2.  It is impracticable to secure services of the kind or quality required, without the use of the proposed contract type. 
3.  The estimated cost of the proposed task order is $600,000.00, which includes labor hours and other direct costs from May 29, 2009, through March 31, 2010.

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<BR>Using Recovery Act funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a task order to contract number W91278-07-D-0111, a competitively awarded Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract for Cultural Resources Services for the Mobile District, awarded to Brockington and Associates, 6611 Bay Circle Suite 220, Norcross, Georgia 30071-1225.   This task order will be for Cultural Resources Investigations for Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) River Basin Water Control Manual and EIS, for Alabama, Florida and Georgia.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the task order will be to comply with appropriate cultural resources laws and regulations, and the management and protection of historic properties within the basin.<BR> <BR>The objective of the cultural resources investigations is to comply with statutory laws and regulations that govern Federal responsibilities concerning management and protection of historic properties.  Current work associated with completion of Water Control Manual and EIS for the ACF is to present data that will complete a study of cultural resources of the river basin that includes an inventory of sites along the waterway; a review of regional histories, archeological surveys, and historic properties management plans (HPMPs); and GIS data and update of predictive model on effects of water allocation as satisfaction of regulatory requirements including but not limited to those in the National Historic Preservation Act and 36CFR800 (Protection of Historic Properties).  The results of this study will be incorporated into the EIS and Water Control Manual and will be used to evaluate the potential impacts and effects to cultural resources in the ACF basin.  In the past the evaluations of impacts have focused on three potential effects from changes in water level management: erosion, deposition of sediment, and access.  The studies resulting from this contract will be coordinated with the appropriate SHPO, Tribal representatives and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation by the Government.<BR><BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) The  work to be performed is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions.  2) The incumbent contractor has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost.  3)  They have provided a predictive model for archaeological site information for the original water allocation study within the basin based on the contractors familiarity with the project.  4) This contract enables the work to begin immediately.<BR><BR>The American  Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and  to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current IDIQ contract to meet its requirements.   This contract was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  <BR>

<DESC><p>HQ AFRC/A7KA intends to issue a sole-source procurement action to the incumbent contractor Blaine Warren Advertising to extend the period of performance of the current contract by one year for the AFRC Advertising Contract. This action is required to maintain operations until a new contract is awarded. This will allow the Government sufficient time to award a new contract for these services and get a new source selection team in place. This is being conducted using procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-2. All parties with questions or concerns must contact the Contracting Officer, Brenda Pate at brenda.pate@afrc.af.mil (478)327-0815.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs VA Caribbean Healthcare System (VACHS) San Juan, Puerto Rico has awarded Contract No. VA-248-P-1033 for the services of Bathroom Deodorizing at VACHS for a period of six (6) months.  Below is the approved Justification and Authorization for use of Other than Full and Open Competition.

DEPARTMENT OF 						MEMORANDUMVETERANS AFFAIRS

Date:  March 25, 2009									
From:	Contract Specialist (672/PBD)
Subj:	JUSTIFICATION AND AUTHORIZATION FOR THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION; BATHROOM DEODORIZING SERVICES.
To:	File
1. AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: Department of Veterans Affairs, Procurement Business Division, Tres Ros Building, San Patricio, 27 Ave. J. Gonzlez Guisti, Suite 600, Guaynabo, PR, 00968. 	
2. DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:  This is an urgent contract action which includes providing the installation, calibration and maintenance of the Bathroom Deodorizing Services at the VA Caribbean Healthcare System at San Juan, Puerto Rico.  It has been classified as urgent because of a delay on past performance replies from Disabled Veterans Contractors under this NAICS code.  It will be done from April 1, 2009 to September 30, 2009.  Full and open competition will follow for future term (s) on this contract.   
3.  DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: The Department of Veterans Affairs VA Caribbean Healthcare System seeks a Contractor that can provide all labor, supervision, materials, equipment and repair parts to one hundred five (105) drip units; already installed.  This Contractor shall also execute deodorizing services for the toilets, and/or urinals for bathrooms at the VA Caribbean Healthcare System.   
4.  AUTHORITY CITED: FAR 6.302-2 (b) (2). Due to a delay resulted from several unforeseen situations an unusual and compelling urgency to comply with environmental regulations and to satisfy agency requirements.  Full and open competition will follow after Fedbizopps publishing.   
5.  REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED:  Due to a delay resulted from several unforeseen situations and unusual and compelling urgency to comply with environmental regulations and to satisfy agency requirements, it was agreed to continue until September 30, 2009 with the former Contractor, Warco Group.  It is more advantageous to the Government that WARCO gives their services for the following reasons:    a)  After an exhaustive market research with three service disabled contractors under such NAICS code, it was revealed, when past performance was requested, that companies did not guarantee a successful program as per scope of work requirements.  In addition to that, two of the companies listed are the same company (GIRE).
b)  WARCO Group has been servicing the VACHS for the past five years, and they can follow up with the services until a new solicitation package will be published as a full and open competition for small businesses.  Hopefully, we will find one that fulfill one of the socioeconomic goals, as required, and that complies with all VACHS requirements; as well.
c)  WARCO is the service provider that can provide a continuous monitoring and operating system for those drips units already installed.
d) This Company (WARCO Group) has the expertise to comply with requirements and specified calibration required, since they had been doing it for the past five (5) years with an extraordinary past performance and prompt response.
Due to the above reasons, WARCO Group is the feasible source that can meet mission needs at this moment to provide the VA Caribbean Healthcare System saving money and administrative costs.
6.  EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: First stage of Market Research with the Disabled Veterans Owned Companies.  None of the listed Disabled Veterans Owned contractor was found that can satisfy the VACHS requirements when past performance was requested. See paragraph 5 for additional justification.  In addition to that, please refer to file for copies of past performance requested to those companies.
7.  FAIR AND REASONABLE PRICE DETERMINATION:  Estimated cost is $4567.50.  Estimated cost is based on $761.25 charge per month.  The contract will be for six (6) months only.
8.  MARKET RESEARCH: A market survey was conducted for this action since 4 records were found for this NAICS code 561720 certified as Service Disabled Veteran Owned.  A written performance past evaluation was requested from each of them and only two replied.  After evaluation by the COTR taking into consideration the scope of work and service needs it was concluded that none of the two companies had done the described work before. At this moment the only contractor that we can refer and be sure their response will be a positive one is WARCO Group.
9.	OTHER FACTORS: None
10.	INTERESTED SOURCES: WARCO Group     P.O. Box 1868     Trujillo Alto, PR 00976                                            11.  ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION:  For the contract after September 30, 2009 a full an open competition will take place.
12. TECHNICAL CERTIFICATION: "I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief."
