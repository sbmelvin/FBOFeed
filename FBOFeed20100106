<DESC>52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes. This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 52.215-3 --   Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of  this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except  as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection  31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although “proposal” and “offeror” are used in this Request for  Information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall  not be used as a proposal. (c) Background:  The C-17 Training Systems Integrated Product Team at  Wright-Patterson AFB OH is responsible for the development, fielding and  sustainment of aircrew and maintenance training devices, concurrency of  those devices, and aircrew instruction.  The breadth of this effort  expands across eight USAF bases in CONUS, two in PACAF, and an Australian  FMS base.  The C-17 Aircrew Training System (ATS) is comprised of seven  different training devices of which, to date, 163 out of 179 devices have  been fielded.  The C-17 Maintenance Training System (MTS), on the other  hand, is comprised of ten different devices with 28 of 37 devices fielded.  Whereas ATS devices can be found at every C-17 base, only seven USAF bases  will eventually house the MTS devices. (d) The purpose of this RFI is to assist the program office with the  formulation of the acquisition strategy and to ascertain your interest in  bidding on a 10-year C-17 ATS/MTS Sustainment Re-Compete program.  This  program is comprised of three components; 1) ATS and MTS Contractor  Logistics Support (CLS), 2) ATS Instruction, and 3) ATS and MTS  Concurrency Management.  The offerors will be asked to bid on a combined  program encapsulating all of the components list above.  They will also be  given the opportunity to bid on an ATS-only piece  (CLS/Instruction/Concurrency) and/or an MTS-only piece (CLS/Concurrency). 1.  Describe your past experience for performing contractor logistics  support, instruction, and/or concurrency management to include: •	Program name •	Government or contractor POC •	Description of the effort; i.e., number of locations supported, number  of personnel assigned, etc. •	Date & period of performance •	Cost of effort •	Description of support strategy, i.e., guaranteed student, on-call,  modified on-call, etc. 2.	In an effort to instill contractual flexibility to react quickly to  budget fluctuations, we’re looking for ways to implement a “throttle”  mechanism.  By this we want the capability to surge as well a scale back  on the CLS effort.  What ideas might you have to accomplish this and have  you implemented it on a previous program? 3.  What innovative ways have you used in the past, or could possibly  envision to keep CLS costs down to include integrating the two systems  together? 4.  In carrying out this effort, what would be your reliance on government  personnel and what would be required of them? 5.  What data will you require of the government to assemble a proposal  for this effort? 6.  What risks do you foresee in performing this effort?  What steps would  you likely take to mitigate the risks? Contractors responding to this announcement should indicate their size,  particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically  disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business  concern, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Native  American-Owned Small Business, and should also indicate if the company is  foreign-owned.  Interested sources are encouraged to first register as a  source on the PIXS Web Site (www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil).  Interested sources  must respond with a complete Request for Information package of no more  than 10 pages though, providing everything requested above. All parties  are asked to provide a point of contact, a telephone number, an e-mail  address, and a facsimile number in their response. This information should be sent electronically to Mr Rick Fennell at  ricky.fennell@wpafb.af.mil.  Responses should be received no later than 15  March 2007.

<a href="mailto:troy.lower@conus.army.mil">ITEC4, NCR PARC (NCR-CC)</a>
<DESC>Performance Work Statement (PWS):<BR><BR>Title:  MHS BLOOD MANAGEMENT DONOR SERVICES<BR><BR>Requiring Activity Name:  DHIMS     <BR><BR><BR> <BR>1.0	SCOPE<BR>This award provides for the services, materials, and software needed to procure an enterprise-wide Blood Donor Management solution. This enterprise AIS (automated information system) solution will manage aspects of the blood donation process including blood donor screening, products and associated record keeping for military blood donors, their dependent donors and other civilian donors in the Continental United States (CONUS), Outside Continental United States (OCONUS), and  Theater. <BR><BR>1.0.1	Background<BR>Prior to the late 1990s, the DoD Blood Banks (donor centers and transfusion services) used manual processes to comply with required documentation. Patient and test data was transcribed by hand onto labels, logs and result forms; look backs required manual examination of blood transfusion and donor records; patient and donor records were retrieved manually; inventory counting was done manually which resulted in inconsistent availability of blood supplies, over collection and increased number of expired blood units.<BR><BR>In response to the need to automate blood management processes, the Military Health System (MHS) developed an automated information system (AIS) to support the Armed Services Blood Program  (ASBP), the Surgeons General and MHS personnel readiness. The current legacy system, the Defense Blood Standard System (DBSS), is designated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a Class II Medical Device (510K). DBSS v3.04 is the AIS currently maintained by the Defense Health Services Systems (DHSS) Program Office to manage donor and transfusion workflow. <BR><BR>Donor eligibility is determined via a standardized screening process as required by the FDA and the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB). The ASBP uses a paper form (Department of Defense Form 572, Blood Donation Record) to capture the donors health history. A sample of the form can be obtained on request to the Government Point of Contact (POC) listed in the Submission Procedures, below. The health history questionnaire serves as the first step in the collection process for protecting the blood supply and potential donor.<BR><BR>The DD Form 572 has been changed over the years due to the emergence of new diseases and more rigorous donor eligibility criteria. The length of the form has been expanded to its maximum capacity with the addition of new questions that need to be captured for the screening process. The goal is not to maintain the form but to obtain an automated donor interview and screening system that is FDA compliant and meets all current donor qualification standards.<BR><BR>A blood donor center staff member must review and interview the potential blood donor upon completion of the questionnaire. This increases the blood donor centers staff workload and poses a time constraint on the number of donors that can be processed during a given day. The goal is to process 100 donors over a one hour period.<BR><BR>The DoD Standard Form (SF) 518 is the blood product request form and patient transfusion record. The form is used to supplement the current blood management AIS, because the form has not been completely integrated into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and the hospital Electronic Health Record (EHR).<BR><BR>1.0.2	Objectives<BR>The Offeror shall provide an enterprise blood donor management system to include the ability to support the full spectrum of donor screening, registration functions and all blood manufacturing functions (to include but not limited to donor collection, component preparation, testing, labeling, shipping, reporting); share appropriate information between individual centers; create look back (i.e., blood product traceability) across all centers and MHS ; share information in standard formats to other MHS IT systems. <BR><BR>

Past Performance and Small Business Subcontracting are significantly more important than Price, however, as proposals become more equal in non-price factors, price becomes more important and may be a determining factor for award.</p>

Procurement history in IHS system shows that Bell Helicopter is the supplier of this item for the last 40 years. <br />However, surplus material with identical design can be purchased. Item from a surplus source must have documentation that states the original manufacturer, cage code, date of manufacturing, and a Certificate of Conformance. Surplus item purchase documentation must be reviewed and approved by Engineering.</p>

<p>Ship To:&nbsp; DO 35K Depot Supply, SW3119 DDWG-ER-DLA, Central Receiving, 455 Byron Street, Robins AFB,&nbsp;GA 31098&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />This item is part of the main transmission gearbox and is approximate 14 x 12 x 6 inches. It is made of cast alloy and has intricate design. The main transmission gearbox transfers the power from the engine output shaft to the main rotor drive shaft and the tail rotor shaft. The lower housing contains the oil sump and other components inside the gearbox. Since the transmission gearbox is the vital component of the rotor drive train, the housing is an important component of the helicopter. This housing has critical characteristics which if not conforming to the design of the part could cause failure of the part. Failure of this item can result in the loss of aircraft and possible loss of life.<br />The lower transmission housing, part number 204-040-355-5 is the only transmission housing authorized for use on the UH-1N and UH-1H/V helicopter.<br />&nbsp;</p>

A determination not to compete this proposed contract action issolely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested parties mayprovideevidence of their capability to accommodate this requirement and mustrespondby January 21, 2010, 4:00 PM Mountain Time.  Responses should be submittedtoMs. Leticia Potts, Contracting Officer, NNSA Service Center, Office ofBusinessServices, Field Acquisition Department, P.O.

<SUBJECT>Annual Support/Software Maintenance for the Avatier Identity Management Server (AIMS)
<SOLNBR>NCI-100038-AV
<RESPDATE>012110
<CONTACT>Ashley L. Virts, Email virtsa@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Biomedical Informatics & Information Technology (CBIIT) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Avatier Corporation, 12647 Alcosta Blvd., #140, San Ramon, CA  94583 for Annual Support and Software Maintenance for the Avatier Identity Management Server (AIMS) currently in place at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541511 and the business size standard is $25M.  

Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract.

The period of performance shall be twelve (12) months from date of award.

Since July of 2005, NCI has been using Avatier’s Password Station as the mechanism of synchronizing passwords between NIH’s Active Directory (AD) and NCI’s Novell Directory (eDir).  This synchronization of passwords has allowed for a seamless single sign-on solution for NCI Users.  This package has also allowed users to change/reset their passwords from a browser with access to the internet in a secure fashion.  The NCI Infrastructure must manage multiple accounts; specifically the NIH Active Directory Account and NCI’s Novell eDirectory Account.  These accounts are used by NCI staff to access a variety of services at the NIH to include Exchange Email, Windows and Novell File Servers, various websites that require user authentication, and ITAS.

The NCI Infrastructure Services determined that it was not practical for NCI users to attempt to manage two distinct accounts separately, but as one. Avatier is the only product on the market to provide this capability. In addition to the needs by the NCI User Community, CBIIT currently utilizes this mechanism to allow self service password reset to users external to NCI.  CBIIT maintains many public websites (applications) that require user authentication provided for by the AIMS platform.  The purpose of this requirement is to support the continued use of Password Station within NCI’s environment. Password Station is a software product that allows NCI to maintain self-service password management capabilities for those users that are external to NCI but require authenticated access to NCI systems. The contract will provide support for over 10,000 licenses; renewable annually.

Additionally, both Active Directory and eDirectory require “strong passwords”.  NCI has implemented Novell’s Universal Password policy within eDirectory.  Only Avatier’s product can handle the complexities between the Active Directory and eDirectory settings.  Other software can only read the native NDS/bindery password policy information which is not used within NCI’s environment. For these reasons, Avatier is uniquely qualified to provide the continued support and services of Password Station within the NCI infrastructure.

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on January 21, 2010.  No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax), an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Ashley Virts, Contract Specialist at virtsa@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Please reference solicitation number NCI-¬¬¬¬¬100038-AV on all correspondence.

<DESC>Description:

The U.S. Department of State (DoS) intends to conduct a competitive procurement for a contractor(s) to provide construction security monitoring services at overseas and domestic Department of State (DoS) construction sites and storage areas.  DoS requires Site Security Personnel (SSP) support services at various domestic and overseas facilities to detect unauthorized access to internal controlled areas, to deter the introduction of unauthorized materials to the site, and to surveil the activities of un-cleared construction workers to prevent the implantation of clandestine surveillance devices or systems into the structure being constructed or its surroundings.  Four types of SSP may be required: 1) Cleared American Guards (CAG), 2) Construction Surveillance Technicians (CST), 3) Team Leaders, and 4) Site Security Coordinators (SSC).  There is currently no known requirement for construction security monitoring services at any domestic locations.  However, if a domestic need for these services should arise, DoS may also acquire the necessary services under this contract through issuance of delivery/task orders, which will specify locations and will include any provision and/or instructions applicable to work within the United States.

DoS plans to award multiple Labor-Hour, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for base and (4) four one-year option years. The IDIQ awards will be made to the responsive offerors, whose proposals conform to the solicitation, and will offer the “Best Value” to the government, whereas technical factors are more important than cost.  One award will be set aside for small business should a small business be found capable.  To qualify as a small business under the NAICS code, 561612, the small business size is the average annual receipts of no more than $18.5M.

Offerors may obtain information on registration requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.  The Offeror is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data.

The Request for Solicitation and its attached documents will be posted under Solicitation Number, SAQMMA10R0022, on or around January 21, 2010.  Proposal submissions will be due 30 days after Solicitation posting on www.FEDBIZOPPS.gov.

Security Clearance Requirements:

Offerors must possess a Defense Security Service (DSS) Top Secret facility clearance (FCL), issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M.  All entities comprising a joint venture for this effort must already possess a TS FCL, as well as the joint venture.  Successful offerors shall assign only U.S. citizens who possess current final Top Secret personnel security clearances for performance as Site Security Personnel on this contract.  Certain domestic management personnel must possess DSS Secret personnel security clearances.

DOS will not sponsor any firm for a facility clearance or facility clearance upgrade from Secret to Top Secret for this solicitation due to time constraints.  Offerors must submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with the required qualification documentation.  A bidders DD Form 254 has been issued with this solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The US Geological Survey Biological Informatics Office (BIO), located in Reston Virginia and Denver Colorado, is seeking information and geospatial technologies support related to its implementation of the National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) Program.   The NBII serves as an electronic gateway to biological data and information products maintained by federal, state, and local government agencies; non-government institutions; and private sector organization in the United States and around the world.  Technical support is related to information technology development, database design and development, portal technologies, biodiversity data management, geospatial technologies design and development, representation of NBII technical capabilities and requirements within International biodiversity initiatives, and supporting project management requirements.   These areas are required to further the development and enhancements to the NBII over the next several years and support ongoing collaborations with other federal and non-federal organizations.   As the NBII has evolved over the past several years, these requirements for state-of-the-art on-site and off-site technical skills and support have been paramount to the implementation of the network.
The National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) Program was created in 1993 based on the recommendation of a special panel convened by the National Research Council to examine critical national biological resource issues.  The development of regional (focused on specific regional biodiversity data and information issues) and thematic nodes has been underway, in collaboration with partners from every sector of society, for the past three years.  A critical component to insuring the network is interoperable, operated in a cost effective manner, and proper technical leadership exists is to insure that the NBII Program Office, Biological Informatics Office has the adequate and high-skilled technology support to lead the implementation of the NBII.  The NBII Program Office and the USGS Center for Biological Informatics (CBI), located in Denver Colorado, are responsible for overall tool development, biodiversity data management policies and practices, technical leadership for cost-cutting NBII Node Working Groups (i.e. Information Technology, Geospatial Technologies), and representing the NBII on several International biodiversity technical initiatives.
Basic Requirement: 
The scope of this effort is very broad in terms of encompassing both information and geospatial technologies requirements, but also biological sciences expertise.    Furthermore, the scope also requires that support be provided to NBII domestic efforts along with international efforts.   Several objectives of this support are briefly described below.
Design, development, and implement state-of-the-art technical tools, databases, and applications that support the NBII Programs and collaborators (i.e. FRAMES) overall mission and objectives.
Continue to be seen as a technical leader within the bioinformatics domain by U.S. and several international organizations through development of standards, innovative tools/applications, and expertise.
Develop the various databases, web applications, geospatial tools, and other activities on-time, within scope, and meeting customer needs.

<DESC>General Information<BR>Northwest Region will initiate the standardization process for Stethoscopes for its seven Army, Navy, and Air Force medical facilities in Washington and Alaska.  The product line consists of various models and types of Stethoscopes.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize products or product lines obtaining the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price based on volume pricing discounts utilizing a best value determination process. Standardized products will be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. <BR><BR>The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the LSA-West region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the region are met and help identify possible candidates (i.e. like product items) for elimination, as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.<BR><BR>The Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the Region include but are not limited to:<BR>Bassett Army Community Hospital, Fort Wainwright, AK; Bremerton Naval Hospital, Bremerton, WA; Fairchild AFB Clinic, Fairchild AFB, WA; 354th Medical Group, Eielson Air Force Base, AK; 3rd Medical Group, Elmendorf AFB, AK; Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA; Oak Harbor Naval Hospital, Oak Harbor, WA.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PVs to distribute their items. This RFQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the PV Program. The RFQ will not result in a contract award. For additional information regarding DSCPs PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil. <BR>The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years. Anticipated selection date is 02/10.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR><BR>The Point of Contact is Rosa Crumpton, phone: 253-968-0898, and e-mail rosa.crumpton@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR> B. Products & Performance Required <BR><BR>The NorthWest Region is seeking Stethoscopes which at a minimum include the product lines below. Within the region, this product line has an estimated annual demand of $86,154. This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 12-month period. <BR>The top high volume usage lines for this project include: <BR>MANUF_NAME<BR>MANUF_<BR>PART_NUM<BR>SHORT_ITEM_DESC<BR><BR>3M<BR>3128<BR>STETHOSCOPE CARDIOLOGY III BLK<BR><BR>3M<BR>4100WS<BR>STETHOSCOPE LITTMANN ELECTRONIC 4100<BR><BR>3M<BR>2290<BR>STETHOSCOPE LITTMANN SELECT<BR><BR>3M<BR>2201<BR>STETHOSCOPE CLASSIC II SE BLCK<BR><BR>3M<BR>2203<BR>STETHOSCOPE CLASSIC II<BR><BR>MABIS<BR>75-458-010<BR>STETHOSCOPE DELUX SINGLE USE ADULT BLUE<BR><BR>3M<BR>3134<BR>STETHOSCOPE CARDIOLOGY III GRN<BR><BR>3M<BR>2165<BR>STETHOSCOPE MASTER CARDIOLOGY<BR><BR>3M<BR>2124<BR>STETHOSCOPE CLASSIC II INFANT<BR><BR>GRAHAM-FIELD HEALTH PRODUCTS<BR>400<BR>STETHOSCOPE DUAL HEAD BLACK<BR><BR><BR>At the request of the Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, PV order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor<BR>C. Instructions to Vendors <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to rosa.crumpton@amedd.army.mil.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM PST on the specified closing date of this RFQ. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Northwest Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR>D. Evaluation Criteria <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the NorthWest Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR>The TPRB intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the TPRB reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>Source Selection Procedures:<BR><BR>Pre-Source Selection Procedures:<BR><BR>1. The TRBO has used market research to confirm the availability of product groups which the Northwest Region DSL has selected for standardization. <BR>2. The MTFs in the Region volunteer and Clinical Product Team (CPT) members are selected for participation in the standardization process.  The 3 MTFs that will be participating in the clinical evaluation of this standardization initiative are Madigan Army Medical Center, WA; Naval Hospital Oak Harbor, WA; and Elmendorf Air Force Base Hospital, AK.<BR>3. The Clinical Product Team (CPT) develops, validates, and approves the technical/company and clinical/performance criteria and the evaluation process to be used.<BR>4. The CPT determined and approved that both literature and sample sets are required for the evaluation in a clinical setting. Requested samples will only include high-volume products. <BR>5. The Northwest Region Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) develops and submits the APP and Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) Request for Quotes through the DSL for review by Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP). <BR><BR>Source Selection Procedure:<BR><BR>1. This selection procedure is a one-step source selection process. The Northwest Region will post the RFQ to the FBO for a period of 14 calendar days. A letter (email) notice to the current vendors identified in the market share analysis above will be sent the same day the FBO is posted. The closing date and time will be the same, for the RFQ and for the email notification. <BR>2. Vendors will provide an initial response to the FBO posted RFQ by emailing their interest in participating in the standardization process to the point of contact (POC) listed on the FBO. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial response regarding their interest in participating in the standardization process, actually arrived at the Region via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendors that do not meet the deadline of close of business (COB) 4:00 pm (PST) Pacific Standard Time on the date listed for closing on the FBO RFQ, will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. <BR>3. The TRBO will request responses to the technical/company criteria, no charge literature, no charge sample set, and best value pricing from the vendor in a one-step source selection process. The one-step source selection process provides vendors with 21 calendar days to respond to the TRBO with the completed spreadsheet for both the Technical/Company criteria and the Vendors best value price quote; and deliver the no charge literature and no charge samples to the MTFs participating in the clinical evaluation process. The Technical/Company Criteria and Best Value Price Quote worksheets will be sent to the vendor via email and will include a due date. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions and criteria listed in the FBO announcement. Vendors that do not respond to the technical/company criteria will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. Literature and samples must be received by the participating MTFs by COB 4:00 PM PST, 21 days after the date of request to supply samples. All vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment.  The samples to be provided are as follows: The samples: 2 of each per MTF to be provided as follows:  Stethoscope Cardiac Dual Head Adult/Pediatric.<BR>4. Vendors that do not meet the deadline to deliver the literature and samples by the deadline or fail to send literature and samples to the MTFs will be disqualified from further consideration in this standardization initiative. Vendors best value pricing will be in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the total requirements of the Northwest Region. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submission/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off the Vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northwest Region). Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. However, the Region reserves the right to request revised quotes, if determined necessary. The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. Vendors that fail to submit price quotes will be disqualified from further consideration in this standardization initiative. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing by e-mail at the conclusion of the process.<BR>5. The TRBO team will compile the technical/company criteria responses and the results will be forwarded to the CPT. The technical and company criteria are weighted equally. The TRBO will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability. In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services, 2) the vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional more specific definition of technical acceptability. The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required. <BR>6. The CPT members will evaluate each vendors literature and sample set against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical setting. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The clinical/performance evaluation period will last up to 21 days. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert type scale with a 1-5 scoring range. The scale descriptors are: One (1) = Strongly Disagree; Two (2) = Disagree; Three (3) = Neutral; Four (4) = Agree; and Five (5) = Strongly Agree. The CPT will send the completed evaluations to the TRBO for data entry and analysis and the results will be forwarded to the TPRB for review. The CPT has set a clinical acceptability threshold target at 3.1.  The CPT will determine the actual acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative  at or near 3.1  depending on the location of any break (or gap) in vendors average scores.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold of 3.1, in determining the actual acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. <BR>7. The vendors will forward price quotes to the TRBO, the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis, and the results will be forwarded to the TPRB for review. The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines, (3) Potential Cost Avoidance (this is included as a reporting metric), and (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor. SKU review will assess the number of line items a vendor is able to supply to the MTFs versus the number of currently used line items. Cost avoidance is used as a reporting metric, not as an element of the decision. The DSL will ensure that the prices, with discounts off the DAPA prices will be a good value, in conjunction with the volume purchasing commitment, and the technical merit of the offer.<BR>8. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important. The Northwest Region TPRB will review the data to support a selection of the best value, lower overall cost quote. The TPRB will vote on a standardized vendor for Stethoscopes.  Each MTF on the TPRB is allotted one vote for the selection of the standardized vendor.  The votes are tallied and the vendor with the majority of votes is the selected standardized vendor.  A multiple award is a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region.<BR><BR>Technical/Company Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT developed, validated, and approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below.  The vendor must provide the information requested by each of the criteria.  A response of YES indicates that the company confirms that it can meet the criteria without exception.   A response of NO followed by an explanatory statement is permitted in order to explain any exceptions. <BR><BR>1. Vendors must provide a complete line of Stethoscopes for pediatric and adult patients.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  Stethoscope Products required by the region (at a minimum) are cardiac, infant, and dual headed stethoscopes.  NOTE:  Vendors:  Please state that you can provide a complete product line and a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.).  In addition, send any applicable product literature in response to this RFQ.<BR>2. Vendors must have a DAPA, or be in the process of applying for a DAPA, for the Stethoscope Product Line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>3. Vendors must have a separate agreement with the Regions Prime Vendor (currently, Cardinal Health is the PV for distribution in Region 11.)  Please provide documentation of your companys agreement with this Prime Vendor.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the Regional PV will be disqualified.)<BR>4. Vendors must offer volume discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Where FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA. Vendors that fail to offer a discount off the DAPA price will be disqualified<BR>5. Vendors must provide latex free products.<BR>6. Vendors must provide educational tools or materials for this product line.  Please list the tools available to staff and patients in response to this solicitation.<BR>7. Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for items in their Holding Chamber/Spacer product line, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  <BR>a. Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  <BR>b. Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.<BR>c. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.  Additionally, the Government will not contact any points of contact that are provided in response to this question.<BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT developed, validated, and approved the following equally weighted clinical/performance criteria.  <BR><BR>Criteria will be evaluated one time in a clinical setting by at least one clinical product team member at each participating facility.<BR>1. Patient Comfort  The chest piece has a non-chill rim.<BR>a. Provides patient comfort during the examination process.<BR>b.  Evaluator will apply the chest piece when examining the subject confirming the chest piece is not uncomfortably cold to the subject.<BR>2. Clinician Comfort  The headset is angled in an anatomically correct position providing an acceptable acoustic seal and comfortable fit.	<BR>a. Allows the clinician more time to complete a thorough examination.<BR>b. The evaluator will don the headset of the stethoscope observing the comfort of the headset.<BR>3. Clinician Preference - The chest piece is functional allowing grasping with multiple hand positions.<BR>a. It is important for the stethoscope chest piece to be constructed allowing the clinician to grasp the chest piece per his/her preference.<BR>b. The evaluator will hold the chest piece of the stethoscope determining its construction for multiple hand positions.<BR>4. Device Performance - The device remains highly effective in noisy environments. <BR>a. The clinicians environment during an examination is not always noise free.  It is important to have a stethoscope that can eliminate environment noise giving the clinician a quality examination.<BR>b. Evaluator will evaluate the device noting its function in a routine clinical setting.<BR>5. Device Performance - The diaphragm is of durable design & construction.<BR>a. Device will be used in a variety of settings in various MTFs and must be able to withstand normal use.<BR>b. Evaluator will determine whether device will maintain integrity during normal use in MTFs.<BR><BR>Post-Source Selection Procedures:  <BR><BR>1. The TRBO prepares the Decision Document for signature by the DSL and submits a package including the clinicians comments to DSCP for review and approval.  <BR>2. The RIA is initiated by the TRBO.  Vendors will be contacted and the TRBO will notify the TPRB, DSCP, PVM, and regional MTFs.<BR>3. If requested by a vendor, the TRBO will informally share information on the selection.  The Region will notify DSCP immediately in instances in which a vendor expresses substantial dissatisfaction with the evaluation.<BR>4. The selected vendor is given 15 calendar days to upload their RIA pricing to DSCP.<BR>5. The TRBO follows-up with the vendor and DSCP to insure pricing is loaded in the UDR. <BR>6. The TRBO assists the Regional MTFs in conversion implementation and reviews their compliance.<BR>7. The TRBO markets the clinically preferred product selection and cost avoidance benefits.<BR><BR>Rules of Engagement: <BR>a. Standardization Evaluations will be conducted in areas designated by the TRBO.<BR>b. Clinicians will use an evaluation tool, which will be collected by the TRBO.<BR>c. CPT members can have no invested personal interest in the outcome in a standardization effort. <BR>d. CPT members will be familiar with the specific guidelines for accepting gifts and incentive type items from vendors.  Any violations of the guidelines will be reported to the appropriate officials.  <BR>e. The TRBO will perform statistical analysis of data obtained from the evaluations.<BR>f. Vendors will deliver products to designated location and specified time as agreed upon by the vendors and the TRBO.<BR>g. Vendors presence will not be required during this evaluation.<BR>h. When participating in a standardization effort, vendors must contact the TRBO prior to contacting any clinical personnel in reference to the product being considered for standardization. <BR>i. Additional education or training on the selected products will be at the vendors expense. <BR>j. All evaluation methods will have a start and stop date set by the CPT that will be strictly enforced.  <BR>k. The government is not responsible for cost of sample items, shipping of these items, or any costs associated with the clinical evaluations.<BR>l. Only products selected by the CPT will be reviewed during an evaluation.  All other products presented during the evaluation will be rejected.<BR>m. Unless specifically requested by the TRBO, NO COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE SHOULD SPEAK TO ANY HOSPITAL STAFF MEMBER OR TPRB MEMBER REGARDING PRICE OR PRICE-RELATED FACTORS.<BR><BR>Failure to comply with any of the rules of engagement described above may result in disqualification of your company from further consideration.  Please do not hesitate to contact our Clinical Analyst at 253-968-0898 for questions.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice and it does not constitute a solicitation.  The U.S. Government is conducting a market survey of industry to identify sources that are interested in fulfilling the Afhanistan-Technical Equipment Maintenance Program (A-TEMP) which is a maintenance support requirement for the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) within Afghanistan.  The ANSF has an expanding fleet of equipment consisting of approximately 20,000-43,000 Afghanistan National Army (ANA) pieces of equipment which are maintained at 34 locations and approximately 15,000-27,000 Afghanistan National Police (ANP) pieces of equipment maintained at 18 locations.  The equipment is normally operated from fixed locations but, as operations dictate, the equipment maybe operated in austere and remote locations. Both equipment maintenance operations are well established and currently under government contract. The ANA and ANP equipment fleets will be maintained at separate facilities and under separate delivery orders.  The primary objective is to provide apprenticeship training, equipment maintenance and supply chain management support. Bilingual (Dari / English) capability to ensure smooth interaction with U.S. Government representatives at individual maintenance locations will be a contract requirement.

If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the April 2010 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.

Description

The USPS is considering potential sources for staffing the National Customer Support Center (NCSC) located in Memphis, TN.  

Background

The NCSC in Memphis, Tennessee develops products and services to assist the USPS and the mailing industry in fully and efficiently utilizing the USPS automation system of equipment and software.  NCSC’s mission is to support the USPS with a quality address database, a secure change of address system, addressing policies and programs, and customer address products in order to facilitate the timely and cost effective coding, sorting, and delivery of the mail.  Additionally, the USPS provides products and services to improve address quality and allow mailers to obtain discounts based on address quality.

The objective of this notice is to gather information from current sources that can meet the requirements specified herein.  This is a request for information only and is not a solicitation to purchase equipment or services.  The USPS may use information gathered through this announcement to pre-qualify multiple sources for the opportunity to submit a proposals for possible future solicitations.

Pre-qualification Process

Pre-qualification is a process whereby a supplier’s ability to meet specific USPS requirements is evaluated.  A purchase team will review and evaluate documentation submitted by interested suppliers in accordance with the evaluation factors listed in this announcement.  To receive credit for evaluation purposes, suppliers must meet all the requirements and submit adequate documentation.  Failure to address an item or submit the required documentation will reflect negatively in the evaluation scoring.

After the purchase team reviews and analyzes supplier responses based on information requested in this pre-qualification process, suppliers may be placed on the pre-qualified list.  All qualified suppliers may not be placed on the pre-qualified list if the purchase team decides (1) a smaller group will provide adequate competition, or (2) that some suppliers are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding opportunities for the less qualified.

During this process, each prospective supplier can be assured of the following:
1.	All suppliers will be treated fairly and objectively
2.	The inclusion or exclusion of a particular supplier will be based strictly on business reasons and will be judged solely on the predetermined pre-qualification criteria.
3.	A sufficient number of suppliers will be placed on the list to ensure adequate completion for subsequent purchases.
4.	Any sensitive business information provided by a supplier will be sufficiently protected from disclosure.

The pre-qualification process does not constitute an assurance that a subsequent Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued.  However, when, or if a RFP is issued, it will be provided to those suppliers on the pre-qualification list.  Should an RFP be issued, it may or may not result in an award, and the Postal Service reserves the right to make more than one award to procure the services required.  The USPS may elect to use the information received in the responses to this pre-qualification process to satisfy subsequent business needs. 

Late Submissions

Any document received at the office designated in the pre-qualification package after the exact time specified for receipt will not be considered unless it is received before the evaluation takes place, and:
a.	It is the only submission received; or
b.	Consideration of the submission is determined by the contracting officer to be in the Postal Service’s interest.

<DESC><p><strong>COAST GUARD CUTTER ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY MARKET RESEARCH</strong></p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort to assess environmental technologies that might be used on United States Coast Guard cutters to address the Coast Guard's environmental performance goals. As the primary enforcement agency for maritime environmental protection in the United States, the Coast Guard endeavors to outfit cutters to decrease their environmental impact within limits of cost and feasibility. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI. <br /><br />The Coast Guard Research and Development Center (RDC) is conducting research to identify state-of-the art technologies and associated equipment applicable to ship environmental systems. State-of-the art in this context refers to existing technologies that are currently used in commercial and Government ships as well as proven and near-proven technologies that are expected to be available in the commercial and/or Government ship market in the next three years. <br /><br />The USCG RDC intends to use the information collected from this RFI to conduct detailed systems analysis that quantifies and evaluates technology readiness, environmental ship performance, environmental impact and acquisition and life cycle operating costs. <br />For the purpose of this analysis, the following table provides the range of characteristics of large Coast Guard cutters.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cutter Characteristic&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Range</span></strong><br />Length&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;210 to 420 Feet<br />Accommodations&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 85 to 185 People<br />Propulsion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Diesel, Diesel-Electric, or&nbsp;Diesel-Gas Turbine<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5,000 to 75,000 HP<br />Endurance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30 to 90 days of provisions and stores</p>

<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY SPECIFIC CRITERIA</strong></p>
<p><strong>I. BALLAST WATER TREATMENT <br />Notional Operational Profile and Capacity</strong><br />Coast Guard cutters take on ballast over the course of a patrol as necessary to maintain stability. Newer cutter designs, such as the Maritime Security Cutter, Large (WMSL), include segregated seawater ballast tanks with an estimated total capacity of approximately 375 long tons. Ballast would be discharged in preparation for refueling at sea or upon returning to port for refueling. As a ballast treatment rate has not been set, information is requested for a range of suitable rates.<br /><strong><br />Minimum Desired Criteria<br /></strong>The Coast Guard seeks information on Ballast Water Management Systems that are intended to be Coast Guard certified under the proposed regulation 46 CFR 162.060 (74FR44632), phase-one of which would be equivalent to the standard adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in 2004, &lsquo;&lsquo;International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments'' (BWM Convention).</p>
<p><strong>II. MARINE SANITATION DEVICE<br />Notional Operational Profile and Capacity<br /></strong>On Coast Guard vessels, blackwater is human body wastes and the wastes from toilets and other receptacles intended to receive or retain body wastes and the effluent from garbage grinders and garbage disposals. On average, treatment systems would be required to process blackwater at a rate of 600 gallons per days (360 gallons of human waste plus 240 gallons from garbage disposals or garbage grinders.)<br /><br /><strong>Minimum Desired Criteria<br /></strong>The Coast Guard seeks information on Marine Sanitation Devices intended to be Coast Guard certified under 33 CFR 159 and meet the revised MARPOL Annex IV, MEPC 159(55).</p>
<p><strong>III. SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL <br />Notional Operational Profile and Capacity<br /></strong>The Coast Guard seeks information on solid waste disposal systems. The waste stream may be processed in whole or in part by macerators, grinders, pulpers, plasticizers, compactors, incinerators, or any other types of equipment used to process solid waste aboard ships. Systems must be capable of handling all or part of the following nominal waste stream:<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paper and Cardboard Waste</span>: Designed to handle paper and cardboard waste generated at the rate of 200 lb/day at a density of 6.00 lb/ft3 (unprocessed). <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Plastic Waste:</span> Designed to handle plastic waste generated at the rate of 57 lb/day with a density of 1.38 lb/ft3 (unprocessed). <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Food Waste:</span> Designed to handle food waste generated at the rate of 145 lb/day, at a density of 44.8 lb/ft3 (unprocessed). <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Metal and Glass Waste:</span> Designed to handle metal and glass waste at the rate of 65 lb/day, with a density of 11.7 lb/ft3 (unprocessed). <br /><br /><strong>Minimum Desired Criteria</strong> <br />Waste disposal technologies suitable will be appropriately sized for the cutter and limit the carbon footprint. <br />Technologies should meet appropriate MARPOL Annex V criteria (e.g., incinerators to be certificated to the latest IMO requirements, MARPOL Annex VI and IMO Resolution MEPC 76(40) adopted on 25 September 1997, "Standard Specifications of Shipboard Incinerators").</p>
<p><strong>IV. AIR EMISSIONS</strong> <br /><strong>Notional Operational Profile and Capacity<br /></strong>Cutter propulsion plants might be diesel, combined diesel and gas turbine, or diesel-electric. During the course of a patrol, a cutter operates over the full spectrum of her speeds, from idle to full speed. <br /><br /><strong>Minimum Desired Criteria</strong> <br />Growing concern over the environmental impact of shipping has led to local, regional and global action, requiring reductions in emissions such as Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Sulfur Oxides (SOx), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and Particulate Matter (PM.) <br /><br />The Coast Guard is seeking information on marine diesel engines intended to meet EPA Tier IV requirements. It is recognized that manufacturers may be delaying certification testing until required to meet implementation dates, but available information is requested related to estimates of cost and characteristics that will impact design (e.g., requirements for exhaust treatment such as space and weight, and generation of hazardous waste.)</p>
<p><strong>V. OILYWATER SEPARATOR <br />Notional Operational Profile and Capacity<br /></strong>Some existing classes of Coast Guard cutters may use fuel tanks for ballast, creating "dirty" ballast. Newer designs, such as the WMSL, use segregated saltwater ballast limiting the generation of oily wastes.<br /><br /><strong>Minimum Desired Criteria <br /></strong>The Coast Guard seeks information on oilywater separator systems and oil content monitors intended to be Coast Guard certified under 46 CFR 162 and meet IMO Resolution MEPC 107(49) with a capacity of 10 to 50 gallons per hour.</p>

2.0  Statement of Objectives
2.1 PURPOSE: 
The Government is interested in finding out what vendors would be interested in entering into a franchise agreement with the U.S. Government for supplying cable services to Iwakuni, Japan.  All interested parties shall submit their company profile, a description of what the vendor can supply, and any information that the vendor deems beneficial for the Government to consider.   Any pertinent information that would be useful in assisting the Government on any future solicitation that may result from this RFI will be accepted.
Orientation:  The city of Iwakuni is located at 34 N, 132 E, Iwakuni is in the western part of Yamaguchi Prefecture, bordering the Seto Inland Sea. The total area of the city is 872.71 km. 
	The Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni was originally a Japanese military base formed in 1939. Then in 1952, the base officially became a United States military base. Today, MCAS Iwakuni is also shared with the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force. The Current base population is roughly 5,000 families. MCAS Iwakuni will be also be a commercial airport starting in 2012. In 2013/2014, it is planned to move the U.S. Carrier Air Wing from Atsugi to Iwakuni which will further increase the size of the base to roughly 11,000 families.  

Situation: Current cable/internet capabilities.a.	A normal hybrid fiber coax plant is the footprint in place now. The distribution network is limited due to the existence of multiple duct systems on the base.  Because the conduit systems must remain under US Government control all fiber for distribution will be required to be leased or a clause in the contact will need to be included for sharing.  The in ground coax can be turned over to perspective providers with the provision that any modifications, improvements, or changes, will remain in place at the conclusion or termination of any contract.b.	Current population:  736 housing units, 4,500 personnel, and about 100 non residential units.c.	Future population:  1,800 housing units, 10,000 personnel and about 150 non residential units.  This majority of this will be located on the Marine Corps Air Station itself but about 250 residential units and some service providers; fire, security, recreational facilities will be located off base at Atago Mountain.  Atago Mountain.  Atago Mountain is a small community located approximately 5 miles from the base.  The station does not currently have any connectivity to this future location and is expected to lease fiber and copper from Japanese commercial vendors.d.	2012 open competition for High Speed internet.  The station currently has a contract in place that runs through 2012.  At the conclusion of this contract the station will recompete this internet requirement..e.	On base wireless hotspots are already provided by MWR through another contract.f.	Due to limited space and facilities, receiver sites must be located off base and telecommunications lines will be required to be leased via Japanese companies to reach the base, this will be the responsibility of the Contractor.  The majority of the Japanese infrastructure is via fiber optic cable.
End state: The Contractor shall be able to provide cable service to Marine Corps Air Station, Iwakuni with the following standards:a.	Must be digital format.  Our current distribution system, AFN feeds, and commander channels are analog.b.	Multiple tiers of servicea.	 To include a free military tier; providing AFN Channels and base command channels to all outlets.  Particularly Barrack lounges, command locations, etcb.	A scalable channel based off fee for service for content and channel selectionc.	Premium Movie Channels such as Showtime, HBO, Cinemax, or other similar selectionc.	Digital Video Recorder Box set availabilityd.	Local company representation in the form of a sales office and technical support will be required.
Limitations:  a.	Due to security concerns access to manholes is centrally controlled via the telephone office.  Coordination is required to gain access.b.	Access to comm. Rooms and distribution nodes would be granted 24 hr accessc.	On base pop ups for splicing, Taps, and equipment are allowed but no overhead transmission or wires are allowed..d.	Due to the station being an airfield there are RF restrictions that need to be considered.e.	Base access for employees need to meet DOD standards.

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps is currently seeking information for a non-developmental True North Module (TNM) system for the foot-mobile Marine.  The Marine Corps has an operational requirement to provide a device that will enhance the capabilities of the Common Laser Rangefinder (CLRF) system by providing an accurate azimuth measurement referenced to True North.  This will be an improvement over the existing CLRF Digital Magnetic Compass (DMC) which is adversely affected by magnetic disturbances.  The use of the TNM system will enable highly accurate target location in environments where the DMC is adversely affected.  The focus of the system procurement will be on the dismounted, foot-mobile observer; thus leading to a small, lightweight solution which can be used as a portable targeting system in the current theater of operations.  The system will focus on the reduction of size, weight, and complexity.  The attributes that follow describe some of the specific characteristics that are required to provide the desired capability: a) operate and meet accuracy requirements in the presence of magnetic fields (threshold); b) operate and meet accuracy requirements day and night with clear skies (threshold), day and night in all weather conditions (objective); c) operate and meet accuracy requirements in urban canyons, inside of buildings, and under jungle canopy with 150 degrees field of view of the sky (threshold), with no field of view of the sky (objective); d) determine true azimuth in 120 seconds with 8 mils 1 sigma azimuth accuracy and in 150 seconds with 5 mils 1 sigma azimuth accuracy (threshold); e) determine true azimuth during quick close combat engagements in 15 seconds with 10 mils 1 sigma azimuth accuracy (objective); f) operate hand-held without a tripod (objective); g) be interoperable with t! he CLRF (and any part of the TNM that is permanently attached to the CLRF) combined with current Marine Corps targeting equipment, specifically, the AN/PAS-22 Long Range Thermal Imager, the AN/PAS-25 Thermal Laser Spot Imager, and the AN/PVS-14 Monocular Night Vision Device (threshold);  h) weigh less than or equal to 4.5 pounds (threshold), 1.0 pound (objective); and i) export digital data to the Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR).  Hybrid systems are allowable to better meet the attributes listed.  Vendors capable of meeting the attributes stated above by making minor product modifications for integration with the CLRF are encouraged to respond to this notice. Vendors capable of providing a system that demonstrates the attributes stated above, in whole or in part, are invited to submit a response to this notice.  Vendor responses should also provide information on the following topics: (1) maintenance requirements, (2) training requirements, (3) system reliability/availability, (4) warranty, and (5) cost per unit(s).  Vendors should limit formal responses to 12 pages (excluding drawings, pictures, brochures, etc.). Vendors should submit detailed descriptions of any candidates to include drawings, pictures, brochures, etc. that will convey the operating principles as well as general and specific system capabilities and their ability to meet the attributes above. Vendors should describe any past or current contracts whose deliverables satisfy items covered in this announcement, either in whole or in part.  The Government anticipates providing via a bailment agreement GFE of two AN/PEQ-13 Vector 21Bs when requested by qualified bidders after release of the RFP.    The Government anticipates that vendors would have a system at TRL 6 or higher.  The Vector 21B will not be released to foreign companies nor shipped outside of the United States of America.  It is anticipated that two (2) production representative bid samples will be required with submittal of proposals after release of the RFP.  Proposals and bid sample submissions are anticipated within 45 days after release of a formal RFP in the 2nd or 3rd Quarter of FY 2010 and would stipulate completed deliveries within a 12 month period of contract award.  A draft of the Foot-Mobile TNM Performance Specification has been included with this Sources Sought Notice for vendor comment.  Those interested vendors seeking copies of the documents listed in 2.2.4 of the draft Foot-Mobile TNM Performance Specification must submit an email request to kelly.kowalczyk@usmc.mil with the information noted below (e.g. CAGE, DUNS, etc.).  Once received, those vendors receiving copies are notified that provided documents will not be not be released nor conveyed to any third parties and are considered proprietary in nature.  The Government is requesting vendor comments on the draft Foot-Mobile TNM Performance Specification for clarification and technical feasibility; however, the Government is under no obligation to adhere to vendor comments submitted.  Interested sources are requested to respond NLT 4:30pm EST on 6 FEB 2010 stating their CAGE code, DUNS number, copy of GSA schedule, business size, SIC Code, and the complete contact information for a corporate point of contact. Interested sources should respond to Marine Corps Systems Command, ATTN: AFSS (CT026), Kelly Kowalczyk, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134-5050. Proprietary information shall be clearly marked. This RFI is for planning purposes and shall not be construed as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Responses shall be treated as information only and part of market research and will not be shared outside of the Government. All information shall be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government, no entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government as a result of contractor responses to this announcement.

<DESC>Interested parties MUST provide a copy of the agreement with the Harris Corporation to repair these radios with voiding the warranty on the equipment with their response to be considered qualified to participate.  Interested parties MUST be able to repair all of the listed radios.  Work will be performed in Afghanistan.  Interested parties MUST have a facility clearance allowing them access to information classified at the US SECRET level.
The United States Marine Corps has purchased a number of Tactical Hand-Held, High Frequency, and Multi-Band Radios.  The radios include the Harris Falcon II and Falcon III family of radios.  Specific types of radios include the following: AN/PRC-152 hand-held radio, AN/VRC-110 amplified dual-vehicle adapter radio system, the AN/PRC-117F Multi-band radio, the AN/PRC-150 High-Frequency radio, and the newly introduced AN/PRC-117G Multi-Band radio.  Approximately 5,000 and 10,000 of a combination of these radios have been shipped to Afghanistan.   
The required support needed to sustain all of the above radios include the following:  Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) repair, Shop-Replaceable Unit (SRU) repair, fault isolation, quality assurance in-theater readiness sustainment to the Marine Corps greater than 85%; stock, storage, and maintenance of LRUs and SRUs, consumable items, operator training, and equipment installation assistance.  Tracking the transfer of stock and gathering repair data is helpful.
This support would be for a period of one (1) year in the Afghanistan Area of Operation (AOA).  The possibility exists that a total of five (5) years of support is needed.  Support personnel would be required to reside on military installations and operate out of an electronic-maintenance facility.  General-Purpose Test Equipment (GPTE) will be supplied, but Special-Purpose Test Equipment (SPTE) would be the responsibility of the interested parties.  Living quarters may be either tents or semi-permanent facilities, depending upon the location supported.

<DESC>This notice is for informational purposes only.  No information is being requested as a result of this notice.
The Bureau of Reclamation's Upper Colorado and Lower Colorado Regions (UC and LC Regions), in collaboration with representatives of the seven Colorado River Basin States (Basin States), submitted a proposal in June 2009 (see attached) to fund the "Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study" (Study) under Reclamation's Basin Study Program (Program). In September 2009, the Study was selected for funding under the Program. The estimated total cost of the study is $2 million which is equally cost shared by Reclamation and the Basin States (the non-Federal Cost-Share Partners). The study will be conducted over a period of two years, beginning in January 2010. 
Reclamation is seeking consulting services to support the Study at a level yet to be determined.  
The purpose of the study is to conduct a comprehensive study to define current and future imbalances in water supply and demand in the Colorado River Basin (Basin) and the adjacent areas of the Basin States that receive Colorado River water for approximately the next 50 years, and to develop and analyze adaptation and mitigation strategies to resolve those imbalances.
The study will characterize current and future water supply and demand imbalances in the Basin and assess the risks to Basin resources. Resources include water allocations and deliveries consistent with the apportionments under the Law of the River; hydroelectric power generation; recreation; fish, wildlife, and their habitats (including candidate, threatened, and endangered species); water quality including salinity; flow and water dependent ecological systems; and flood control.
This requirement will be utilizing the GSA schedules.  For questions regarding this effort, contact Meagan Fyffe, at mfyffe@usbr.gov.

<DESC>PROPOSERS' DAY CONFERENCE
<p>DARPA will host a Proposers' Day Workshop in support of BAA-10-24, Fine Detail Optical Surveillance (FDOS), on 05 February 2010 at Schafer Corporation, 3811 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203 from 8:30am to 4:00pm. The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the FDOS program, promote additional discussion on this topic, address questions from potential proposers, and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.</p>
<p>PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION: <br />The FDOS program will develop a fundamentally new optical ISR capability that can provide ultra high-resolution 3D images for rapid, in-field identification of a diverse set of targets. The systems will be developed for use in an active battlefield or hostile environments with designs tailored to allow for soldier portable applications as well as UAV integration. Targets of interest will include a variety of surfaces and complexities to be imaged under turbulent conditions.</p>
<p>Under the FDOS program several different prototype systems, based on a common approach, will be developed that can provide imagery of moving targets at a number of different ranges and resolutions, with the size, weight, and power of the systems commensurate with the operation range. The field of view (FOV) and depth of field (DOF) of the optical system should be sufficiently large to obviate the need for steering or focusing of the receiver to obtain a full high-resolution image of a target whose relative position may be uncertain.</p>
<p>The program can be described as developing the technology and systems analogous to that required for the rapid imaging and identification, without the need for scanning or focusing of the optical receiver, of a needle moving along the surface of a haystack, where the location and type of needle on the haystack is uncertain.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION: <br />Participants must register no later than close of business (5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time) 27 January 2010 via an email to DARPA-BAA-10-24@darpa.mil with subject line "Proposers' Day Workshop Registration." Due to space limitations of the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 60 registrants and to no more than 2 representatives per organization.</p>
<p>When registering for the conference, please include the following information in the body of the email:<br />&bull; Full Name<br />&bull; Company Name<br />&bull; Company Mailing Address<br />&bull; Email <br />&bull; Phone<br />&bull; Fax (if applicable)<br />&bull; Special Dietary Requirements</p>
<p><br />A SECRET clearance will be required for this meeting. <br />Clearances must be passed by 27 January 2010, using one of the methods below. POC information should be annotated as: FDOS Proposers' Day Workshop.</p>
<p>- JPAS (preferred method): SMO Code 9M027.<br />- Fax: Schafer Special Security Office, 3811 North Fairfax Drive, Suite 400, Arlington, VA 22203. Primary Fax: (703) 516-6031. Alternate Fax: (703) 516-6043.</p>
<p>Any security related questions and concerns should be directed to Tom Fitzgerald, (703) <br />516-6061. Workshop attendance is not required to propose to BAA-10-24.</p>
<p>A confirmation email that includes directions to the facility and other additional information will be sent to your provided email address upon receipt of clearance. There is no registration fee for attending this conference.</p>
<p>Additionally, attendees who would like to present company overviews, discuss their technology expertise, and/or discuss teaming opportunities in scheduled presentations at the conference may request to do so. Presentations may contain four (4) slides and are limited to five (5) minutes each (including logistical issues). Proposers desiring to reserve a time to present at the Proposers' Day Conference should contact the BAA Administrator at DARPA-BAA-10-24@darpa.mil as soon as possible, but no later than the registration cutoff date for the Proposers' Day Conference.</p>
<p>All material to be displayed at the conference must be approved in advance by the DARPA Program Manager. The DARPA Program Manager will screen the proposed material and approve in advance any presentations. It is the presenter's responsibility to ensure that all material they plan to present at the Proposers' Day Conference has been approved by the funding organization in advance. An electronic copy of all material to be presented must be provided to the BAA Coordinator (DARPA-BAA-10-24@darpa.mil) for the Program Manager's review by 27 January 2010.

The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334513, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

*****No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by January 11, 2010 at 10:00am eastern time will be considered by the Government.

The total estimated amount of these purchases is expected to approach $11,500,000.  The Navy and Marine Corps aviation training systems Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) platforms and major subsystems to which this synopsis applies are annotated in Attachment (A).  While this synopsis serves as a pre-solicitation notice of the sole source acquisitions for spare and repair parts from the OEMs listed in Attachment (A), it is not intended to preclude the Government from acquiring spare and repair parts through the training system design/build contractor, as this strategy may serve the Government's best interest.  Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations 6.302, the proposed contract actions are for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and only negotiate with Attachment (A) sources.

Responses to this Sources Sought notice shall be received no later than fifteen (15) days from the posting date.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether respondents should be added to Attachment (A).  In those situations where the Government determines that identical parts are available from more than one source, it will compete these acquisitions among the identified sources.  A determination by the Government not to compete these proposed contract actions based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>The US Army CECOM Contracting Center  Washington, on behalf of the Department of Defense Project Manager  Mobile Electric Power, intends to solicit and negotiate with DRS Sustainment Systems, Inc. for an additional 160 Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 60,000 (60k) British Thermal Units per Hour (BTUH) Improved Environmental Control Units (IECUs) manufactured by DRS Sustainment Systems, Inc.  The 60k BTUH IECU is a military ruggedized field environmental control unit that is designed to provide temperature control in environments ranging from -50 degree F to +125 degree F.  The 60k BTUH IECU program is a joint Army and Air Force effort to replace heavy and inefficient Environmental Control Units (ECUs).  The 60K IECUs are lighter in weight than the existing military ECUs which are used to provide environmental control to Force Providers, Deployable Medical Systems and Tactical Operations Centers.  In an attempt to reduce the logistics footprint and increase system deployability, the 60K IECU will be deployed to all Services, but primarily to the Army and Air Force.  Effective 1 January 2010, the current Clean Air Act and the Montreal Accord (to which the U.S. is a signatory) requires the cessation of the manufacture of Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems using ozone depleting chemicals. The 60K IECU is the Armys only standard HVAC system, with full Integrated Logistics Support that meets this requirement.  It is the intent of the Army to increase Firm-Fixed-Price CLINs within the existing 60k IECUs contract number W909MY-06-C-0032, for the purchase of additional 160 LRIP 60k BTUH IECUs and extended the contracts period of performance from 30 April 2010 to 1 November 2010.  <BR><BR>It is the intent of this office to award this modification to contract W909MY-06-C-0032 on the basis of other than full and open competition under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  However, all responsible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully provide the required 60k BTUH IECUs may submit a proposal that will be considered by the agency.  Responses are to be received via E-mail within 10 calendar days of the date of this notice.  All requests for further information must be in writing via E-mail.  Telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.  You may forward responses to the following E-mail address:  james.boehm1@us.army.mil.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.
The solicitation number for this request is 70181-A-Q032 and is issued as a request for quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 05-38) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
This procurement is a small business set-aside. The applicable NAICS classification code is 562991 with size standard of $7M and PSC code is S222. 
SPECIFICATIONSThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is requesting quotes for septic pumping at 33665 Keystone Drive off of East Redoubt in Soldotna, Alaska.  Pumping will be on a regular schedule of every 2 weeks.  The Contractor will furnish septic pumping services, which includes all equipment, supervision, transportation, labor, operating supplies, and incidentals necessary to pump, clean up, and dispose of all waste products removed from the septic tank.
Salient Characteristics:Outhouses:Furnish when called, within 24 hours or less, toilet pumping services which includes all equipment, supervision, transportation, labor, operating supplies, and incidentals necessary to pump and remove, clean up, disinfect, and dispose of all waste products removed from the toilets.  Pumping includes sewage, liquid, semi-liquid, and solid waste matter.  This includes removal of any other refuse found in vault toilets regardless of the method of removal.  Thoroughly clean and disinfect all contaminated areas resulting from pumping around the pump-out cover.  Sweep or wash all waste that is deposited on the concrete surrounding the pump-out cover back into the vault.  When pumping through the toilet riser when there is no outside pump-out, debris should not be removed or pumped through the toilet riser without removing the riser.  Extra care shall be taken to prevent waste spillage onto the floor and wall surface while pumping, in order to prevent the toilet paper from becoming contaminated or otherwise unusable.  Sweep or wash all of the spilled waste back into the vault.  The contractor shall not allow the spilled waste to be washed or swept out through the door because the waste will collect at the edge of the concrete and the dirt or gravel and will become a possible health risk and an odor problem.  In the event spillage occurs, the affected floor and wall surfaces will be washed and disinfected.  The inside and outside of the toilet riser, the seat, and the cover shall also be washed and disinfected before replacing the riser, if the riser was removed for pumping.  The door handles or knobs shall also be disinfected if they were used in the course of pumping.  The contractor is responsible to prevent spillage and to be properly licensed.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, are being utilized for this acquisition. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-36. <br />
<p><br />Offerors will be responsible for obtaining related amendments to this solicitation, if any, from www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of each potential offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to this solicitation. Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to Keith Bubar at keith.bubar@nist.gov and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.<br /><br />The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541519, with the exception provided for Information Technology Value Added Resellers with a size standard of 150 employees. This acquisition cannot be conducted as a small business set aside because there is no U.S. Small Business Administration waiver to the non-manufacturer rule for NAICS code 541519. This requirement is being competed as an unrestricted full and open competition whereby CheckPoint-authorized resellers/business partners will be the potential offeror base.<br /><br />APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES FOR THIS SOLICITATION:<br />The Following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:<br />FAR 52.212-1; FAR 52.212-3; FAR 52.212-4; FAR 52.212-5, including the following fill-ins: 52.219-28; 52.222-3; 52.222-19; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-36; 52.225-13; 52.232-33. All provisions and clauses viewed at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory (Division 837) requires the purchase of CheckPoint brand name firewall appliances to replace an existing firewall. CheckPoint has a number of authorized resellers/business partners that sell their firewall appliances and the support for these items. <br /><br />CLIN 0001<br />Part Number: CPAP-SG1076<br />CheckPoint UUTM-1 1076 Total Security Appliance<br />Quantity: 1; Unit: Each</p>
<p>CLIN 0002<br />Part Number: CPAP-SG1076-HA<br />Secondary CheckPoint UTM-1 1076 Total Security Appliance<br />Quantity: 1; Unit: Each</p>
<p>CLIN 0003<br />Part Number: CPAP-SM504<br />CheckPoint Smart-1 Security Management 5 Gateways with 4 Blades<br />Quantity: 1; Unit: Each</p>
<p>CLIN 0004<br />Part Number: CPES-SS-STANDARD<br />CheckPoint Standard Support and Subscription 12 Months<br />Quantity: 1; Unit: Year</p>
<p>BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:<br />This is a request for CheckPoint brand name firewall appliances and support for NIST Division 837. The products requested will be used to replace an existing firewall appliance utilized by NIST Division 837. This firewall appliance must support the existing Cisco hardware VPN in place. It must also be compatible with existing firewall hardware and software that is owned and maintained by the NIST Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO). These items were purchased on a previous order, and are CheckPoint brand name firewall appliances. The only firewall appliances that will be compatible with these are Checkpoint brand name products. By purchasing CheckPoint firewall appliances that are compatible with products already in use in the NIST OCIO, this will allow Division 837 to utilize the NIST OCIO technical resources to maintain IT security configuration as mandated by the NIST OCIO. This would not be possible if firewall appliances of another brand name were purchased.<br /><br />Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, does not apply to this acquisition because the items are located in spaces frequented only by service personnel for maintenance, repair or occasional monitoring of equipment. <br /><br />All responsible offerors that are CheckPoint-authorize resellers/business partners are invited to submit quotations in accordance with the instructions below.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO PROVISION 52.212-1 - QUOTATION SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS<br />(a) Submission of quotations.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Circular A-123 is a re-examination of the existing internal control requirements for Federal agencies and was initiated in light of the new internal control requirements for publicly-traded companies contained in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

This project consists of furnishing all plant, labor, materials and equipment. This effort involves dredging to a depth of 20 feet, plus 2 feet allowable over depth, along with the removal of approximately 440,500 cubic yards of shoal material. The dredged material is to be placed on the shoreline approximately 6,500 to 8,400 feet west of the site by an ocean going hydraulic dredge. Performance of all work must be in strict accordance with the specifications and drawings. The selected contractor will be required to diligently commence work within 5 calendar days and complete the work no later than 90 calendar days after receipt of the Notice to Proceed (NTP). The time stated for completion includes final cleanup of the premises. Plans/Specs for the subject project would be available on/about 24 MAR 2009 with bid opening on/about 8 JUN 2009.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6 AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. <br />**************************************************************************************<br />Purchase Request Number: F3W7169329A001 Request for Proposal. This document incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.<br />**************************************************************************************<br />The following clauses and provisions apply to this solicitation (available from http://farsite.hill.af.mil)
<p>52.212-1 - INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS</p>
<p>52.212-2 - EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. A purchase order will be issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror representing the best value to the Government. An evaluation of "Technically Acceptable" will be assigned when the minimum acceptable criteria are clearly met by the proposal and the offeror meets the performance and technical capability<br />requirements defined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).</p>
<p>Candidate resumes and transcripts are required to be submitted with proposals. Interviews may be conducted to supplement the information contained in the proposals. Proposal must be submitted on an all or none basis.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>-- After determining that a complete and acceptable proposal has been received in accordance with the requirements documented in 52.212-1, offers shall initially be ranked according to price, as identified under the Description of requirement above. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified by the proposed unit price for each Item to confirm the extended amount. The price evaluation process will document the completeness and reasonableness of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>--Next, the government technical team shall evaluate, on a pass/fail basis, the technical proposals submitted by the lowest priced offerors (approximately the lowest 5 proposals) against the following evaluation factor:</p>
<p>Resume and Transcripts: Resumes and transcripts submitted will be evaluated to determine if the employee meets the requirements indicated in the PWS. If the offeror is the sole employee, only the offeror's resume and transcripts are required. If the offeror is a company proposing a staffing relationship, resumes and transcripts for any/all employees intended to fill the position are required.</p>
<p>By submission of an offer, the offeror accedes to these terms. Award will be made without discussions - contractors are encouraged to offer their most advantageous pricing with their response. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from both a price and a technical standpoint. Failure of an offeror's proposal to meet any given requirement may result in the entire proposal being found to be unacceptable and eliminated from further consideration.</p>
<p>Once determinations are made regarding technical acceptability of proposals, award will be made to the lowest priced offeror who submitted a proposal rated technically acceptable. (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding<br />contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. 
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
     Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC>Added 01/06/2010:<br /><br />Questions and Answers from the RFI process:<br />
<p>Q. Is there an incumbant vendor or is this a new requirement?<br />A. This is a new requirement/<br /><br />Q. Is this the same requirement posted last April under DOL099RP20664 and RFI 67-099E-801?<br />A. Yes<br /><br />Q. The sources sought clearly states that "offerer shall used Java as the programming language".&nbsp; However, the SSN also states that "Offeror shall seek formal written approval of the GPO for each alternative selected for the development of this system."&nbsp; Will any proposals be considered if they do not propose a technology/application written on Java?&nbsp; If so, what written request is required in order to obtain written approval of the GPO? <br /><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Garamond">A. Yes, proposals will be considered if they propose a technology that is not written on Java.&nbsp; As you may be aware, this programming is a standard used within the web development community at this time but advancements in this technology environment are changing constantly.&nbsp; The OFCCP wanted to establish a baseline for software application development environment that is generally available to the Vendor community.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><span><span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">Q. &nbsp;</span></span></span>The sources sought says that the system must be web-based and preferably COTS.&nbsp; Cloud Computing applications fit both of these requirements, but most are not written in Java.&nbsp; Will OFCCP consider a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) hosted application as a potential software solution?<br /><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Garamond">A. Yes.&nbsp; When the effort was initially started this environment was not in existence.&nbsp; As stated above, in order to establish a baseline for the software application development environment, the language provided in the solicitation was relevant services generally available within the Vendor community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br />Q.&nbsp;We are&nbsp;a CMMI Level 2 certified company but we use CMMI Level 3 procedures in development.&nbsp; Will this disqualify me as a capable company?<br />A.&nbsp;No.&nbsp; However it may impact the technical rating at time of RFP evaluations.&nbsp; If a vendor is in the process of upgrading their certificate level this effort should be mentioned as part of the RFI and RFP submissions.<br /><br />Q. We have many years experience as a subcontractor in this type of work but not as the prime.&nbsp; Are we still eligible?<br />A. Yes<br /><br />Q. Can we mention our Prime partner as part of our proposal?<br />A. Yes if this partnership is reasonably expected to be used for your RFP submission.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  The ! program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Government's inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares an! d product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.   Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1. Capability to meet all technical requirements 2. Capability to provide Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) 3. Ability to demonstrate systems integration across the aircraft fleet 4. Capability to produce technically competent analyses on the multiple areas covered in the above paragraph 5. Description of previous or current experience in precision targeting systems 6. Show ability to start delivery on or about 14 months ARO.  The ASC/647th AESS/TZ Program Office intends to host an industry day at Wright Patterson Air Force Base at a date to be determined to discuss the capability requirements for the ATP-SE in greater detail.  This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any competitive aspects of the acquisition. Accordingly, each respondent is requested to clarify whether any teaming arrangements are contemplated (including Small and Small Disadvantaged Business participation). Based upon receipt of responses and analysis, a determination will be made to ascertain the Government position of other than full and open versus a competitive solicitation. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business concern, a minority institution, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334511 "Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aer! onautical, and Nautical System and Instrument manufacturing" applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 750 employees.

Update: ASC 647 AESS ATP-SE IDIQ TASK ORDER CONTRACT DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this update is to reiterate to industry that information about the pending source selection, requirements for ATP-SE, or any other discussions pertaining to the ATP-SE that may occur with industry shall not be considered a requirement or direction unless that information has originated from the PCO, Mr. Robert Hixenbaugh. The ATP-SE team has been made aware of communication between the user and a contractor that may have related perceived requirements specifically "non-developmental ATP-SE system procured as a result of this sources sought synopsis will require a single OFP" This is not a currently planned requirement.  All future requirements for ATP-SE will be released to all potential Offerors through the PCO. If any Offeror believes they have received direction or guidance on the upcoming program it is incumbent upon them to disregard that information/not act upon that information if it has not come from the PCO. This announcement does not relieve the potential offerors from the previous request for submitting the capabilities statements on or before the 16 May deadline.This is not a request for proposal and no response is required.    The PCO shall be the sole POC for any and all communication regarding this acquisition: Kimberly Henderson, (937) 255-7682, email kimberly.henderson@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes. This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 52.215-3 --   Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of  this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except  as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection  31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although “proposal” and “offeror” are used in this Request for  Information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall  not be used as a proposal. (c) Background:  The C-17 Training Systems Integrated Product Team at  Wright-Patterson AFB OH is responsible for the development, fielding and  sustainment of aircrew and maintenance training devices, concurrency of  those devices, and aircrew instruction.  The breadth of this effort  expands across eight USAF bases in CONUS, two in PACAF, and an Australian  FMS base.  The C-17 Aircrew Training System (ATS) is comprised of seven  different training devices of which, to date, 163 out of 179 devices have  been fielded.  The C-17 Maintenance Training System (MTS), on the other  hand, is comprised of ten different devices with 28 of 37 devices fielded.  Whereas ATS devices can be found at every C-17 base, only seven USAF bases  will eventually house the MTS devices. (d) The purpose of this RFI is to assist the program office with the  formulation of the acquisition strategy and to ascertain your interest in  bidding on a 10-year C-17 ATS/MTS Sustainment Re-Compete program.  This  program is comprised of three components; 1) ATS and MTS Contractor  Logistics Support (CLS), 2) ATS Instruction, and 3) ATS and MTS  Concurrency Management.  The offerors will be asked to bid on a combined  program encapsulating all of the components list above.  They will also be  given the opportunity to bid on an ATS-only piece  (CLS/Instruction/Concurrency) and/or an MTS-only piece (CLS/Concurrency). 1.  Describe your past experience for performing contractor logistics  support, instruction, and/or concurrency management to include: •	Program name •	Government or contractor POC •	Description of the effort; i.e., number of locations supported, number  of personnel assigned, etc. •	Date & period of performance •	Cost of effort •	Description of support strategy, i.e., guaranteed student, on-call,  modified on-call, etc. 2.	In an effort to instill contractual flexibility to react quickly to  budget fluctuations, we’re looking for ways to implement a “throttle”  mechanism.  By this we want the capability to surge as well a scale back  on the CLS effort.  What ideas might you have to accomplish this and have  you implemented it on a previous program? 3.  What innovative ways have you used in the past, or could possibly  envision to keep CLS costs down to include integrating the two systems  together? 4.  In carrying out this effort, what would be your reliance on government  personnel and what would be required of them? 5.  What data will you require of the government to assemble a proposal  for this effort? 6.  What risks do you foresee in performing this effort?  What steps would  you likely take to mitigate the risks? Contractors responding to this announcement should indicate their size,  particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically  disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business  concern, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Native  American-Owned Small Business, and should also indicate if the company is  foreign-owned.  Interested sources are encouraged to first register as a  source on the PIXS Web Site (www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil).  Interested sources  must respond with a complete Request for Information package of no more  than 10 pages though, providing everything requested above. All parties  are asked to provide a point of contact, a telephone number, an e-mail  address, and a facsimile number in their response. This information should be sent electronically to Mr Rick Fennell at  ricky.fennell@wpafb.af.mil.  Responses should be received no later than 15  March 2007.

This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 52.215-3 --   Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of  this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except  as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection  31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although ?proposal? and ?offeror? are used in this Request for  Information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall  not be used as a proposal. (c) Background:  The C-17 Training Systems Integrated Product Team at  Wright-Patterson AFB OH is responsible for the development, fielding and  sustainment of aircrew and maintenance training devices, concurrency of  those devices, and aircrew instruction.  The breadth of this effort  expands across eight USAF bases in CONUS, two in PACAF, and an Australian  FMS base.  The C-17 Aircrew Training System (ATS) is comprised of seven  different training devices of which, to date, 163 out of 179 devices have  been fielded.  The C-17 Maintenance Training System (MTS), on the other  hand, is comprised of ten different devices with 28 of 37 devices fielded.  Whereas ATS devices can be found at every C-17 base, only seven USAF bases  will eventually house the MTS devices. (d) The purpose of this RFI is to assist the program office with the  formulation of the acquisition strategy and to ascertain your interest in  bidding on a 10-year C-17 ATS/MTS Sustainment Re-Compete program.  This  program is comprised of three components; 1) ATS and MTS Contractor  Logistics Support (CLS), 2) ATS Instruction, and 3) ATS and MTS  Concurrency Management.  The offerors will be asked to bid on a combined  program encapsulating all of the components list above.  They will also be  given the opportunity to bid on an ATS-only piece  (CLS/Instruction/Concurrency) and/or an MTS-only piece (CLS/Concurrency). 1.  Describe your past experience for performing contractor logistics  support, instruction, and/or concurrency management to include: ?	Program name ?	Government or contractor POC ?	Description of the effort; i.e., number of locations supported, number  of personnel assigned, etc. ?	Date & period of performance ?	Cost of effort ?	Description of support strategy, i.e., guaranteed student, on-call,  modified on-call, etc. 2.	In an effort to instill contractual flexibility to react quickly to  budget fluctuations, we?re looking for ways to implement a ?throttle?  mechanism.  By this we want the capability to surge as well a scale back  on the CLS effort.  What ideas might you have to accomplish this and have  you implemented it on a previous program? 3.  What innovative ways have you used in the past, or could possibly  envision to keep CLS costs down to include integrating the two systems  together? 4.  In carrying out this effort, what would be your reliance on government  personnel and what would be required of them? 5.  What data will you require of the government to assemble a proposal  for this effort? 6.  What risks do you foresee in performing this effort?  What steps would  you likely take to mitigate the risks? Contractors responding to this announcement should indicate their size,  particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically  disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business  concern, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Native  American-Owned Small Business, and should also indicate if the company is  foreign-owned.  Interested sources are encouraged to first register as a  source on the PIXS Web Site (www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil).  Interested sources  must respond with a complete Request for Information package of no more  than 10 pages though, providing everything requested above. All parties  are asked to provide a point of contact, a telephone number, an e-mail  address, and a facsimile number in their response. This information should be sent electronically to Mr Rick Fennell at  ricky.fennell@wpafb.af.mil.  Responses should be received no later than 15  March 2007. The 677 AESG/TS will present a status brief on the C-17 Training Systems  Sustainment Re-Compete at I/ITSEC in Orlando on 28 Nov 07.  The briefing  will start at 0900 in Rm 315B.

<DESC>The Communications and Electronic Command (CECOM), located in Aberdeen, MD has a requirement for Counterintelligence / Human Intelligence (CI/HUMINT) software development, systems development, hardware procurement, integration, testing, fielding, training, deployment and sustainment. This Request for Information (RFI) is to assist the Government in developing a path forward for Increment 2 of the Counterintelligence/Human Intelligence Automated Reporting and Collection System (CHARCS). The purpose of this RFI is to determine if there are sources capable of satisfying the Governments requirements. Feedback addressing the clarity, feasibility, scope, and potential alternative means of meeting the Governments requirement is sought. The Government is looking for a solution for CHARCS Increment 2 and its peripherals, if available, including all components, software development, hardware procurement, software, hardware, integration, training, delivery and maintenance and field support.  The Government seeks to ascertain the suitability and risk of providing the CHARCS Increment 1 source code as a part of a future solicitation.  For the purposes of this RFI, the respondents will be given access to the CHARCS Increment 1 hardware and software at a Government reading room.  The purpose of providing access is to assist the respondents in providing feedback on the quality and suitability of existing hardware and software for Increment 2.  The Government will provide a specific location where the interested companies can view the CHARCS Increment 1 hardware and software.  Copies of classified information will NOT be released.  Companies who are interested in viewing the CHARCS Increment 1 hardware and software are allowed a maximum of four individuals who must possess current SECRET clearances.  Companies will be responsible for submitting Clearance Visit Requests (CVRs) to Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) Code W6DU013.  Visitor requests must be received by the Acquisition Sponsor Project Officer(ASPO) Security Team no later than 14 January 2010.  ASPO Security Team Points of Contact (POCs) for visit requests are Yolanda Knight  at 703-428-8872 and James Lewis at 703-428-8805.  Scheduled visitation for source code examination is required.  Source code examination will occur 19-22 January 2010 and 25-27 January 2010 from 0800-1700 hours . Source code examination appointments will be available in a maximum eight (8) hour block per day.  Appointment times are first come first served.  No other times are allotted. One appointment per Company is permitted.  POC for scheduling times is MAJ Isaac Williams at 703-704-3185.  Failure to provide a JPAS CVRs and failure to conduct prior coordination for visitation time will result in denial of access to the classified information.<BR>The Government has identified the following capability peripherals as a requirement for the CHARCS Increment 2 system configuration: Counter Human Deception Detection Device; Digital Media Forensics Device; Document and Media Exploitation Device (DOMEX) Machine Language Translation Text to Text, Speech to Speech, Text to Speech and Speech to Text, and Handheld device (HH) Handheld Biometric Collection Device. Although the majority of work associated with this solicitation is SECRET Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals/Governments/Non-US Citizens (NOFORN), there is the possibility that there will be classification requirements for up to the TOP SECRET/Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) level. Contractor personnel are required to have Department of Defense (DoD) security clearances to the TOP SECRET/SCI level for key personnel. Responders are required to have a (COMSEC) account. Handling of material up to SECRET NOFORN is required. Storage clearances of at least the SECRET NOFORN level are required and arrangements shall be made if necessary for Top Secret/SCI storage. <BR><BR>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes  it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the U.S. Government to a contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Furthermore, the U.S. Government  is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI and all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partys expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if one is issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website through the Interactive Business Opportunity Page (IBOP) (see Response paragraph of the RFI for IBOP e-mail address). It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.<BR><BR>Background<BR><BR>CHARCS is incrementally introduced through two distinct versions of preplanned blocks of functionality. In the baseline hardware from Increment 1 it does not change with Counterintelligence Human Intelligence Automated Tool Set (CHATS) (AN/PYQ-3) and Individual Tactical Report Tool (ITRT) (AN/PYQ-8).  In Increment 2 the hardware additions change to having mission specific Peripheral Sets and Kits (PSKs); Collection PSKs; Document  and Media Exploitation (DOMEX) PSKs; and other PSKs; and CI/Interrogation/Biometrics, (a handheld collection device and a counter human deception device).  <BR><BR>The CHARCS toolset is used for CI and HUMINT collection, reporting, and dissemination; software development, which includes a web-enabled access; supports team-level contact management; identification of intra-team, inter-team, and communications capability; beyond Line-of-Sight (LOS) on the move report transmission capability; interrogation management tool; source optimization management tools; development of software to incorporate management and use of Intelligence Contingency Funds (ICF) user forms; peripheral devices for workstation/basic office management; Additional functional specialty PSKs; and software development which incorporates standard set of modifiable CI and HUMINT reports and forms with Universal Message Text Formats (UMTFs). In the future, CHARCS Increment 2 may be required to leverage and host selected functional software applications and hardware developed by other emerging programs of record. These related systems currently include the following:  1. Biometric Automation Toolset (BAT) for capturing, recording, and reporting biometric information on individuals of interest and, 2. Machine Foreign Language Translation System (MFLTS); a base line currently under development which provides Machine Language Translation (MLT) use for recording speech to speech translation,text to text translation, speech to text and text to speech and transliteration for Document and Media Exploitation (DOMEX) missions. CHARCS interoperates with Distributed Common Ground System  Army (DCGS-A).  As part of evaluating any response received, CECOM will be assessing the potential existence of other sources and is requesting capability packages from industry on the requirements below. The Government is looking for information on potential sources with the ability to perform the following items, with the support of sub-contractors, if needed.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">The registration cutoff date has been extended from 4:00PM ET, January 7, 2010 to 4:00PM ET, January 11, 2010.&nbsp; See below for the&nbsp;revised Proposer's Day Workshop Announcement for Transformer (TX).<br /><br /><br />DARPA-SN-10-14 <br />Proposer's Day Workshop Announcement</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Transformer (TX)<br />Tactical Technology Office<br />Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</p>
<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Workshop in support of a planned Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Transformer (TX) program. The workshop will occur at 0700-1500 EST on January 14, 2010, at Westin Arlington Gateway, 801 North Glebe Road, Arlington, VA 22203.</p>
<p>This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and program planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Workshop is intended to introduce to the research community the TX program vision, goals and objectives, and opportunities associated with the development of interdisciplinary teams to respond to an anticipated Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). The workshop does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Attendance at the workshop is voluntary and is not required to propose to any potential related Broad Agency Announcements or potential research solicitations on this topic. DARPA will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred to participate in this Industry Day.</p>
<p>The objective of the Transformer (TX) program is to demonstrate a 1 to 4 person transportation vehicle that can drive and fly, thus enabling the warfighter to avoid water, difficult terrain, and road obstructions as well as IED and ambush threats. The vehicle will be capable of driving on prepared surface and light off-road conditions, while flight functionality will require Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL). In addition, range and speed efficiencies will allow for tactically relevant missions to be performed on a single tank of fuel. The ability to provide the warfighter a platform that enables terrain-independent mobility would significantly affect how distributed operations are performed today. Current transport systems present operational limitations where the warfighter is either anchored to the ground with HMMWVs and thus vulnerable to ambush, or reliant on helicopters, which are limited in flight speed and availability. TX provides the flexibility to adapt to traditional and asymmetric threats by providing the operator unimpeded movement over difficult terrain. In addition, transportation is no longer restricted to trafficable terrain that tends to makes movement predictable. The TX vehicle also allows the warfighter to approach targets from directions opportune to them and not the enemy.</p>
<p>Within the TX program, DARPA seeks to: 1) Develop a robust vehicle design that maximizes military utility at a reasonable cost, 2) Identify and mature the critical enabling technologies necessary to vehicle development, and 3) Build a single prototype vehicle that demonstrates the program goals through ground and flight tests. Technologies relevant to the objectives of the TX program can be found in numerous disciplines and areas of research including: hybrid electric drive, advanced batteries, adaptive wing structures, ducted fan propulsion, lightweight composite materials, advanced flight control technology for stable transition from vertical to horizontal flight, and others.</p>
<p>To facilitate maximum participation DARPA will host a TX Proposers' Day Workshop. The workshop will: (a) Introduce the research community (industry, academia, and Government) to the TX program vision and objectives; (b) Explain the mechanics of a DARPA program and the milestones and metrics of this potential effort; and (c) Promote teaming arrangements among organizations having relevant expertise, facilities, and capabilities to execute an interdisciplinary research program responsive to the TX program goals. The workshop will include overview presentations by Government personnel and a poster session to facilitate interaction and team building among the session participants. Potential participants should note that formation of teams with sufficient expertise to address all technical areas is critical. Workshop participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters describing areas of capabilities in order to facilitate discussions during the poster session.</p>
<p>There is no fee to attend the TX Proposers' Day Workshop. Registration for the workshop is limited by the venue capacity. To maximize the number of organizations participating, there is a limit of three persons per organization. Early registration is strongly recommended. The poster session will be limited to 1 poster per organization with a cut-off of 100 posters total. The registration cutoff date has been extended to 4:00PM ET, January 11, 2010.</p>
<p>Workshop details including registration, poster session, meeting location, and lodging are provided on the registration website.</p>
<p>Workshop Details: <br />Time: January 14, 2010, 7:00am-3:00pm<br />Location: Westin Arlington Gateway<br />801 North Glebe Road<br />Arlington, VA 22203 <br />(800) 627-7076 (Reservations)<br />(703) 717-6200 (Hotel Operator)<br />Registration Website: http://www.sa-meetings.com/TX2010 (Password = TX2010)</p>

<DESC><p>RECOVERY ACT PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE FOR ROOF AND ENERGY REPAIR AND ALTERATIONS PROJECT, LOCATED IN CHARLESTON, WV, SOLICITATION NO.: GS-03P-10-CD-C-0015.</p>
<p>This project is an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act project. The United States General Services Administration has a requirement for the selection of a quality contractor for the "Recovery": Roof and Energy Repair and Alterations project for the Robert C. Byrd Courthouse in Charleston, West Virginia. This project is to be awarded as a firm fixed price contract. The work includes but is not limited to the following: provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary to remove and replace existing roof, installation of roof-supported photovoltaic panels, replacement of existing lighting with LED type fixtures and modification to existing mechanical system to provide further energy and cost savings.</p>
<p>The Robert C. Byrd U. S. Courthouse was selected for its potential energy generation capacity. This project will have a positive savings-to-investment ratio; it will enhance the resilience and security of the building/facility by providing an additional source of power to meet the building/facility's needs while reducing the reliance on local utility providers.</p>
<p>As part of a long-term plan to maintain and modernize government owned facilities, the General Services Administration (GSA) intends to procure construction services outlined within the scope of work intended for this site. This project will enhance the ability of the GSA to move closer to achieving goals outlined in the Energy act of 2007 that include new standards for promoting energy efficiency in government buildings. Consequently, the award of this project will assist in the overall goals of stimulating the economy and creating jobs.</p>
<p>The estimated cost of construction is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00. Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. Accordingly, award will be made using best-value, source-selection procedures incorporating tradeoffs between price-related and non-price related factors. Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors. Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer will preclude further participation on this acquisition.</p>
<p>Award may be made without discussions. The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance: 1.Past Performance, 2. Management and Key Personnel Qualifications, and 3. Technical and Organizational Approach. The NAICS code applicable to this project is 236220.

This also includes features such as grade control riffles, temporary erosion control features, and appropriate woody debris and vegetation for stabilization. The length of the new stream channels will be about 450-feet in length. A notched weir structure across the pond where a beaver dam currently sits would be constructed. This structure would ensure that current water levels and fluctuations are maintained. This structure would consist of a sheet pile wall that would be covered in glacial stone, woody debris and/or vegetation to make it look more natural. The small notch would allow a continuous flow down through the created stream channel. The length of the control structure is about 320-feet. Finally, the restoration of native vegetation communities in any area that is directly affected by the dam modification, stream channel formation and water draw down would be implemented. Appropriate vegetation communities would be planted according to hydrology. These are anticipated to be marsh, wet meadow and wet forest type communities. The total area affected is about 4-acres. Existing metal culverts would be replaced with 36" RCP pipe that would allow vehicles and people to walk the path without fording these small seep streams. By replacing the culvert, stream channel connectivity, hydrology and hydraulics would be restored. Appropriate native seep vegetation would be planted as well. This measure also ensures seeps would remain stable after the dam is bypassed.&nbsp; The classification code for this procurement is North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 237990, with a business size standard of $33.5M.&nbsp;COMPETITION IS UNRESTRICTED TO BUSINESS SIZE.&nbsp; The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a firm-fixed price construction contract.&nbsp; The estimated price range for this project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.&nbsp; Interested Contractors can download the Request for Proposal package from Internet Site <a href="http://www.fbo.gov/"><span style="COLOR: #05509e">www.fbo.gov</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>on November 24, 2009.&nbsp; The due date for proposals will be on January 12, 2010 at 4:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time. &nbsp; Requests made by telephone, fax or e-mail will not be honored.&nbsp; The point of contact is Kim M.

<p>This contract was awarded competitively.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION.  FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. DUNS 007113228.  The modification addresses the following work:

These funds are to support independent and merit reviewers for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) 48C Tax Credit Applications. Reviews will be conducted for evaluating and selecting applications in response to IRS Notice 2009-72 titled “Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit”.  

The action is other than fixed price because work assigned to the Sandia Corporation through the issuance of Work Authorizations (WAs) is pursuant to the terms and conditions of their prime management and operating contract awarded under as a cost reimbursement type contract due to the uncertainties in contract performance.  Cost cannot be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract as the exact nature and duration of the work is uncertain.  The use of a separate fixed price award to Sandia Corporation for the WA is inappropriate because this is issued under an existing cost reimbursable contract.  Sandia was selected by the Department of Energy (DOE) to participate in this ARRA work due to the expertise at Sandia National Laboratories in the subject matter.  The funds will ensure the best selection of grantees proposing the best approach in support of new, expanded or re-equipped domestic manufacturing facilities with a goal of growing the domestic manufacturing industrial base with clean energy, sustainable economic growth, job creation, and reduced generation of greenhouse emissions.  The work falls within the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy which is covered by the prime contract Statement of Work, paragraph 3.3, entitled “Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy” that states: “The Contractor shall provide research, design and manufacturing capabilities for solar electric technologies (solar thermal and photovoltaic), wind energy, geothermal energy systems, industrial and transportation applications, fossil energy programs, electric power systems, hydrogen power technologies and battery systems for utilities and transportation.”  

NOTE:  This action is awarded under prime contract modification no. A361 that recognizes Work Authorization no. 100254-20758-10 issued under Management and Operating Contract number DE-AC04-94AL85000.  This action is funded by Recovery Act dollars.
