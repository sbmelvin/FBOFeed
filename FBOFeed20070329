<DESC>SOLICITATION NO. 301817Q173 PROJECT TITLE:  Tree Removal at Hegland Waterfowl Production Area (WPA) in Lac Qui Parle County PROJECT LOCATION:   U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service 	Morris Wetland Management District			      	Morris, Minnesota PROJECT DESCRIPTION:   Take down all trees as marked on attached map.  Removal is to be accomplished only via mechanical means such as shearing or otherwise cutting the trees and then chipping them and/or moving them into designated on-site slash piles.  If chipped, the resulting material may be removed off site or spread to a depth of no greater than four inches.   The slash piles must be stacked at least 50 feet from the edge of the water in a manner to allow for consumption by fire and cannot be stacked to heights greater than thirty feet (30') nor larger than a hundred feet (100') in length or width.  Individual slash piles will not consist of less than ten (10) trees and must be at least 300 feet from the roads on the west and south parts of the unit.    The Government will conduct the slash pile burning. All remaining stumps must be cut or otherwise mechanically reduced to a height of less than six inches (6") and each stump greater than 4" in diameter must be promptly treated with Garlon 3A or Roundup in accordance with manufacturer recommendations. Brush shall be hydro-axed or otherwise mowed to near ground level.  Residue shall be spread out evenly to a depth of no more than six inches (6"). Absolutely no material should be left in the wetlands scattered throughout the cutting area.   Period of Performance:  Work will be performed between July 15 and March 15 and only when surface soils are dry or frozen.  Once commenced, the work should proceed with due diligence.  Work should not be performed during the firearms deer season.  It is anticipated that this job will be completed by October 1, 2007 but the period of performance may be extended due to extenuating circumstances. Description of the area and types of trees:  The attached map shows the approximate location of the trees that are to be removed.  The site has been divided into two areas.  The first area is approximately 17 acres and the second is approximately 21 acres.  Total approximate acreage for the two areas is 38 acres.  Contractor is responsible for verifying acreages prior to submission of bids.  Bids should be submitted for each of the two areas and awarding of bids will depend on the amount of funding available.  The dominant species is buckthorn with some Russian olive, cottonwood, and other species mixed in as well.  While there is little commercial value to these trees, contractor may harvest any of it for personal use or sale and the Government will lay no claim for title or reimbursement there from. (Use of biomass is encouraged but not required under this contract) In general, these sites are normally fairly dry however there are scattered wet spots located throughout the site. A larger wetland also bisects the two sites as shown on the map.  There are both surface and partially buried rocks present so care should be taken with equipment to minimize damage.  Surrounding grasslands and remaining grasslands within the tree area are native prairie and these prairie areas should not be excavated or disturbed below the upper soil layer.   ESTIMATED MAGNITUDE:  The magnitude of this requirement in terms of physical characteristics and estimated price range is between $25,000 and $100,000. SOCIOECONOMIC PROGRAMS:  This procurement shall be awarded as a Firm Fixed Priced Service Contract.  For information purposes, the North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 113110, Forrestry and Logging, with a size standard of $6.5 million.   This Announcement is 100% Set-Aside for Small Business.   The RFQ Solicitation Package will be available via electronic commerce at http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about April 13, 2007.

<DESC>This Presolicitation Notice is issued for the procurement of a highly qualified construction contractor to perform all the services related to the Façade Repair and Slate Roof Replacement of the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse located at 271 Cadman Plaza East, Brooklyn, NY.  The selected construction contractor will be required to supply all labor, materials and supervision to perform the complete services as will be required by the resultant contract. 

The Estimated Construction Cost Ranges from $45,000,000 to $55,000,000.

The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse is an historic structure located in the Civic Center of the Borough of Brooklyn, New York.  It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a New York City Landmark. The 575,000 gross square foot building occupies an entire city block, fronting on Cadman Plaza, a major public space around which many federal, state and municipal buildings are organized.  The building houses the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the Office of the U.S. Trustee, the U.S. Attorney and the U.S. Postal Service.  Originally constructed as a Post Office and Courthouse in 1892, the building was enlarged in 1933.  The earlier, four-story (plus attic) structure that occupies the southern end of the site was designed by Mifflin Bell, then Supervising Architect of the Treasury, and is Romanesque Revival in style.  The exterior facades are built of granite-faced masonry bearing walls, embellished with carved ornament, dormers and turrets.  The eight-story 1933 addition that occupies the balance of the site was undertaken under the direction of James Wetmore, Acting Supervising Architect of the Treasury.  In designing the addition, great effort was made to emulate the appearance of the 1892 structure.  While many architectural details are shared by both structures, the 1933 structure incorporated the use of terra cotta cladding secured directly to masonry walls with ferrous anchors, in lieu of granite, above the first floor.  Above this level, the use of granite was limited to the stonework surrounding the second floor windows.

This project will involve the replacement of nearly all the deteriorated terra cotta cladding on the facades of the 1933 structure with new terra cotta or approved alternate materials, restoration of all existing granite cladding on both buildings, and replacement of the entire slate mansard roofing system on both structures.   The entire complex will remain fully occupied throughout the construction period.  The design will follow the Secretary of Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and Historic Building Preservation Plan (HBPP) guidance, respecting the historic character of the building while accomplishing the project requirements to correct the deficiencies in the exterior envelope of the building and to preclude further façade deterioration and damage to the structure and the recently renovated historic interior.

The Scope of Work will include, but may not necessarily be limited to, the following work items:

•	Replacement of nearly all of the existing deteriorated terra cotta cladding with new terra cotta or approved alternate materials and new non-ferrous supports and anchorage devices on the facades, dormers and light well of the 1933 structure.
•	Retention, repair, restoration, re-pointing and cleaning of existing terra cotta at window surrounds on the facades, dormers and light well of the 1933 structure wherever possible.
•	Repair, restoration, cleaning, and re-pointing of the existing granite cladding on the facades of both the 1892 and 1933 structures.
•	Replacement of the entire slate roofing system on both structures, including the tower on the 1892 building,  to match the appearance and character of the existing slate roof, including associated wood decking and lead coated copper gutters, gutter boxes, flashing, valleys and ridges.
•	Installation of an access and fall protection/prevention system in compliance with all applicable OSHA regulations at the slate mansard roof on both structures to facilitate periodic maintenance of perimeter gutters and drains. 
•	Hazardous materials investigation and abatement associated with the above work items.

The Government will solicit proposals under a source selection process for Construction Contractors.  Selection will be based on a combination of technical and price factors that provide the best value to the Government. The Government will select up to three (3) Construction Contractors to provide pre-construction services.  The Construction Contractors will provide design phase consultations evaluating costs, schedule, alternative design implications, building systems, construction materials and constructability.  At the conclusion of the Bid Phase, one (1) of the Construction Contractors will be selected to provide construction services.  The selected Construction Contractor will serve as the General Contractor during construction, contracting directly with subcontractors.  Award of this contract will be contingent upon availability of funds. 

Additional information for this procurement will be provided in a synopsis of FedBizOpps.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency intends to enter into negotiations with Able Communications Technology Corporation, 14 Pidgeon Hill Drive, Sterling, VA, a small veteran owned business, for engineering and help desk support for the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) military standards (i.e. MIL-STD-188-181C, -182B and –183B also known as the Integrated Waveform (IW)).

The UHF SATCOM system provides the US Department of Defense (DOD) critical beyond line-of-sight communications for tactical and special forces operations.  UHF SATCOM is the only commercial or military system that can operate under all weather conditions and cover.  However, the currently implemented UHF SATCOM Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) waveforms are no longer technologically current, efficient, and effective to fulfill the UHF SATCOM user operational requirements.  As part of its Charter, DISA has revised the UHF SATCOM standards to the more technologically capable Integrated Waveform standards, which have the potential of meeting a larger number of critically needed operational requirements. To achieve the IW benefits for current operations, DOD has selected a number of user terminal types to be upgraded to IW on a priority basis.  DISA has contracted with those selected terminal vendors to develop software changes that will implement IW in their products.  

The intended contract is to assist the DISA Narrowband Project Office in the execution of the development, testing, and fielding of the IW capability.  The contractor will assist the government in:

a.  Analyzing and performing any IW waveform modifications that may be needed to support the implementation of IW into the fielded software programmable radios/terminals.
b.  Developing test plans and procedures for the IW certification testing at the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC).
c.  Designing and fabricating IW channel controller tools for use by the radio/terminal vendors during the IW software development and JITC certification.
d.  Evaluating and assessing proposed software designs by the radio vendors to implement IW. 
e.  Loading and testing of the developed IW software in the radios/terminals.
f.  Assessing software installation and radio operating procedures for the IW software.
g.  Providing help desk support to radio users during initial fielding of the software.
h.  Assisting in the development and fielding of the IW software in the UHF SATCOM radios/terminals.

Able Communications is the only known source capable of completing this work without significant delay and additional cost to the program.  RFP HC1047-07-R-0013 will be issued for a base year and four option years for approximately 19,425 hours per year.  The anticipated award is fourth quarter FY07.  See Notes 1 and 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency intends to enter into negotiations with Xenotran Corporation, 513 Progress Drive, Linthicum Heights, MD, for software development and engineering services in support of the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) military standards.  The software will support the implementation, integration, and testing of the Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB) waveform.  The CIB is the latest set of the approved UHF SATCOM military standards MIL-STD-188-181C, -182B, -183B and MIL-STD-188-186, which support the requirements of the Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS).  This effort will also develop and implement software defined radio that can serve as a Master Channel Controller for transmission of the System Forward Orderwire (SFOW) and Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) Forward Orderwire (FOW) (DFOW) as defined in MIL STD 188 183B and as a DAMA Terminal.  The software defined radio will also contain a modulator/demodulator as defined in MIL-STD-188-181C.  The currently implemented UHF SATCOM Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) waveforms (MIL-STD-188-181B, -182A and –183A) needed updating to provide for a technologically current, efficient, and effective approach to fulfill the IBS operational requirements.  As required by DOD 4120.24-M “Defense Standardization Program,” DISA has revised the UHF SATCOM standards to be consistent with user needs and evolving technology.  The revised UHF SATCOM standards (MIL-STD-188-181C, -182B and –183B) are known as the integrated waveform (IW).  In addition, DISA is developing a unique IBS Data Control layer which will condition and control the IBS report flow over UHF SATCOM or other communications media.  The intended contract is to assist the DISA Narrowband Project Office in the development and testing of a CIB compliant data control layer software. In addition, the intended contract will develop a software defined radio which will be used as a test tool and aid in the upgrade of user terminals to IW.  Xenotran Corporation is the only company able to meet the requirement without significant delay and additional cost to the program.  RFP No. HC1047-07-R-0014 is expected to be released on/about 16 April 2007 for a base year and four options.  Estimated level of effort is 19,980 hours per year.  Contract award is expected during fourth quarter FY07.   See Notes 1 and 22.

<DESC>This activity will work on building the trade and business enabling environment in Haiti by providing support to the Government of Haiti and private sector associations.  The work carried out under this activity will support the Government's efforts to engage internationally on trade policy and increase the private sector's capacity to advocate on trade and investment issues.  It will build on on-going USAID projects in the areas of association development and maritime security, as well as on the important USAID initiative underway to facilitate investment in Haiti.  Increased public-private dialogue will be a key element to I-TRADE.  This activity will be expected to complement other USAID activities that seek to enhance production and the development of market value chains by addressing the internal and external barriers to trade.

The performance-based Contract to be awarded will aim to increase trade opportunities as well as the capacity of Haitians to take advantage of these opportunities through access to investment and trade information. As a result, USAID expects to see clear linkages between the I-TRADE project and related USAID development projects in the area of market development, and the resulting contribution to the number of Haitians involved in sustainable economic activities.

<DESC>DESC:  NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT TO  M. I. C. Industries Inc. to provide the items listed below UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.501(a)(1). M. I. C. Industries, Inc., 11911 Freedom Drive, Reston, Virginia 20190 will be awarded a Firm-Fixed Price contract.  The approximate dollar value of the award is under $200,000.  The items to be purchased are as follows:  One (1) ea Model 75 Trailer (now officially called the MIC 75 Construction Support Unit (CSU) patented by M.I.C. Industries, which comes with a self-contained transportable workshop and tool security storage complete with tools and equipment for use with the M.I.C. patented Ultimate Building Machine (UBM) Construction System.  The M.I.C. 75 Trailer will provide forward combat skills expertise to the Engineer Operations Company in their role in combating the Global War On Terrorism.  The activity’s primary mission is to construct KSPANS while on deployment.  These are considered temporary structures with a life span of at least 10 years.  They are superior to wood frame structures in the desert and provide a cleaner and more maintenance free environment bett!  er suited for aircraft maintenance or medical usage than wood frame buildings.  The M.I.C. 75 Trailer works in conjunction with the Ultimate Building Machine (UBM) which is also manufactured by M.I.C Industries (they own the patent) that is currently being used to build KSPAN structures in Iraq.  Therefore, there is an urgent need to train with the same exact equipment to prepare the Marines for future deployments to Iraq which would require them to construct additional KSPAN structures in support of the Aviation Combat Element’s mission. the M.I.C. Trailer comes with a self –contained transportable workshop and tool security storage complete with tools and equipment for use on the M.I.C. patented UBM construction system.  To attempt to procure the myriad construction inventory items that are inclusive to the M.I.C. Construction Support Unit is not cost effective nor a timely consideration due to the urgency of the MWSS 372 requirement to train their Marines and deploy in s!  upport of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  MIC Industries makes the MIC-75 tr ailer.  This is a complete system and not a collection of tools on a trailer.  Some of the major items included in the trailer are:  a metal break (bends flat sheet metal that makes K-Span bays), 2 Plasma cutters (One for panels and one for angle iron), Air Compressor (approximately 3 hp), heaters/fans for ventilation when working Hazmat or polyurethane, etc., survey gear, welding machine with 10kw generator, rebar bender, UBM specific repair tools, Workbench with vice and arbor press, travel gates with nets, etc.  Includes galvanized steel, Panel Seaming Devices and a Pre-Seamer collateral equipment.  It is a configured and organized unit and mobile workshop.  All items are secured, bolted, and double locked for ease of mobility, use, and transport.  Each door has a detailed packing list for ease of use.  With all items being secured it is also much safer than if we attempt to configure this unit ourselves.   This Notice of Intent is not a request for Expressions of Interest (EOIs), proposals or quotations.  No solicitation document exists and no telephone inquiries will be accepted.  No contract award will be made on the basis of EOIs, proposals or quotations received in response to this notice.   This purchase will be under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized under FAR 6.302-1.  The anticipated award date is 5 April 2007.  Point of contact for this purchase is Ronnie Bierner at (760) 725 3914 or e-mail ronnie.d.bierner@usmc.mil.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is soliciting white papers and full proposals describing innovative technology concepts to provide Low Cost Swimmer Detection and Identification.  Concepts are required that will detect and initially classify a swimmer or diver who has entered a specific zone around an asset to be protected. The environment of interest is primarily expeditionary, focusing on the waters surrounding and approaches to individual Navy ships that are temporarily berthed at ports and anchorages in world wide locations.  The targets include free swimmers, open and closed circuit divers, and divers aided by Diver Propulsion Vehicles (DPVs). Concepts may range from short range sensor technologies suitable for barriers to longer range active systems, but should be novel or clearly competitive in terms of the size, weight, and cost considerations that may be associated with future organic or expeditionary concepts of operation for swimmer detection. The effort will include basic concept investigations and experiments leading to the development of hardware for a demonstration of the concepts in a realistic environment.  The intention is to initiate new research efforts in FY 2008 with candidate concepts demonstrated in FY 2010 or earlier.

<SUBJECT>D -- Accelerating Public Health Situational Awareness Through Health Information Exchanges
<SOLNBR>ToBeDetermined
<ARCHDATE>05152007
<CONTACT>Vivian Hubbs, Contract Specialist, Phone (770) 488-2647, Fax (770) 488-2670, Email VHubbs@cdc.gov - Lorenzo Falgiano, Contract Specialist, Phone (770) 488-2629, Fax (770) 488-2670, Email ljf5@cdc.gov
<DESC>The National Center for Public Health Informatics (NCPHI) in the Coordinating Center for Health Information and Service (CCHIS) in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), intends to compete a requirement for services and supplies to establish and manage or enhance existing Health Information Exchanges (HIE) to exchange information between clinical care and public health to support public health situational awareness.  It is anticipated that more than one cost reimbursement development type contract will be awarded for a 5-year period with performance beginning on or about August 31, 2007.  HIE and Regional Health Information Organization (RHIO) will be referred to as "HIE" throughout this document.     

Data to support the nation's public health needs increasingly can be derived from electronic health systems that support clinical care.   Local health systems, often funded by grants from state or federal agencies, are now forming organizations to actuate the exchange of health data among participating entities.  The focus of these HIEs has mostly been on clinical health information exchange with limited emphasis on biosurveillance or simultaneous reporting to local and state public health departments.  Additional investment in the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN) is needed to support HIE services for early detection and rapid response to potentially catastrophic infectious disease outbreaks and other public health emergencies.  

Given the need to network systems, CDC has leveraged the BioSense program to quickly improve the nation's capabilities for real-time biosurveillance and health situational awareness.  Since inception, BioSense has focused on harmonizing data at the hospital and hospital system level for reporting to CDC with simultaneous reporting to state and local health departments.   This requirement accelerates BioSense connectivity by supporting reporting of  ambulatory care and emergency department visit, utilization and lab result data from electronically enabled health care delivery and public health systems  to an HIE for harmonization, exchange, and event detection.  

Successful HIEs will be required to participate in the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN) process (meetings, specification development and interoperability testing) to be established in a separate NHIN request for proposals to be published spring 2007. Successful HIEs will also need to use the relevant data and technical standards identified by the Health Information Technology and Standards Panel (HITSP) Interoperability Specifications for the fulfillment of this activity.  

Data to support early detection, situational awareness, and rapid response management will be shared (appropriately anonymized and in standard format) with authorized Public Health Agencies and care delivery communities.  Public health emergencies with high-risk of impact on morbidity and mortality such as season influenza, and other infectious diseases, will be of particular focus.  
 
The primary goal of this five-year effort is to facilitate innovations or proof-of-concept in public health within  HIEs with the goals of supporting public health emergencies, enhancing biosurveillance capabilities, and field-testing  the Minimum Data Set accepted by American Health Information Community (AHIC).  Support will be provided for up to 15 HIEs to establish or enhance public health use of clinical and other health information for purposes of biosurveillance and outbreak detection.  Awards will be made to established HIEs to identify innovations to improve the operation of information technology systems, facilitate the secure exchange of data and information, and train personnel to enhance the operation of the system to integrate public health reporting into the HIE.  Awards will also be made to less established HIEs to implement existing technology, policy, and governance rules to integrate public health into the HIE (proof-of-concept).  

The contractor's primary goal will be to improve public health situational awareness capability through an interoperable network of systems to share data and information to enhance early detection, rapid response to, and management of public health emergencies.  This typically involves collaboration with state, local, and tribal public health officials (or regional representation), regional clinical care and public health care providers, and staff to provide technical and administrative services for  project planning and logistics, training and communications, data collection, management and analysis, data privacy and security, data sharing agreements and related support activities.   

Responses by Facsimile (Fax) will not be accepted. All vendors/prospective contractors must be registered with the Central Contractors Registration (www.ccr.gov) prior to award date. If not registered or active by that date, vendor proposals will be considered non-responsive.  It is anticipated that a solicitation for this requirement will be posted to FedBizopps on or after 4/16/2007.

Inquiries may be sent to the attention of the Contracting Officer:  Vivian S. Hubbs, Phone 770-488-2647, email VHubbs@cdc.gov.  If the Contracting Officer isn't available, please contact the Team Leader, Lorenzo Falgiano.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>R--COST ANALYSIS STUDY FOR BUILDING 10 AT PARRIS ISLAND MCRD SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT
<SOLNBR>W912DW-07-Q-0043
<RESPDATE>040207
<ARCHDATE>06012007
<CONTACT>Vincent Daniels, 206-764-3572
<DESC>Statement of Work The Cost Analysis Study for Building 10 At Parris Island MCRD Rev. 9-21-2006 I. 	Background:   Building 10 is a 28,384 square foot, two-story structure, rectangular in plan, with a one-story square addition at the front side, built on a brick foundation.  The exterior walls are constructed of brick laid in an English bond.  The pitched gable roof ov er the main rectangle is covered with composition shingles.  There are six large round vents at the ridge of the roof.  The roof over the single story addition is flat.  A corbelled brick band runs up the outer edges of the gable, and bands the building at  the cornice level, continuing across the gable.  Centered within each of the gables is a circle window that has been bricked in, but still retains the brick voussoirs and limestone keystones.  Down both sides of the building are recessed panels defined by  corbelled brick, creating the appearance of brick pilasters between sets of windows.  Fenestration is symmetrical.  The primary entrance, located at the north end of the building, is composed of two single glass doors with metal frames and single lite tra nsoms, set under an aluminum overhang suspended from the face of the building by steel cables.  On either side of the building are loading docks covered with corrugated metal shed roofs.  Secondary entrances include overhead garage doors on the loading doc ks, and a single doors made of either wood or steel.  The windows on the first floor have all been bricked over and some have small vents inserted in them, but the ghosts of the original round top windows remain.  The second story windows have been replace d with round top double hung windows of the same shape and size as the originals, but with dark brown metal frames.  The gutters and downspouts appear to be of cast iron. II.  History And Significance: Building 10 was constructed in 1897 and presently serves as an administration building for disbursing.  It was one of the first permanent structures constructed at Parris Island, which was originally established as the United States Naval Station, Port Roy al, South Carolina. The site of the Naval Station at Parris Island was chosen because of its sheltered location and deep water access.  Congress made an initial appropriation for the construction of permanent structures in late 1882 and additional appropri ations were made during the 1880s and 1890s. This building is located in the Depot's Historic District, which includes some of the oldest buildings at Parris Island.  The district centers around the dry dock and buildings constructed during the initial est ablishment of the naval station through World War I. Building 10 is a contributing element of the Depot's Historic District.  The building has national significance because it and the other naval station buildings were the first modern, military, industrial structures in South Carolina and among the first in  the United States. It is also significant to national, state and local history due to it association with Congressman Robert Smalls, the Beaufort born slave who served with the Union military and after the war became the area's US Congressman and helped e stablish the naval station on Parris Island. The building is also associated with important Marine Corps leaders such as A. A.  Vandegrift, J. C. Smith, A. A. Cunningham and R. S. Geiger who attended officer candidates school in the building.  This buildin g is significant in that it retains integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship and feeling; and for its association with events that have made significant contributions to the broad patterns of our history (the early-development of the Marine Corps at Parris Island). III   Purpose of the Study:   The purpose of this study is to examine the costs demolition vs two rehabilitation treatments with an emphasis on preservation and sustainability.  This study will compare the costs of maintaining several different treatment action, including for comparative and analytical of rehabilitation, leasing and new construction.  The report will acknowledge that decisions to replaces, demolish, or maintain building 10 within the context of present and future needs at Parris Island MCRD. IV   Scope of the Study: 	A.  Basic Study Task 1 and 2. 	Task 1. -  Drawings and Documents Review and Feasibility Analysis:   The Consultant shall review existing documents, including available as-built drawings, prior field investigation reports and studies, and other pertinent data provided in analyzing the feasibility of renovating the buildings for office space and meeting cu rrent seismic codes and the DOD Minimum Antiterrorism (ATFP) Standards for Buildings.  The purpose of the task is to review the past studies and evaluate date, assumptions, techniques and cost estimates.  Note:  MCRD Parris Island has previously had two different A-E firms perform a analysis for the potential rehabilitation and renovation of building 10 from a warehouse and administration space to administrative space.  The previous studies were not based o n the same assumptions and do not include all encompassing cost estimates.   Task 2. - Field Inspection.   The Consultant shall conduct field investigations to verify data on as-built drawings and to determine/verify existing information and conditions using the background data in Task 1.  The Consultant will inspection the exterior and interior of the structur e to determine its physical condition, remaining historic fabric, and past alterations or repairs that have damaged historical or functional integrity.  The exterior inspection should include roofs and related appurtenances, chimneys, gutters and downspout s, exterior walls, windows and doors, architectural trim, hardware, and related site and landscape features that directly affect the structure.  The interior inspection should include the structural system, floors, fireplaces, mantles and hearths, architec tural woodwork, and trim. The Consultant will contact the Museum Curator, Mr. Stephen R. Wise, Ph.D, Phone: (843) 228-3765; E-mail: stephen.Wise@usmc.mil., Ten (10) days prior to any site visit so that all arrangement can be made.            Task -3  Comparison of Treatment Alternatives Actions For Building 10 The Contractor shall develop a list of recommended treatment alternatives' actions that will assist managers and maintenance supervisors in the decision making process concerning the operation and maintenance of building 10.  The recommendation treatment s hall address materials, maintenance, management procedures that improve the understanding of sustainable solutions of historic preservation.   A.  Do Nothing Treatment Under the treatment building 10 would remain without any changes to function or fabric. Building 10 would remain essentially empty with perhaps a minimal occupation of a few areas.  Building 10 would remain functioning as the office space on the first floor and storage space on the upper floors. Continuing maintenance would be required and wo uld necessarily need to increase as the deterioration which the  both buildings are  is now experiencing worsens.  The materials and systems (mechanical and electrical) of both buildings, which are currently in need of extensive repair, would continue to d eteriorate leading eventually to some failure compromising life safety. B.  Demolition Action This action would involve the complete removal of the building leaving the site bare with some site restoration.  There is asbestos in the building which would require proper removal and disposal as well as other hazardous materials.  The demolition of the  foundations and reconfiguring of the underground mechanical systems would involve excavation that might confront issues of contaminated soils.  The Section 106 processes (including full consultation with the South Carolina State Historic Preservation Offi ce (SCSHPO) and other  interested parties) under this treatment would be requirement and time consuming than other options, requiring mitigation in the form of complete documentation before demolition could occur.  Building 10 was constructed over a coal yard and storage shed s o probability of contaminates would be high. C. Mothballing Treatment This treatment would encapsulate the buildings, leaving them it unoccupied and in stasis pending future rehabilitation or other treatment.  The work involved would be the sealing of the exterior envelope to eliminate weather intrusion.  This would mean rep airing the roofs to prevent leaks, covering the windows and doors, and installation of a climate control system that would regulate the interior temperature and humidity to prevent deterioration.  Periodic inspections and regular maintenance would be requi red also.  There would be Section 106 processes (including full consultation with the SCSHPO and other interested parties) required for this treatment. D. Partial Rehabilitation Treatment This treatment involves partial rehabilitation of the first floor of the structures including demolition of interiors walls, seismic upgrade, repair of deteriorated exteriors, and installation of completely new interior systems.   The treatment should not exceed 50% of the replacement cost of the building therefore rehabilitation would not be concerned a major investment per ATFP standards.  A new scope of work would be prepared to meet the requirements for all building codes, life-safety and hurricane stan dards.   Section 106 processes would be necessary for this treatment. E. Complete Rehabilitation Treatment This treatment involves complete (both floors) rehabilitation of the structures including demolition of interiors walls, seismic upgrade, repair of deteriorated exteriors, and installation of completely new interior systems.  A new scope of work would be p repared to meet the requirements for all building codes, life-safety code, hurricane and ATFP standards.  Section 106 processes (including full consultation with the SCSHPO and other interested parties) would be necessary for this treatment. F. New Construction This action would construct a primary administration facility approximatively 28,384 square foot. The buildings will be a two-story rectangular structure in plan, constructed of load-bearing masonry and steel structural elements.  The facility will include  sustainable design features to the greatest extent possible, including the use of a low slope roof system and natural lighting.  Supporting facility should include utilities; electric service; security and street lighting; fire protection and alarm system s; paving, sidewalks, curbs and gutters; storm and sanitary sewers; information systems; and site improvements. Anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP) measures will include building setback distances, landscaping, and security lighting. V.  Comparison of Cost  vs Alternatives Actions For Building 10 a) 	The Cost of Rehabilitation vs The Cost of New Construction plus demolition. The Contractor shall prepare a brief comparison between the cost Rehabilitation of Building 10 vs New Construction.  The comparison can be summarized for this requirement.  The analysis should concern the cost of demolition and removing a contaminate mater ials beyond the five foot line. This analysis should provide some detail example showing partial rehabilitation treatments and a complete rehabilitation treatments report.  b)  The Cost of Rehabilitation vs The Cost of Leasing a Rehabilitation Building. The Contractor shall prepare a brief comparison between the cost Rehabilitation of Building 10 vs Leasing part or all of the rehabilitated building for administration space or for other future space requirements.  The leasing concept would provide administ ration space for uses such as space for a privatization center.  Privatization Contractors would locate there day to day operations offic es in the center.  The funds returned for from the lease could go to support other programs on the installation.   VI.  General Requirements.  	a.  General.  The Contractor shall develop a study to meet the requirements identified in the SOW and study outline.  Contractor shall provide the professional quality service, technical accuracy, and the coordination of all phases of the study. 	   b.

The research design should define the objectiv es of the proposed work, provide a brief description of the methods used to obtain the information needed to attain the objectives, and a short description of expected results. 	(4)     Recommended Treatment Action:  The Consultant shall prepare recommended treatment action for the facility based on standards and criteria.   Also provide schematic design and layout of any added information such as lateral force resisting, histori c elements that should be retained or any other items that may be required in order to reduce potential loss of life and property.  The Consultant will provide a cost estimate for each treatment action and a more detail cost estimate for the recommended tr eatment.  (To include labor and materials required to accomplish treatment action.)  	(5)    Final Report:  The Contractor shall participate in a one (1) day 90% final review conference at Parris Island, SC.  Contractor personnel shall include the project manager and any other appropriate study representatives.

A Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will result from this solicitation, including profit, overhead and hourly rates for anticipated disciplines and for use in negotiating FFP task orders.  A supplemental architect-engineer lookup table for pricing task orders for projects with an estimated construction cost of less than $2,000,000 will be included in the contract.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to distribute the Questions and Answers which were discussed at Industry Day held at China Lake, CA on 20 March 2007. Also enclosed as an attachment to this notice is the Attendees Listing.  Ultra Endurance UAV Heavy-Fuel Engine Development Industry Day - 20 March 2007 N68936-07-R-0020 - Ultra Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UE-UAV) Questions and Answers  1.	Q: 	There seems to be some confusion in the response date for the white paper. It's currently posted as 23 April, but the brief says 16 April. Which is correct?  	A:	The correct date is 16 April.  23 April was a typographical error. See Table 5.1 – Significant Dates and Times, in the original synopsis. This date was also corrected in amendment 1 to the synopsis dated 7 March 2007. 2.	Q:	Why is the tolerance on AC power set at .75 kw. If we could generate more, would that be acceptable. 	A:	Yes, you can produce more, but the requirement is for .75 kw, while also producing 5 horsepower at the propeller shaft. 3.	Q:	Also, shouldn't that be a minimum of 9 horse power? You’d accept something higher, right? 	A:	Yes. At full power the engine must produce a minimum of 8.5 (nominal 9 SHP) propeller-shaft horsepower. 4.	Q: 	Are the dwell time figures based on MSL standard? 	A:	There are no dwell time requirements. However, performance parameters will be corrected to Sea Level. 5.	Q:	I assume the ideal engine would propel the airframe to 15,000 to 16,000 feet altitude. 	A:	The objective is 15,000 feet. 6.	Q:	What is included in the propulsion system? 	A:	This information is specified in the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). 7.	Q:	You're looking for speeds of 2500 to 5000 RPM? 	A:	The BAA suggests an RPM range. We're really looking for a typical RPM range at 5 propeller-shaft horsepower?   8.	Q:	Why do you specify AC power? 	A:	That's what we felt would be best. But we’re willing to listen if you think DC power would be better. Just be sure to make the point and back it up in your white paper. 9.	Q:	Will the AC power be conditioned to something else? 	A:	Yes, by the aircraft. 10.	Q:	 The AC power generation components must be included in the total engine weight? 	A:	Yes. 11.	Q:	Will differences be considered in the white paper.  For example, does the engine have to be the weight specified or if a heavier engine is proposed that will fly longer, can that be considered? 	A:	Yes, if it is reasonably similar and the efficiency is increased. 12.	Q:	The pusher propeller is the most likely? 	A: 	Most likely. 13.	Q:	What is the propeller size and RPM of the existing Aerolight aircraft? 	A:	Two-blade, 22" propeller at 3600-7000 RPM. The propeller can be 2- or 3-blade and the RPM can vary. 14.	Q:	If we are testing in the 2500 to 5000 RPM range, we may need larger propellers to move air. 	A:	The performance specifications will be validated during ground testing. If a propeller change is required for aircraft integration, this is allowed as long as it provides sufficient thrust for flight. 15.	Q:	Will airframes be available for form, fit, and function checks? 	A:	Yes, some access will be provided later in the program.  16.	Q:	What is the current engine in the Aerolight? 	A:	It is the Q100M from Quadra Aerrow.  With the generator, it weights 12 lbs. 17.	Q:	Are these commercially available airframes? 	A:	Yes. These are manufactured by Aeronautics Defense Systems Ltd (Isreali). There is more information available on the web (see URL below). The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) and Shephard have database information.   http://www.aeronautics-sys.com/Index.asp?CategoryID=62&ArticleID=34&Page=1 18.	Q:	If we have a representative aircraft that demonstrates the capabilities of our engine, can we use it and accelerate the program? 	A:	Yes, if it is close, we will take a look at it.  19.	Q:	You say both of these airframes are at Webster Field? 	A:	Yes. Webster Field is near Patuxent River, MD.  20.	Q:	What is required cruising speed? 	A:	The requirement is for the aircraft to be able to fly, and the minimum airspeed will be specified in the Interface Control Document. 21.	Q:	What is the required thrust? 	A:	None is specified, but if you develop the required horsepower to keep it in the air, that will be sufficient. 22.	Q:	After the white papers are submitted by 16 April, when will you send out invitations for a full proposal? 	A:	The goal is to send a letter of response within 7 days. This time could be longer depending on the number of white papers received for evaluation.  If an e-mail address is provided, the response will be sent by e-mail. 23.	Q:	Phase I and II will be cost plus fixed fee?  	A:	The entire contract will be cost plus fixed fee. You need to cost each phase separately, but all phases will be evaluated together as a whole. 24.	Q:	The white paper is limited to 15 pages. Does that include text, pictures, graphs, and tables, or just text? 	A:	That includes everything, so don't overpopulate with pictures. Text is important. The table of contents and any resumes will not be counted in the 15 pages. 25.	Q:	Will a list of Industry Day attendees be provided on FEDBIZOPS?   	A:	Yes. This listing is enclosed as an attachment to this amendment notice.  26.	Q:	Does the cost in the white paper have to be our final cost? 	A:	No. It can be a rough order-of-magnitude estimate. 27.	Q:	Will you accept the white paper as an e-mail? 	A:	The BAA specifies it must be a hardcopy. 28.	Q:	Since taxes are not due until 17 April, is 16 April a Federal holiday?   		A:	No 29.	Q:	The electrical power generated must be .75 kw. Do you care what frequency? 	A:	No. 30.	Q:	In the BAA 1.4.1.2, number 11, lists parts as “A-F,” then we’re asked to provide as "1-6." 	A:	That was a typographical error that didn't get corrected. The alphas should correlate to the numerical listing. (i.e.: A=1, B=2, etc). 31.	Q:	Does "producibility" mean you're looking for a full-production manufacturing plan? A:	No. We're looking to see if you've thought through the issues to produce the product and manufacture the engine in a reasonable way and how that will take place.  We ask that you have an idea of how the engine will be produced. 32.	Q:	You're not looking for an explanation of how it can be produced somewhere else? 	A:	We're not asking for that kind of detail. 33. Q: Do you want the cost associated with production factored in to our cost proposal? 	A:	This is not a requirement. We do not have a producibility cost goal. We will want a rough order-of-magnitude cost estimate in your producibility plan using a baseline of 200 engines. 34.	Q:	In Phase III you will want a deliverable. Do you have an idea of the number of engines? 	A:	At least one engine. 35.	Q:	Are you looking for onboard starting? 	A:	No, just an external method. 36.	Q:	How do you see this program relating to the Class 1 and Class 2 UAVs for the Army? 	A:	I can't speak to Army Future Combat Systems (FCS) nor guarantee similarities.  37.	Q:	Considering the different fuels in the goals, should all of them be considered as prime fuels? 	A:	The guidance we have says the warfighter wants all three. 38.	Q:	Are there cold-weather specifications for diesel fuel?   	A:	You are permitted to warm the fuels to the extent that it is reasonable that the expected airframe could accommodate such a feature. 39.	Q:	What is the start-up time? 	A:	Start-up time has not been specified.  40.	Q:	Subsystems and full systems will be tested at government facilities. Can you explain why subsystems would need to be tested by the government? 	A:	This may not be necessary, but we need to reserve the right to test subsystems.  41.	Q:	Do we need to include the cost of this testing in our cost budget? 	A:	The government will cover the facility and government personnel costs.  You will need to budget for your personnel and any other costs. 42. Q:	Should we include cost estimates for UAV integration? 	A	Yes, you should budget some. 43.	Q:	There is a noise signature qualification for 1500 ft AGL. Is there a dB specified? 	A:	No MIL-STDs or MIL-HDBKs exist to describe the quantification of the acoustic observability of aircraft.  A primer with pertinent references will be provided as soon as possible. 44.	Q: Is the noise requirement while running at 5 horsepower? 	A:	Yes. 45.	Q:	We will be working with subcontractors on this. Many of them consider their information highly proprietary.  Can we assure them that it will be well-protected? 	A:	Yes. Our technical evaluation team have all signed certificates of non-disclosures. Primes are required to evaluate their subcontractors to ensure that their price is fair and reasonable. Subcontractors can submit their cost information to support the proposal directly to Debra Zamarron, Contracts Specialist, separate from the Prime's package. The subcontractor proposals must be received by the proposal due date of 4 June 2007 by 2:00 PST. The prime contractor is responsible for ensuring the proposals are received by the due date and time.  46.	Q:	Are there any targets for per-hour run cost; any existing system data? 	  A:	We do not currently have cost goals.  We will find some baselines and provide them as soon as possible. 47.	Q:	Do we know which fuel will run in the vehicle? 	A:	Ground tests will run all three. One will be chosen for the flight test. You will be able to perform minimal changes to the engines to run the different fuels. We will be looking for the least amount of changes required for operators to use the different fuels. 48.	Q:	What are you looking for in the "complete test and validation" plan? 	A:	The plan should explain how you will identify and mitigate risks and show how the system will meet the aim, goals, and objectives of the program. 49.	Q:	What are our data rights? 	A:	If you use some things that you have already developed, those will remain yours. You should complete DFARS Clause 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data-Non-Commercial Items, and include it with your written proposal. 50.	Q:	Can we continue to develop core technologies at our own expense? 	A:	If you do, it will have to be handled very carefully. The government must get a return on its investment, so you must be careful to keep your IRAD money separate from the governments. 51.	Q:	Will engines be subjected to dyno tests or propeller tests? 	A:	Dyno with brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC).  52.	Q:	Is there a list or MIL SPEC on sea-worthy, non-corrosive materials that can be used?  	A:	There are guidelines and they will be provided as soon as possible. 53.	Q:	Do you know the test location for the dyno testing? 	A:	No, but we are working on that. 56.	Q:	Do we need to understand how to get flight clearance? 	A:	No. NAVAIR will require a flight clearance and the program will help with that. 57.	Q:	In the early part of the development we may have components that are not made of sea-worthy, non-corrosive materials that would not be in the final engine. 	A:	Phase III deliverable engines must meet the sea-worthy, non-corrosive materials requirement. 58.	Q:	Will the government help us find sources of JP-8 and JP-5? That can be hard to find. 	A: Yes, we'll assist with that. The diesel fuel is Number 2. NAICS Code = 541710 Place of Performance = N/A Set Aside  = N/A

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) seeks a SDVOSB with previous VA experience working on update existing Facility Condition Assessment (FCA) at each of the Medical Centers within a VISN.  The type of contract that is contemplated is a Firm fixed Price IDIQ AE with base and four one-year option.  A four-person team from the IDIQ A/Es office will visit each facility and gather necessary information for the updates from a combination of touring problem areas, engineering staff interviews and a quick study of the summaries of available VAMC reports (such as Asbestos Study summary, Life Safety Statement of Conditions and Seismic Report where applicable).  The existing FCA document will be used as a basis and edited during the visit. The four-person team shall be comprised of the following: Cost Estimator, Architect (to cover architectural and landscape architectural areas), Electrical Engineer (to cover electrical and transportation areas) and a Mechanical Engineer (to cover mechanical, plumbing & steam generation areas).  Structural problems, if any, should be addressed by the most qualified team member.  The IDIQ A/E should make every effort to utilize staff who participated in the firm’s previous VA FCA work to minimize the learning curve.  If you feel that you meet the SDVOSB qualification (must be prepared to provide proof) and have handled previous FCA work for VA, please email your qualification information about your firm alone with your name, phone number, and email address to:  Maria.pizarro@va.gov.

The Ambassador/DCM also shall have a leading role in evaluating the performance of the individual selected for the PEPFAR Coordinator position. Given that the PEPFAR Coordinator will be based in the US Embassy, time and attendance forms will be approved by the DCM. 

In accordance with USAID rules and regulations governing USAID programs and operations, USAID shall administer most administrative and human resource requirements of the PEPFAR Coordinator, including but not limited to, payroll, personnel files, managing the USAID contractor evaluation process, and any required formal approval of travel. The USAID RHAP Director will be the overall supervising officer for purposes of the USAID PSC contract with the PEPFAR Coordinator, with the understanding that the Ambassador/DCM shall provide day to day oversight of the individual selected.

E. Introduction and Background:  Swaziland is a non-focus but high priority country under the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (Emergency Plan), a unified USG initiative that from 2004 to 2008 is contributing globally to the fight against HIV/AIDS. 

Swaziland has the most severe national HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis crisis in the world, with an adult HIV prevalence rate at 42.6 percent. This unprecedented crisis requires an emergency response. Under the President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Emergency Plan), the United States Government (USG) employs strategies, principles and resources to assist Swaziland in containing, reversing, and mitigating the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 

The USG Emergency Plan program works closely with the Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland (GKOS) at all levels to address the policy, advocacy, financial, and technical challenges which constrain Swaziland’s ability to halt the epidemic. Close collaboration is a feature of the significant financial and technical support provided by USG. Additionally, the USG is by far the single largest and most significant contributor to Swaziland’s national response, both through the Emergency Plan and through the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM). USG Emergency Plan resources for Swaziland were $7 million dollars in FY 2006.   

The Emergency Plan in Swaziland is lead by the U.S. Ambassador and the USG inter-agency HIV/AIDS Task Force, which currently consists of the Emergency Plan Coordinator, CDC Technical Program Manager, members of the USAID/Regional HIV/AIDS Program, members of the CDC/Southern Africa Regional AIDS Program, Swaziland Peace Corps Director, and Department of Defense staff members.  

The U.S. Mission, the Task Force, and the Emergency Plan program partners have worked collaboratively over the past two years to achieve quality and rapid scale-up of USG-funded HIV/AIDS programming. The next two years, however, mark an important transition period for the Emergency Plan in Swaziland with a greater in-country staff presence.

F. Basic Functions: 

The incumbent is designated by the Chief of Mission (Ambassador) or his/her designate, to serve as principal point of contact and coordinator of activities related to the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (the Emergency Plan / PEPFAR) in Swaziland. 

The incumbent will facilitate the development and implementation of a unified PEPFAR program for Swaziland that makes best use of the comparative advantages and competencies of participating USG agencies, achieves maximum results related to the PEPFAR 2-7-10 targets, aligns with the Kingdom of Swaziland National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS, and is optimally responsive to the needs of Swazis infected and/or affected by HIV/AIDS. 

G. Duties and Responsibilities:  

•	Convening, chairing, and disseminating and retaining records of regular meetings of the Embassy PEPFAR Team.
•	Providing updates from OGAC’s weekly News to the Field and leading the discussion on its implications for EP work in Swaziland.
•	Facilitating meetings and disseminating and retaining records of meetings of technical working groups.
•	Managing operational and strategic planning processes to assure development of a balanced and focused PEPFAR program in Swaziland, supporting positive relationships across agencies and mediating interagency or interpersonal conflicts that may occur.
•	Facilitating and enforcing timely financial and programmatic reporting by all participating USG agencies and their implementing partners. This would specifically include providing leadership, coordination, and oversight with the preparation and electronic submission of the Mission's mini-Country Operational Plan (mini-COP) or HIV/AIDS segment of FY08 OP, and liaising with USG agencies to ensure timely completion of the necessary data entry.
•	Managing TDYs essential to the above as well as coordinating clearance for TDYs specific to the programs of individual USG implementing agencies to promote inter-agency benefits from TDYs wherever possible/appropriate.
•	Supporting efforts by USG implementing agencies to recruit, qualify, and successfully engage new, especially indigenous, partners in PEPFAR activities.
•	Preparing and disseminating periodic internal and external updates/status reports on PEPFAR in Swaziland. Internal audiences shall be limited to USG participants, including HQ. External audiences shall include Swazi partners and stakeholders, non-governmental implementing partners, and less frequently Swazi media and the general public.
•	Supervising staff deemed essential to effective coordination of the PEPFAR program in Swaziland.
•	Liaising with the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC), and particularly with the Swaziland “Support Team” named by OGAC.

E. Introduction and Background:  

Lesotho is experiencing one of the most severe HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world, affecting both urban and rural areas with equal ferocity.  With the third highest HIV prevalence rate in Sub-Saharan Africa, UNAIDS (2004) estimates that 28.9% of adults 15-49 years of age are infected with HIV.  This agrees with the 27.8 HIV prevalence rate among young pregnant women (15-24) in the capital city.  The estimated number of orphans due to AIDS living in Lesotho in 2003 is 100,000 (up from 68,000 in 2001).  With so many persons of productive age infected with HIV, the epidemic is not only a severe health crisis, but also a threat to the future development and economic viability of Lesotho as a nation.  

An estimated 320,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS including approximately 22,000 children between the ages of 0-14 years and 56,000 people in need of anti-retroviral treatment.  HIV prevalence is 14.4 percent among young women between the ages of 15-19 and suggests very high rates of new HIV infection.  The vast majority of new HIV infections can be attributed to a high prevalence of multiple, concurrent sexual partnerships.  Intergenerational sex, high mobility, and early ages of sexual debut for both young men and women may also contribute substantially to HIV transmission.

Although Lesotho is not among the 15 focus countries designated by the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the overwhelming magnitude of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Lesotho and its impact on neighboring countries merits concern and enhanced USG assistance.  The Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) is working closely with key USG agencies to address this situation.  Currently, the implementing USG agencies in country include the U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Southern Africa Regional HIV/AIDS Program (RHAP) the Department of Health and Human Services’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (HHS/CDC) Southern Africa Regional Program and U.S. Peace Corps.  Over the past two years the USG has significantly increased HIV/AIDS funding for Lesotho.


F. Basic Functions:

A.	Position Title: HIV/AIDS Program Director 

B.	Organizational Location of the Position: USAID Office in the U.S. Embassy, Mbabane, Swaziland

C.	Position Title of Direct Supervisor:    USAID Regional HIV/AIDS Program Director, Pretoria, South Africa

D.   Supervisory Controls: The USAID\Swaziland Program Director will work under the leadership of the Ambassador/DCM as part of the USG HIV/AIDS team in Swaziland.  The USAID\RHAP HIV/AIDS Health Officer will provide overall supervision to the HIV/ADIS Program Director, however he/she exercises the maximum degree of independent judgment in planning and carrying out tasks, resolving problems and conflicts, and taking steps necessary to meet deadlines.  Work results are usually reviewed only for attainment of objectives and conformance with policy objectives, the Emergency Plan goals, and Agency regulations.  The supervisor makes assignments in terms of broadly defined missions or functions, and provides administrative and policy direction.  The supervisor will be available to consult on technical issues

The HIV/AIDS Program Director will develop and obtain the RHAP Director’s agreement with an annual performance-based work plan that lays out specific work objectives.  While the incumbent will work with the maximum independence in completing agreed-upon work objectives and carrying-out his/her responsibilities, s/he will immediately inform his/her supervisor of problems and/or issues that arise that may affect the successful implementation of the USAID HIV/AIDS program in Swaziland.  


E. Introduction and Background:  Swaziland is a non-focus but high priority country under the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (Emergency Plan), a unified USG initiative that from 2004 to 2008 is contributing globally to the fight against HIV/AIDS. 

Swaziland has the most severe national HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis crisis in the world, with an adult HIV prevalence rate at 42.6 percent. This unprecedented crisis requires an emergency response. Under the President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Emergency Plan), the United States Government (USG) employs strategies, principles and resources to assist Swaziland in containing, reversing, and mitigating the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 

The USG Emergency Plan program works closely with the Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland (GKOS) at all levels to address the policy, advocacy, financial, and technical challenges which constrain Swaziland’s ability to halt the epidemic. Close collaboration is a feature of the significant financial and technical support provided by USG. Additionally, the USG is by far the single largest and most significant contributor to Swaziland’s national response, both through the Emergency Plan and through the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM). USG Emergency Plan resources for Swaziland were $7 million dollars in FY 2006, of which USAID is directly managing $4.9 million.  

The Emergency Plan in Swaziland is lead by the U.S. Ambassador and the USG inter-agency HIV/AIDS Task Force, which currently consists of the Emergency Plan Coordinator, CDC Technical Program Manager, members of the USAID/Regional HIV/AIDS Program, members of the CDC/Southern Africa Regional AIDS Program, Swaziland Peace Corps Director, and Department of Defense staff members.  

The U.S. Mission, the Task Force, and the Emergency Plan program partners have worked collaboratively over the past two years to achieve quality and rapid scale-up of USG-funded HIV/AIDS programming. The next two years, however, mark an important transition period for the Emergency Plan in Swaziland with a greater in-country staff presence.

F. Basic Functions: The HIV/AIDS Program Director is a new position and fills a key management role on the USG team.  The HIV/AIDS Program Director works with the Swaziland USG team and helps to design, manage and implement of the USG strategy and country operational plan. There is no USAID mission presence in Swaziland and hence, the position will be located in the US Embassy Mbabane.   

The USG program mirrors the National Strategic Plan (NSP) in calling for expanded prevention programs, including support for a comprehensive ABC approach, with linkages to HIV testing and care. The USAID HIV/AIDS Program Director will lead and coordinate USG prevention efforts in Swaziland. FY 2007 priorities the USG prevention portfolio include behavior change, the promotion of correct and consistent use in select settings, gender integration, PEP, Male Circumcision, and Prevention with Positives (PwP) programming. 

The HIV/AIDS Program Director contributes to USAID Swaziland’s ability to achieve results, as described in the Swaziland PEPFAR Country Strategy and in the 2007 Emergency Plan Country Operational Plan (COP), by providing essential programmatic expertise and guidance related key functions that s/he manages and coordinates. Country-specific targets exist and are measured on an annual basis.  USAID and its NGO partners are under great pressure to efficiently and effectively respond.  Tremendous implementation challenges are foreseen and the process must be transparent and accountable.  The HIV/AIDS Program Director will be required to ensure accountability of activities through results monitoring and reporting and responding in a timely manner to S/GAC requests. The HIV/AIDS Program Director also plays the lead role in documenting and reporting USAID program performance in Swaziland.  The responsibilities of the position as described below (Section IV.) are likely to increase in complexity as the Emergency Plan program in Swaziland matures.

Duties include regular contact and collaboration with both policy and technical level counterparts in Swaziland’s National Emergency Response Committee on HIV/AIDS (NERCHA), the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, other government ministries and agencies, a wide range of civil society and private organizations, other donor and international organizations, and USG agencies working on HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care, and mitigation up to the level of the U.S. Ambassador.

This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region. They are the decision makers for thi s initiative. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The TPRB will review the responses and determine acceptability. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to particip ate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. A three-week period will be allotted to vendors for shipment. Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a likert scale weighted equally on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree  worst score) to 5 (Strongly Agree  best score).  Minimum clinical acceptability is considered a total average scor e of 3.0 or above on a five scale rating. The TPRB has set a 3.0 acceptability threshold for all product groups.

<SUBJECT>D -- High Performance Global Parallel File System
<SOLNBR>FILESYSTEM2007
<RESPDATE>041607
<ARCHDATE>05012007
<CONTACT>Lynn Rippe, Manager of Subcontracts, Phone 254-939-5514, Fax 254-939-5517, Email lerippe@lbl.gov
<DESC>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and NERSC, in support of the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science, is seeking information on a high performance parallel global filesystem which will provide a unified namespace accessible in parallel from all NERSC production computing resources at near native cluster rates.  Current systems at NERSC include: 1) Cray XT4 system Linux/Catamount, 2)IBM Power 5 AIX cluster, 3) LNXI Opteron Infiniband Linux cluster, 4) SGI Altix IA64 NUMA Linux, 5) IBM Power 3 AIX cluster, and 5) IA32/x86_64 commodity Linux cluster.  

NERSC adds one or more systems a year with a very large system arriving every three years.  NERSC anticipates all those systems to be openly competed and cannot limit possible future choices based on its global filesystem.

The access patterns at NERSC are varied, but many applications require highly concurrent I/O to large, single files.  High aggregate rates of single streams are also needed, but not the primary mechanism of use.  I/O formats includes MPI/IO, HDF5, NetCDF, and POSIX (both many processes writing to single file and many processes writing to many files). 

Please explain how the following requirements would be met and supported:

Functionality Requirements:  1.	The filesystem must be deployable to all existing and future NERSC systems. 1a. What kinds of systems are currently and planned to be supported (both hardware and OS)? 1b. If direct support for these systems is not provided, explain how your filesystem can provide high speed, parallel access for them, what performance might be expected and identify time frames of availability. 1c. Explain how future NERSC systems of undefined architecture/OS would be supported.

2. The facility wide global file system must exist separate from all NERSC systems (i.e., it must be a stand-alone sub component of the NERSC Facility). 2a. NERSC computational systems have different maintenance and upgrade schedules.  The filesystem must be available (the entire name space accessible at expected performance) independent of the availability of any individual system.  It must be possible to shutdown any NERSC ?client? system and have the file system remain available on the other systems.  2b. The file system must be able to be administered and maintained independent of any individual client system.

3. The facility wide global file system must co-exist with local file systems on the NERSC systems. Each NERSC system usually has a set of file systems of various types (e.g., Lustre, GPFS, XFS, and NFS) that are local to that system and managing storage that is dedicated to that system.  The global file system must not interfere with the operation of these local file systems. Note:  the ultimate goal is that there be minimal local storage on any system, but how close NERSC is able to come to the ultimate goal is dependent on the performance and reliability of the facility wide global file system.  Additionally, the existing systems already have local storage to varying degrees.

4. POSIX file system API and semantics: 4a. NERSC users run a variety of codes that are written with the expectation of file system compliance with POSIX file system API and semantics. 4b. If the filesystem provides extensions to POSIX, identify them and explain their purpose. 4c. If filesystem deviates from POSIX, identify how it does and what the implications are for applications. 4d. Identify any relaxation of the POSIX standard that are allowed or required to improve performance.  Are these sites configurable?

5. The global file system must be capable of being delivered via IP networks.  Other, lower level network protocols are required for specific systems.

6. Multiple independent instances of the filesystem must be accessible by the same client system.

7. The global file system must be expandable in both capacity and aggregate bandwidth.  Describe the: 7a. Ability to dynamically increase or reduce the size of an existing file system. 7b. Ability to dynamically increase or reduce the number of files an existing file system can support (e.g., increase the number of i-nodes). 7c.	Ability to dynamically increase the I/O performance of an existing file system when additional hardware is added to the file system.

8. Parallel I/O.  8a. Describe how you support parallel (concurrent) access to a single file from multiple client nodes. 8b.  Describe how you support parallel (concurrent) access to multiple files by multiple clients. 8c.	Describe how you support the ability to increase the single-file parallel I/O performance with the increase of new hardware. 8d. Identify any extensions for MPI-IO that you provide.

9. No single point of failure.  The global file system must be able to be configured with no single point of failure (hardware or software).

10. The global file system must be capable of running some subset of multiple versions of the file system software. 10a. This is necessary in order to permit rolling upgrades so a simultaneous upgrade of all clients and/or servers is not required.  10b.	This is necessary in order to accommodate different system OS requirements and upgrade availability. 10c. Explain what multi-version capabilities the filesystem is able to support and any limitations on the simultaneous use of multiple file system software versions.

Scalability and Performance Requirements  11. File system must scale to support a large number of clients now and substantially more in the future.  11a. NERSC now has approximately 10K client nodes, both single and multiple CPUs/cores, with approximately 30K CPUs/cores. 11b. In the 2009 time frame with the NERSC-6 system, NERSC is expected to grow to approximately 50k to 100k client nodes with multiple CPUs/cores per node. 11c. Between now and 2009, the number of client nodes and CPUs is likely to grow substantially, but incrementally. 11d. Explain what features your file system has which will allow it to operate at this scale and how you will support the necessary number of clients now and in the future.  11e. Multi-PetaByte (PB) filesystem capacity per filesystem instance.  What is the current size limitation of the filesystem? 11f. Explain any architectural limitations on the size to which a single instance of your file system can grow. 11g. Indicate the current maximum per file system capacities supported now and your roadmap for increased capacities.

12. File system must support individual files that are a significant fraction of the file system capacity.  Explain any architectural limitations in the: 12a.	Number of individual files the filesystem can support.  NERSC desires over a billion files/filesystem.  12b.	Number of files per directory that can be supported. NERSC desires over a billion/directory.

13. Filesystem must be capable of scalable aggregate streaming I/O performance. 13a.	NERSC currently needs 18 GB/s end user aggregate multi-node streaming I/O performance.  This aggregate performance is across all file system instances. 13b. In the 2009 time frame, with the NERSC-6 system, NERSC is expected to need approximately 60 GB/s aggregate streaming performance. 13c. Between now and 2009, aggregate streaming performance will need to increase in relation to the growth in the number of client systems and nodes and their performance. 13d. Explain how you would accomplish the necessary initial aggregate streaming I/O bandwidth and accommodate future bandwidth requirements. 13e. Explain any architectural or current implementation limits on single file system and aggregate file system streaming I/O bandwidth.

14. Scalable meta-data operation rates (e.g., file creates).  Explain what mechanisms your filesystem has to scale up the meta-data operations rates.  Please address performance for meta data operations on files in the same directory as well as different directories. 

15. Please explain any hardware assumptions made in the above responses

16. Please identify any required hardware or software that is needed or assumed for your file system.

Licensing and Support

17. Describe how the filesystem is licensed and the costs for: 17a. Individual cpu systems. 17b. Multiple cpu systems. 17c. Clusters of single and multiple cpu systems. 17d. Clusters where only a few I/O nodes run the filesystem software and thousands of compute nodes forward I/O to the I/O nodes. 17e. Is a site-wide license offered, and under what terms? 17f. Is there a volume discount offered? 17g. Is there a published price list?  Where?

18. Describe the yearly support costs for the filesystem.

19. Describe licensing and support costs for the current NERSC systems: 19a. Cray XT4 system Linux/Catamount: 9712 nodes total, 2 processors per node, 9672 compute nodes; 40 I/O nodes, and a 54 node test system. 19b. IBM Power 5 AIX cluster: 122 nodes total, 8 processors per node, 111 compute nodes; 6 I/O nodes, and a 2 node test system. 19c. LNXI Opteron Infiniband Linux cluster: 391 nodes, 2 processors per node, 356 compute nodes; 20 I/O nodes, and a 10 node test system. 19d. SGI Altix IA64 NUMA Linux: 32 processors IA32/x86_64. 19e. IBM Power 3 AIX cluster: 416 nodes total, 16 processors per node, 380 compute nodes; 20 I/O nodes, and a 4 node test system. 19f. Commodity Linux cluster: 400 nodes total, 2 processors per node, 235 compute nodes; 102 I/O nodes, and a 10 node test system.

20. Describe what price and terms & conditions protection there would be for NERSC?s future systems.
21. Signify your acceptance of the University of California Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory General Provisions without exception or change.

The existing building consists of 21,461 gross square meters.  The total area for this facility at the conclusion of renovations will provide 25,983 gross square meters. 

The scope of the project entails: (1) total renovation of W200 to accommodate spaces for SSP & NIPO, and other designated Navy tenants (NCIS, OJAG, and others as space permits); (2) bringing facility into compliance with current codes and standards (eg, life safety, ADA/handicap accessibility, ATFP, energy efficiency, etc); (3) relocation of SSP and NIPO from their temporary leased spaces to W200; (4) relocation of some existing W200 tenants to new permanent locations; and (5) provision of swing space for some existing W200 tenants (OJAG, NCIS) who will ultimately remain in W200 after the renovation.. 

It is the responsibility of the successful design builder to review, validate, and reconcile all tenant program information so that a final approved program will fit within the target gross square meters;  the design builder will (after contract award) meet with all tenants and review program information. Tenants include those designated to (1) move into Bldg W200 and (2) move out of Bldg W200, and (3) remain in Building W200.  The successful design build contractor will be responsible for validating the information with the existing tenants and proposed tenants and to develop a final space program, including all furniture and equipment needs of those tenants.  Full interior design services are required, including furniture and equipment layout, procurement, and installation.

In general, the types of spaces required by tenants include admin spaces, open and closed office environments, conference spaces, computer spaces, teaching spaces, SCIF spaces, storage spaces, support spaces, and Naval Exchange/Food.  Work also involves exterior site work, utility connections, and hazardous material handling and abatement.  W200 exterior and interior renovation shall include the total removal of all existing mechanical, electrical, communications, plumbing, fire protection systems and walls, windows and all architectural finishes, unless noted otherwise.

The design builder will develop phasing strategies that will require certain tenants to swing into temporary space (outside W200) and then return, and will allow certain spaces and functions to remain operational during construction with as little disturbance as possible during construction activities. 

Project construction costs will total in the range of $55 - $65 million.  All service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, certified HUBZone small businesses, and certified 8(a) small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to respond.

The recorder must be capable of hard-mounting to aircraft structure without need for special shock mounts. Construction in accordance with MIL-HDBK-454 is a design goal.  The ground based recorder system must be either capable of operating in a ground or ship-board facility using 115VAC 60 Hz power or the storage module must be compatible with a ground-bench style recorder/reproducer. 

The recorder system must be of modular construction such that data input/output interfaces may be added, removed, or reconfigured in the field using common electronics shop tools.  Desired baseline recorder data interface styles and quantities include 10/100/1000Base-T Ethernet (1 channel), 10/100/1000Base-T Ethernet optical (1 channel), MIL-STD-1553B RT & BM (1), RS 170/NTSC video (4), RS 343/RGB video (1), IEEE 1394 Firewire (1); wideband analog audio (8) , and RS 422/485 serial channels (8). Video and audio signals must be capable of being independently and simultaneously recorded and reproduced in a linear tape media emulation mode.    The recorder system must have sufficient memory bandwidth to accommodate simultaneous real-time recording of this minimum set of data.  The recorder must accept a time code signal in accordance with the ICD-GPS-060A Precise Time and Time Interval (HAVEQUICK) standard.  This time source will be used to synchronize frame-by-frame time encoding of the data channels.  The recorder must be capable of seeking and retrieving individual data frames using the time code.  The time code must be stored using a method permitting reproduction in IRIG-B format. The recorder must provide a remote control panel interface permitting mode selection and motion control for linear tape emulation channels.  The recorder must also provide an interface suitable for full integrated control by an external mission computer via RS 422/485, 10/100/1000 Base-T Ethernet using TCP/IP, or MIL-STD-1553B.

The recorder must be capable of accommodating growth data interface styles including ARINC 429, ECL, LVDS, and discrete signals (5V, 28V, and Open/Ground.)  Additional growth channels of the previously described baseline video, audio and data styles are desired.   An open published interface to the data recorder is desired to permit third party development of legacy proprietary data interfaces.

An O-level to OEM maintenance concept is anticipated for the recorder system.  However, the field-level modularity and built-in-test capabilities of the recorder system should support organic end-user maintenance at the module Shop Replaceable Assembly (SRA) level.  Data requirements include such drawings and documents necessary to support aircraft design and integration, installation, operation, and in-service maintenance of the recorder system and ground-based units.

The Government anticipates contract award no later than 31 July 2007 for an initial buy of three aircraft units and two ground-based units for evaluation including all interface and electrical components required to support installation.  The required delivery schedule for these units is no later than 3-4 months after contract award.

The Government does not intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Any company that would like the Government to consider their existing recorder system for the future procurement of this requirement should express their interest in writing.  Please include a company pamphlet or brochure; a description of the existing recorder system including specifications, capabilities, and lead time for delivery; and a point of contact including telephone number and address.  Written and/or electronic responses should not exceed 10 typed pages and must be received by 15 April 2007, to Naval Air Systems Command, 47123 Buse Road, Unit #IPT, BLDG 2272, Rm. 155, ATTN: Kent Munro, MH-60 Program (AIR-2.3.2.4.14), Patuxent River, MD     20670-1547.   Submissions will not be returned.

<DESC>HHS awarded RTI International (RTI) a contract in 2005 to ? in direct collaboration with states, territories, and other state-level stakeholders ? (1) assess variations in organization-level business policies and state laws that affect health information exchange; (2) identify and propose practical solutions, while preserving the privacy and security requirements in applicable Federal and state laws and (3) develop detailed plans to implement solutions.  Subsequently, through an open competition, RTI solicited states and territories to submit proposals to be part of the RTI-led Health Information Privacy and Security Collaboration (HISPC) to complete this work.  Thirty-four (34) states and territories were selected and funded by RTI as subcontractors to be part of HISPC.  At the conclusion of the HISPC?s work, states and territories will have developed implementation plans to address privacy and security variations in organization ? level business policies and state laws that affect health information exchange in their jurisdictions.  

Continuing this work and preserving momentum that states and territories within the HISPC have generated is essential to developing and preparing states and territories for regional and nationwide electronic health information exchange.  HHS intends to extend RTI?s contract on a non-competitive basis for the remainder of 2007 to continue the HISPC work in the form of managing and funding HISPC subcontractors? implementation plan(s).  This new work is intended to be a preparatory step for a future full and open competition planned for late 2007 to fund the coordination and facilitation of regional and multi-state privacy and security solution development for electronic health information exchange.  Given RTI?s experience, unique position, and relationship with the 34 state subcontractors that make up HISPC ? which subcontracts would need to be renegotiated if another contractor were awarded this extension ? the Government believes that RTI is the only source through which this work could be carried out without delay and interruption in the time frame specified above.

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above.  Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government?s requirements as described above.  No solicitation document is available.  Capability statements should be submitted within 11 days of the publication of this synopsis to the contact point and address given above.

<CONTACT>David Paveglio, Contracts Administrator, Phone 631-344-8461, Fax 631-344-5499, Email dpavegli@bnl.gov
<DESC>Science Associates has a requirement for an amplified Ti:sapphire-laser-based spectroscopy system planned for the Ultrafast Laser Facility at the Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL).

The system is designed to collect transient absorption spectra of nanostructures and molecules suspended in solution (in transmission) or supported on solid surfaces (in reflection). Spectra will be measured by pump-probe methods, where the pump will be ultrafast pulses (~ 100 fs temporal width) from either a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier in the near-IR (~ 800 nm) or an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) equipped with a frequency mixer to generate pulses in the UV to NIR (240 – 2600 nm). Transient spectra will be collected with probe light derived from white-light continuum generation in an ultrafast spectrometer providing multichannel single shot data acquisition over a 450 – 1600 nm wavelength range. The time response function of the spectrometer will be better than 150 fs (FWHM) with a noise level below 0.0002 OD (with 5 seconds of averaging).

The design critera were chosen to enable time-resolved dynamical studies of a wide range of nanostructured and supramolecular materials. Dynamics of interest include that of hot carriers, electron-phonon coupling, plasmons, nanoparticle acoustic modes, short-lived fluorescent states, molecule-particle coupling and nanoparticle surface chemistry.

The overall system will comprise six subsystems which are described in brief here and specified in detailed below. These systems must be designed such that the component systems are compatible and function together to deliver all required performance specifications listed in § II.B. Preference will be shown to a single vendor that can source and support all laser subsystems (Subsystems 1, 2, 3) and deliver most or all of the requested laser diagnostics (Subsystem 6 – the IR viewer, the power meters, the ultrafast-pulse measurement device and the fiber optic spectrometer). 

The following are the six subsystems:

1.	Ti:sapphire Oscillator
2.	Ti:sapphire Regenerative Amplifier
3.	Optical Parametric Amplifier (OPA) and Frequency Mixer
4.	Ultrafast Spectrometer
5.	Optical Tables and Enclosures
6.	Laser Diagnostics

This acquisition is planned as, a “Best Value” procurement.  The utilization of this procedure is expected to provide the greatest overall benefit to BSA/BNL.  Best Value employs a trade off process that permits award to other than the lowest priced offeror or to the highest technically rated offeror.  The tradeoff process, associated with Best Value involves a comparative weighing of the evaluation factors and sub-factors identified in the Request for Proposals (RFP).   Specifically, the trade off process involves selecting the most advantageous offer based upon an integrated assessment of both non-cost/price factors, taking in their assigned relative importance.  BSA will evaluate offers received under this RFP based upon technical compliance and overall system cost.  Awards may be made to multiple offerors in order to effectuate a system providing the “Best Value” to BSA.  The following factors have been identified as significant measures of equipment design and performance.

Detailed information as to RFP pricing requirements are contained in the “Instructions to Offeror” which may be downloaded from this website.

The following factors, in their relative order of weighting, will be utilized to evaluate the offers:



1.  Specification Compliance
Subsystem 1 - Ti:sapphire Oscillator System
Subsystem 2 - Ti:sapphire Regenerative Amplifier
Subsystem 3 - Optical Parametric Amplifier (OPA) and Frequency Mixer

<SUBJECT>D -- Intellitactics Software
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The Government intends to negotiate and award a sole source purchase order with Immix Technology, Inc. for Intellitactics software licenses and maintenance support for its existing systems. Macdill AFB intends to issue a purchase order to Immix under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the existing agency requirements, for the following reasons stated in the J&A: ?The Network Security Management (NSM) standard maintenance and support is developed by and owned by Intellitactics. Intellitacs utilizes only one distributor to sell its product. That distributor is Immix Technology.  USSOCOM requires Intellitactic Network Security Management (NSM) support to keep our current NSM system operational and current to protect USSOCOM networks against cyber attack.  Intellitactics has been at the headquarters and all subordinate component commands.  The vendor is familiar with the USSOCOM enterprise architecture and can provide expert technical advice and support at a level another vendor cannot approach.  Intellitactics Network Security Management (NSM) is the only Security Incident Measurement (SIM) tool that meets the standards of DODI 8500.2.  Without this service, USSOCOM will not be able to effectively monitor its networks that are being used to support the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).  To purchase the required software from any source, other than Intellitactics, would require the use of additional resources for testing and approving compatibility with the current network.  An estimate of the additional cost is approximately $750,000.00.  Without this sole source procurement, there would be a substantial duplication of cost, to the Government, that would not be expected to be recovered through full and open competition.? 
This announcement constitutes the only announcement. A written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-16.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 511210  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) is 7372 with a small business size of $23 million.

<SUBJECT>A -- Future Naval Capabilities in Air Warfare and Weapons
<DESC>The ONR Future Naval Capability (FNC) Program was conceived in 1999 to address the perception that ONR had too few programs with sufficient funding to reach technical maturity for transition to acquisition.  The FNC program was designed to focus S&T critical mass on highest priority capabilities of the Naval Forces, and ensure focused transition to acquisition.

The FNC program is composed of Enabling Capabilities (ECs) which develop and deliver quantifiable products (i.e., prototype systems, knowledge products, and technology improvements) in response to validated requirements for insertion into acquisition programs of record.

Each year, new ECs are proposed and selected.  An ONR-wide process for selection of EC’s to begin in FY10 will begin this September with the nomination of a number of EC proposals by various ONR departments.  After the EC programs are selected, the assigned program officers will arrange for the publication of solicitations that will lead to awards.  These solicitations would probably not be issued before 2009.

This request for information (RFI) is soliciting information that could be used to develop several EC proposals likely to be nominated by ONR’s Air Warfare and Weapons S&T Department (ONR 35) for inclusion in the next round of ECs.

<SUBJECT>A -- Automated-In-Motion Vehicle Evaluation Environment (AIMVEE)
<DESC>SOLE POINT OF CONTACT FOR THIS SOLICITATION:  Mark Reeves, Commercialization Manager, Voice (865) 576-2577, FAX (865) 574-9241, E-mail reevesme@ornl.gov.  DO NOT USE THE POINT OF CONTACT (LANCE COPELAND) SHOWN BELOW.



Opportunity:  UT-Battelle, LLC, the management and operating contractor for the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is offering the opportunity, for one or more industrial partners to license and commercialize UT-Battelle’s Automated-In-Motion Vehicle Evaluation Environment (AIMVEE).
Background:  The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has been involved in Weigh-in-Motion Research with both government agencies and private companies since 1989.  Programs have been undertaken with organizations such as Department of Energy, Defense Nuclear Agency, the United States Air Force, the United States Army, Federal Highway Administration, ORNL’s National Security Program Office, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, United States Transportation Command, Air Force Air Mobility Battle Laboratory, Center for the Commercial Deployment of Transportation Technologies, and several private suppliers. 
Description:  The Automated-In-Motion Vehicle Evaluation Environment (AIMVEE) development is focused on improving accuracy, automatically identifying the vehicles and cargo, and interfacing with deployment, load planning, and in-transit visibility military information systems.  ORNL has enhanced the portable WIM Gen I system with improved algorithms for determining weight and COB as well as upgraded electronics to improve accuracy. Other enhancements include on-board processing, modifications to simplify field operation (setup, use, dismantling, storage and trans-shipment), state-of-the art load cell transducers and electronics, and optimized transducer spacing. The system also includes a digital imaging system for determining the height, length and width of a vehicle automatically.


ADVANTAGES:  The AIMVEE system ORNL developed is a field-ruggedized system that can go anywhere the military deploys, identify vehicle and cargo automatically, weigh and measure vehicles and cargo safer and faster, provide the data automatically to all authorized systems and users, and be transportable in the back of the last vehicle to be loaded. The system is designed with an individual on-board processor on each transducer which allows simplified field setup and operation allowing vehicles to pass over the system from either direction.  The ORNL AIMVEE system utility is thus has been developed and tested and is suitable to be used by a variety of governmental (federal, state and local) and private organizations that need a portable (two-man transportable) device to weigh and measure conveyances and cargo in less than optimal conditions.


DEVELOPMENT STATUS:  The AIMVEE system is fully developed and has been deployed and field tested for more than two years. A complete design package is available which includes not only the hardware specifications but also the copyrighted software to operate the system and interface with deployment, load planning, and in-transit visibility military information systems. The AIMVEE system software has been developed to be readily adapted to interface with the perspective user’s information system(s) of choice.


INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY STATUS:  ORNL Automated-In-Motion Vehicle Evaluation Environment (AIMVEE) technology embedded in the following pieces of UT-Battelle Intellectual Property:
Invention Disclosure Numbers 1380, “Asset Identification and Information Infrastructure Management System” (patent pending) and 1396, “Improved System and Method for Weighing and Characterizing Moving Vehicles” (patent pending); 
Invention Disclosure Number 1805, “Novel Improvements for Weigh-In-Motion System” and patents issuing therefrom (patent application in preparation);

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) OR Request for Quotations (RFQ)] for STATEMENT OF WORK FOR CONFIGURATION SUPPORT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM – DISASTER MONITORING CONSTELLATION (UK-DMC) SATELLITE INTRODUCTION  NASA Glenn Research Center is performing research regarding advanced space-based sensor web, delay/disruption tolerant networking (DTN) protocol development and bundling agent discover.  In all cases, the efforts require access to IP compliant space-based assets using multiple ground stations.  Furthermore, the nature of the system development requires secure autonomous machine-to-machine scheduling of such assets.   To support the three inter-related research efforts, NASA’s Earth/Sun Science Technology Office (ESTO) is funding NASA Glenn Research Center for development of autonomous, automated service agreements between the secure autonomous intelligent controller and ground systems.  These autonomous, automated service agreements will enable NASA to obtain near real-time access to space-based assets – in this case the Cisco router in Low Earth Orbit (CLEO) onboard the Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) United Kingdom - Disaster Monitoring Constellation satellite (UK-DMC).   NASA is currently using General Dynamics’ virtual mission operations center (VMOC) as the intelligent controller thereby leveraging millions of dollars of DoD’s and General Dynamics’ investments.	NASA also has a Space Act Agreement (SAA) with Cisco to perform joint space-based Internet research and has been allowed to use CLEO for this effort via that SAA.   In addition, NASA has a contract for ground station support with Universal Space Networks (USN).	Both General Dynamics and USN have established working relationships with SSTL and Cisco and understand that the UK-DMC is an operational, money-making system with a Cisco experimental payload onboard.	General Dynamics also has knowledge and understanding of operations of the UK-DMC commanding and of SSTL’s business operations and practices.    Furthermore, SSTL and General Dynamics have already been working to develop some automated machine-to-machine communications between the VMOC and SSTL’s Mission Planning System (MPS).	 PURPOSE NASA wishes to obtain spacecraft configuration and experimentation support service for the Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) Satellites and in particular, the United Kingdom (UK) DMC.    TASK 1 – DEVELOPMENT OF 38.4 KBPS PASS THROUGH FIRMWARE NASA is performing joint research with the US Army Space and Missile Defense Battle Lab (SMDB).  SMDB possess a ground station capable of communicating with the UK-DMC.  The gain of the current phased array antenna cannot provide a quality downlink at 8 Mbps.  However, it can close link at 38.4 kbps.   SSTL has developed software for CLEO that supports an 8 Mbps downlink and 9.6 kbps uplink.    The contractor shall develop software and firmware to support 9.6 kbps uplink and 38.4 kbps downlink with access to CLEO. This work is required within the first 3 months of the start of the contract. TASK 2 – CONFIGURATION OF UK-DMC FOR EXPERIMENTAL PASSES NASA is performing research using the UK-DMC.  For this research, multiple ground stations are to be used include: SSTL Ground Station in Guildford, England National Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Japan (NICT) Multi-User Ground Station in Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA; Universal Space Network ground stations in Alaska, Hawaii, and Australia. In order to send or receive data to the UK-DMC via any station, SSTL must configure the UK-DMC to transmit or receive as well as configure for which rates to transmit.  Furthermore, in order to access the Cisco router, SSTL must configure on SSDR to be in pass-through mode and this mode must conform to the desired frequency.	 The contractor shall configure the spacecraft for the appropriate configuration requested for each satellite pass.  Configurations shall be for: 1)  Receive only telemetry at 38.4 kbps downlink 2)  Low rate receive and transmit to the Onboard Processor 3)  Low rate receive and transmit to the Cisco router (CLEO) 4)  High-rate image passes via the SSDR 5)  High-rate image passes via the Cisco Route This work is an ongoing requirement for the extent of the contract.   TASK 3 – GROUND STATION CONFIGURATION SUPPORT FOR IPV6 AND DELAY/DISRUPTION TOLERANT NETWORKING NASA is performing IPv6 and Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking research using CLEO or the Solid State Data Recorders (SSDRs) onboard the UK-DMC.  In order to support this effort using the SSTL ground station, the ground infrastructure must be upgraded or enhanced. The contractor shall work with NASA GRC to enhance the SSTL ground terminal infrastructure as follows: 1)	Add IPv6 and IPsec capability to the ground router 2)	Modify the existing ground router to: a.	Enable IPv4 mobile-ip; b.	Enable IPv4 static routing; c.	Add IPv6-to-IPv4 tunnels between the NASA Home Agent Router and the SSTL ground router; d.	Enable IPv6 Static Routing between the SSTL ground router and CLEO; and, e.	Enable IPv4 IPsec tunnels between the SSTL ground router and CLEO. 3)	Add DTN bundle forwarding agent capability to the SSTL ground infrastructure. This work is required within the first 9 months of the start of the contract. TASK 4 – UPLOAD OF SOLID STATE DATA RECORDER IMAGES OR PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT EXPERIMENTATION NASA is performing advanced protocol networking research using the Solid State Data Recorders (SSDRs) onboard the UK-DMC.  In order to support this effort, new protocol images must upload to the SSTL SSDR. Once protocols have been tested in the NASA GRC UK-DMC engineering testbed and confirmed to operate properly, the contract shall schedule the UK-DMC for protocol testing and upload the image.   The following protocols shall be supported: 1)	Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking, a application layer store and forward protocol; and  2)	Seamless IP-diversity-based Generalized Mobility Architecture (SIGMA), a transport-layer mobility protocol. This work is an ongoing requirement for the extent of the contract.   TASK 5 – SUPPORT FOR SECURE AUTOMATION AND SCHEDULING OF DMC ASSETS BY AN INTELLIGENT CONTROLLER NASA Glenn Research Center is performing research regarding advanced space-based sensor web. NASA is currently using General Dynamics’ virtual mission operations center (VMOC) as the intelligent controller.	To support near-real-time access to space, NASA is developing a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that requires machine-to-machine automated scheduling.  Under this task, the contractor shall support development of machine-to-machine automated scheduling and configuration of the UK-DMC.    This work is required within the first 9 months of the start of the contract.

SOURCE SELECTION CRITERIA
The items being offered must be mature commercial off the shelf items with proven field usage.  The source selection will be based on proposals that provide the best value to the Government.  Technical acceptability will be rated on a PASS/FAIL basis.  To be technically acceptable, the offeror must receive a rating of pass in each of the minimum capability categories as described above (see 1 – 14).  If the product is not technically acceptable, no further proposal evaluation will be conducted.  

EVALUATION FACTORS

I.	Past Performance
a.	Quality
b.	Timeliness
c.	Business Professionalism
d.	Customer Satisfaction

II.  Experience
III. Price	
Factors to be evaluated are Past Performance, Experience and Price.  These elements are listed in descending order of importance.  Past Performance and Experience combined are more important than price.  Subfactors under the factor of Past Performance are:  Quality, Timeliness, Business Professionalism, and Customer Satisfaction.  The subfactors are equal in importance.  There are no subfactors under Experience and Price.  
Technical Proposals must include Descriptive Literature to include copies of Warranty and Operations and Maintenance Manuals for products being proposed, and product samples at no cost to the Government.   Any contractor providing samples is responsible for shipping costs to and from Lakehurst.   Product Samples must be received at Lakehurst no later than 12 April 2007.  Products will be evaluated and compared to the minimum range of capabilities (See No. 1 – No. 14 above) to determine technical acceptability.   Matting samples will be returned in “as is” condition at the contractor’s request and expense.
For the factor of Experience, each proposal will be assigned a risk assessment rating.  The Risk Assessment ratings are:  Very Low Risk, Low Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk, Very High Risk and Unknown Risk.  Each offeror must identify actual design and assembly of Light Weight Matting to enable the Government to verify the offeror’s experience.  In making the determination of experience level, consideration will be given as to whether an offeror has experience in manufacturing matting of similar type and size.
For Past Performance, offerors must provide evidence of proven field usage, and names and phone numbers of recent customers, and prices to previous customers for mat that is identical or similar to those being proposed herein.   Offerors will complete Attachment 1 for three (3) contracts relevant to this procurement.  The Government will conduct a performance risk evaluation based upon the past performance of the offeror as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the solicitation requirements.  The Risk Assessment ratings are:  Very Low Risk, Low Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk, Very High Risk and Unknown Risk.   Unknown risk is a neutral rating, and will apply to offerors with no past performance in this commodity.  The Government may also consider past performance information that is available from sources other than those identified by the offeror.  
For Price, offerors are requested to separately price their matting and accessories by completing Section B.  Each required accessory (i.e. jack kits, stakes, etc.) should be priced separately.  In addition, offerors must include a commercial price list of their products and accessories with part numbers.  Each offeror’s price proposal will be evaluated using a quantity of 100 units for each of the five years for matting, and a quantity of 10 units for each of the five years for the accessories.   This quantity represents the most likely quantity to be ordered per year.    

GREATEST VALUE EVALUATION
The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to that responsible offeror, conforming to the solicitation determined to represent the best value to the Government cost/price and other factors considered.  The offeror’s proposal shall be in the form prescribed by this solicitation and shall contain a response to each of the areas identified, which affect the evaluation factors for award.
Evaluation of an offeror’s proposal will be based on the information presented in the written proposal along with input obtained from outside sources relevant to past performance.  Proposals which are unrealistic in terms of technical or schedule commitments may be deemed to be reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence, or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed factors or subfactors, may be used as a basis for eliminating a proposal from further consideration.  
The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror’s methods and approach in meeting the requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence to ensure successful performance.  Each Factor will be evaluated and assigned a risk assessment rating.
The Government may award a contract on the basis of initial offers received, without discussions.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms.  However, if considered necessary by the Contracting Officer, discussions will be conducted with only those offeror’s determined to have a reasonable chance for award.  The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced offeror if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.

The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this RFQ to a responsible offeror using the lowest price technically acceptable process.  Quotes shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotes meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:  Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement and Factor 2 ? Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a ?go/no go? basis.  If a quote has been determined to be a ?go? on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror?s past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quote and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its quote evaluated for the lowest price.
Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of descriptive literature that clearly indicates what the offeror is proposing and will be providing all products in accordance with the stated characteristics in the Scope of Work (SOW).  ?Descriptive literature? means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quote.  Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered meet the specifications in the SOW.  The information is required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  
                                              
Factor 2 ? Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offeror?s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror?s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror?s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror?s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quote will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

Offerors must submit a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3 OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS with the price offer, or may complete the representations and certifications on the internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Failure to include the certifications along with a price proposal will render an offeror ineligible for award.   All questions and inquiries should be addressed via email to the Contract Specialist POC, daniel.herring@dla.mil, Request for Quote Number SP3100-6339-3021.  Prices, representations/certifications, descriptive literature, and past performance information must be received NLT 4:00 PM EST on February 5, 2007.  This information should be submitted to the above email address or faxed to 717-770-7591.  Contractors must be capable of accepting payment by either electronic funds transfer or government credit card for this procurement.  ALL SOURCES MUST BE REGISTERED IN THE CENTRAL CONTRACT REGISTRATION DATABASE, http://www.ccr.gov/, or an award cannot be processed.

Note: Cartridges are a combination of OEM and remanufactured cartridges.<BR><BR>Brand Name Justification The planned procurement supports the newly established USPTO Tele-work and Patents Hoteling Programs. This procurement will also support the anticipated growth of the Patents Hoteling Program in FY2007 and for the next five years. The Patent Information Technology Product Support Division (PITPSD) provides Automated Information System (AIS) support for the USPTO and users of AIS used in the patent examining process and organizations, 1) desktop and tele-work systems, 2) OA hardware and software deployments, 3) network infrastructure configuration support, 4) AIS operational support and user training, 5) Automation consumable product procurement, 6) Asset Management, budgeting, and financial management. Currently, PITPSD provides toner cartridges for approximately 7,000 printers of which 1,500 are deployed to remote sites used by the patent hoteling participants. The work-at-home participants are provided with either a Dell 1600n or 1815n printer as part of the hardware configuration. Initially, all toner cartridges provided to the participants were new. As replacement toner was requested, PITPSD provided remanufactured brands, which resulted in a matrix of printer problems, hardware failures and loss of examining production time. The toner problems required the hoteling participants to make unscheduled visits to exchange the bad toner and in multiple cases they experienced the exact problems with the second remanufactured cartridge. The problems are well documented in a series of helpdesk tickets and e-mail correspondences. Because of these widespread adverse results, PITPSD requires the Dell brand name toner for the Dell 1600n and 1815n printers - which has solved the Dell printer problems for the Telework and Hoteling participants. The Dell brand name toner is also required because any product used in Dell printers other those manufactured by Dell may void the warranties. Moreover, the severity of printer problems is exacerbated by the fact that USPTO technical support for the Dell printers is not available at the 1,500 remote relocations.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Several contractors have conducted site visits at DDOO, and provided questions about the AV requirement.  The questions and answers that resulted from these site visits are included below.  A revised Scope of Work will be issued via a separate, subsequent Amendment to this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation.  Contractors must refer to the amended Scope of Work for changes to the requirement, and must provide quotes based upon the amended Scope of Work.

Contractor No. 1:
1. Source Equipment; is anything required as a source beyond the DVD and VHS equipment listed? A ? No. Where is this to be rack mounted? A ? SOW has been revised to address this.

2. Signal interfacing and distribution; What signals are to be interfaced and distributed? Where are they to be distributed to? Where is the switcher/scaler to be located? A ? SOW has been revised to address this.  Need for Switcher/scaler will depend upon system proposed by contractor.

3. Video display equipment; what is required; projector (lumens, resolution?), plasma(s), LCD(s)? Where is the 6x8 screen to be located? A ? SOW has been revised to address this.

4. Videoconference equipment; VSX 5000; Conference room is 46 feet by 26 feet. The specified VSX 5000 is intended for "smaller conference spaces" per the manufacturer. This is what Polycom says about the VSX5000; 
VSX 5000: Unmatched quality, performance at the entry level
Ideal for smaller conference spaces, this set-top system delivers market-leading
video and audio quality at an affordable price. VSX 5000 is well suited for
small group video conferencing with a high-quality electronic pan-tilt-zoom
(PTZ) camera. A real space-saver, the VSX 5000 sits conveniently on top of TVs, high-resolution plasma screens, or LCD displays.
Also, a listed requirement is" integrated multi-point capabilities" and the VSX 5000 does NOT have this capability.  A ? SOW has been revised to delete reference to VSX 5000.  Choice of make and model is up to the contractor.

5. Control system; should get Dave McCullough to take a quick look at this; not sure if all this will be needed or will work for what they want to do.  A ? This is a Contractor note to self, nothing to address.

6. Audio system; power amp, required power? 70V, 8ohm, stereo, surround? Ceiling microphone array; Polycom? 4 speakers? 70V, 8 ohm, what?  A ? SOW has been revised to address this. Contractor shall provide sufficient audio and microphone pickup for the room.

Contractor No. 3:
1. Unable to locate these items with RS232C control capability.  Do you have model numbers to reference?  A ? SOW has been revised to delete reference to RS-232; the only requirement is that the DVD-R can be operated by the control system.

2. Identify all sources for input to Video Scaler.  A ? SOW has been revised to remove requirement for Scaler and to identify all sources for inputs.

3. If we are to furnish and install a new rear project screen, who will remove the old one and rebuild the wall for the new screen.  A ? SOW has been revised to address this.

4 a. Requested VSX 5000 will not allow multi point access.

Observations:

1. Will any existing equipment in rack be retained?  A ? No.
    a. Who removes any unused equipment and wiring?  A ? The government will be responsible for this.

2. Will lighting modules be retained?  A ? Yes, if they are compatible with/can be used with the new system.

4. Is plenum wire required?  A ? No, unless it is required for the new system.	


Contractor No. 4:
1.	Government Responsibility did not mention the Mitsubishi XL5900LU Projector they are presently using. Are they going to use that projector to project on the rear projection screen? If the answer is yes are you going to buy a new lens for it? Or are you going to buy a mirror assembly to project on. The Projector in question will only project a 5?6? wide image on the projector screen from 10?6? throw distance.  A ? SOW has been revised to state that the Mitsubishi projector will be used/integrated with the new system.  Current screen size has been sufficient to date, there is no current need to increase screen size, but the government is open to contractor recommendations. 

2.	There was no mention for the ability to do teleconferencing from the room I looked at. Are they wanting to teleconference from this room? If so it would be easier to set this up at the same time we are updating the room. I could use the same microphones for both audio conferencing and videoconferencing if we do them at the same time.  A ? The current need does not require the ability to teleconference from this room.

3.	In 3.a. the switch does not apply since the screen is a rear projector screen is stationary and is made of a ridged material.  A ? This is a statement, not a question, no answer required.

4.	They are asking for an Integrated Power Amp with a Ceiling Microphone array and 4 ceiling speakers. What type of microphone array are they asking for. I have used some ceiling boundry microphones that work well in this type of application. I believe they would work better. They already have 8 ceiling tile speakers in the room. Are you planning on replacing these with the 4 speakers mentioned or are they adding 4 additional speakers?  A ? SOW has been revised to address this.


Contractor No. 5:
1.	Who is responsible for taking non-operational equipment from existing rack to make room for new?  Vendor or DDOO?  A ? The government will be responsible for this.

2.	Is existing projector being used or should new be quoted?  A ? SOW has been revised to state that the Mitsubishi projector will be used/integrated with the new system.

3.	Switch/Scaler: what are inputs in addition to DVD/VHS Dual Deck?  A ? SOW has been revised to remove requirement for Scaler and to identify all sources for inputs.

4.	Screen: Synopsis requests installation of new screen.  There is existing framed glass screen.  Should vendor quote new and customer responsible for remodel of wall or utilize existing?  A ? SOW has been revised to address this.

5.	Video Conferencing: synopsis states multi-point capabilities.  Is DDOO host or receiving?  If host, state number of conferees required at one time (this determines codec model required).  A ? DDOO is receiving.

6.	Synopsis states VTC to be installed in adjoining room with remote access on table in conference room.  This suggests codec in adjoining room, camera(s) in conference room.  Is this correct?  If no, please explain.  A ? SOW has been revised to address this; otherwise this would depend on what equipment the contractor recommends.

7.	VTC Camera(s): should be located in conference room for viewing of far-end recipients of conference room attendees.  Should vendor quote single or multiple cameras?  If single VTC Camera, focus should be on lectern or conference table?  A ? SOW has been revised to address this.

8.	Ceiling Mic array: what areas in conference room should be considered ? lectern, conference table, rear room seating?  A ? SOW has been revised to state that microphones must provide sufficient coverage for the entire conference room.

The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this RFQ to a responsible offeror using the lowest price technically acceptable process.  Quotes shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotes meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:  Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement and Factor 2 ? Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a ?go/no go? basis.  If a quote has been determined to be a ?go? on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror?s past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quote and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its quote evaluated for the lowest price.
Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of descriptive literature that clearly indicates what the offeror is proposing and will be providing all products in accordance with the stated characteristics in the Scope of Work (SOW).  ?Descriptive literature? means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quote.  Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered meet the specifications in the SOW.  The information is required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  
                                              
Factor 2 ? Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offeror?s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror?s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror?s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror?s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quote will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

Offerors must submit a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3 OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS with the price offer, or may complete the representations and certifications on the internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.
