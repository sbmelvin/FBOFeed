<DESC>The General Services Administration intends to negotiate a sole source award for Code 2732 of SPAWAR System Center San Diego to Eclipse Electronic Systems, Incorporated.  The contractor shall provide the following: R3000 VMEbus Tuners (quantity = 2). 

SSD-SD Code 2732 has been tasked to build receiver systems for the Distant Sentinel Program.  The Distant Sentinel is a satellite receiver that is being developed.  It is current in the research and development phase, but will soon be moved to the production phase.  Under this program SSC-SD has previously purchased 6 single-board VERSA module Eurocard (VME) dual-channel receiver.  Each receiver must have an input range between 100 to 500 MHz, high tuning resolution and an IF bandwidth of 10 MHz.  

SPAWAR?s belief that only Eclipse Electronic Systems, Inc. can fulfill the requirements of this task order are based upon the following: These are custom boards that are manufactured by Eclipse.  They are proprietary.  Eclipse has manufactured the other boards that are in the system.  The boards, which are the ?heart? of the system, must be an exact duplicate or the system will be inoperable.  

The SIC Code is 3571 and the NAICS Code is 334111. All interested parties must submit a capability statement that sufficiently describes their qualifications and previous experience relevant to fulfilling the above requirement.  Capability statements shall include evidence that the firm has previous experience in providing this requirement.  Please provide the statements via e-mail only to joe.pechinko@gsa.gov by August 8, 2002; 4:30 p.m. Local Pacific Time.  This notice is not a solicitation nor is it a formal Request for Proposal.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In the absence of responses from firms that believe they have the capability to provide these services, GSA intends to negotiate with Eclipse Electronic Systems, Inc., P.O.

<DESC>The General Services Administration intends to negotiate a sole source award for Code 2732 of SPAWAR System Center San Diego to Synergy Microsystems.  The contractor shall provide the following: DSP VME - Quad PPC - 7400 @ 366 Mhz p/n DSP/VSS4-QA36QS-FXPBSNA3 (quantity = 4).

SSC ? SD Code 2732 has been tasked to build receiver systems for the Distant Sentinel Program (satellite receive program).  Under this program SSC-SD requires a single-board Array Processor system. ( An array processor is a mini computer with four (4) processor chips integrated for greatly enhanced processing speed.)  The intended use of the board is to perform signal processing, system control, and interface for the Distant Sentinel system.   The board must utilize a VME64 (VERSA module Euro card) interface and provide enough processing power for highspeed DSP (Digital Signal Processing) algorithmic computations.  

SSC-SD requires an Array Processor system that consists of two SCSI interface ports, two RS-232 Serial interfaces, an Ethernet 10/100 Base-T interface, and a PCI Mezzanine interface.  The Array Processor must meet the performance minimum of 3.5 GFLOPS and support the LINUX operating system.  The board?s physical dimensions must be compatible with the VME back plane and comply with chassis volume restrictions.  Synergy Microsystems is the only manufacturer who produces a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Array Processor board that satisfies the Distant Sentinel processing, size, and interface requirements.   The VSS4VME Quad PPC 750 DSP and Array Processing board meets all the unique requirements for the Distant Sentinel Program.  The VSS4 board provides four super scalar PowerPC 750 processors performing at 3.7 GFLOPS.  The VSS4 board provides all of the necessary interface requirements including the VME bus interface as well as supporting the LINUX operating system.  This justification warrants the use of the VSS4VME Quad PPC 750 DSP and Array Processing board.  

The SIC Code is 3571 and the NAICS Code is 334111. All interested parties must submit a capability statement that sufficiently describes their qualifications and previous experience relevant to fulfilling the above requirement.  Capability statements shall include evidence that the firm has previous experience in providing this requirement.

<DESC>The General Services Administration intends to negotiate a sole source award for Code 2732 of SPAWAR System Center San Diego to AP Labs.  The contractor shall provide the following: P/N: FS-1207-sf-02-8005, Recurring FS-1207 M3 rugged 3 slot VME 84X chassis, with slides, optional mounting ears and complete wiring of enclosure. (quantity = 2).  Product specifics are the following: The sub rack assembly is a custom design which houses a card cage with three slots for 6U X 160mm VME64X cards and two removable hard drives, all accessible and removable at the front panel. The chassis assembly is of rugged design and construction to perform in a field environment and meets stringent volume requirements.  The front panel has removable mounting flanges to allow a shipping volumetric envelope measuring 5 ? X 17 X 22 inches.  It is equipped with an international AC voltage power supply that provides +3.3VDC, +5VDC, and ?12VDC per VME64X requirements at the required current and power levels.  Cooling fans maintain sufficient airflow to allow operation in an ambient temperature of 50?C.  A sensor, an audible alarm and a warning light (LED) provide indication of a high-temperature condition. These requirements dictate that the chassis have a custom design. AP Labs can fulfill the requirements of this task order are based upon the following: The supplier provided the chassis for the first generations Communication Sub rack Assembly, 0204911-1, and successfully demonstrated having the engineering capability and the manufacturing and assembly facilities to fabricate the required chassis and to provide card cages, back planes and power supplies that conform with VME64X standards.  Because of basic design requirements that apply to the first and this, the second, generation, the configuration of this assembly?s chassis does not conform to any other existing commercially available design.  AP Labs is the only company that has been found to have an engineering staff and complete facilities to fabricate the chassis in-house and to have VME64X back planes in the required size. The SIC Code is 3571 and the NAICS Code is 334111. All interested parties must submit a capability statement that sufficiently describes their qualifications and previous experience relevant to fulfilling the above requirement.  Capability statements shall include evidence that the firm has previous experience in providing this requirement.

<DESC>The Broadcasting Board of Governors/International Broadcasting Bureau (BBG/IBB) has a requirement for a contractor to obtain quantitative data on the impact of Radio SAWA in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirate using the "Test Program for Certain Commercial Items" specified in Subpart 13.500 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  Pursuant to FAR 12.603, the following constitutes both the synopsis and the solicitation:  (i)  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; written proposals are here in being requested, and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  (ii) The solicitation number for this procurement is CON-02-0025 and this solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  (iii)  incorporated provisions and clauses incorporated into this solicitation document are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-007.Title 48, May 15, 2002.  (iv)  The Contracting Officer has found and determined that the nature of the services to be performed are appropriate for an "unrestricted" procurement in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.502 entitled "Setting aside acquisition".  (v)  The contract line item is as follows: Item 1.  Quantitative data on the impact of Radio SAWA in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.   The assessment shall be performed by conducting surveys of the adult populations in each country.  Research specifications are as follows:  Nature of Surveys:  Audience data shall be obtained through surveys of the UAE and Kuwait.  In the case of the UAE, the survey shall cover the Emirates of Dubai and Abu Dhabi only.  Both surveys should begin in October, 2002, with precise dates to be agreed upon by IBB and the contractor.  The surveys shall be designed to measure the size and composition of the audience for Radio SAWA programming and other domestic and international radio and television broadcasters.   Both surveys will also collect basic information on the overall media usage patterns and attitudes of the population of interest.  The interviewing shall be conducted face-to-face and in the home of the respondent by a trained interviewer. 1)  General Responsibilities of Contractor.   The contractor shall be responsible for the project design, translation, formatting, pretesting, adaptation, and printing of IBB supplied questionnaires; developing the sampling plan; training interviewers; supervising fieldwork; cleaning and encoding survey responses; entering and processing the data; ascertaining the representativeness of the sample and weighting the data, if necessary; preparing cross-tabulations in data books; submitting data on diskette; and communicating all necessary information and results to IBB in a timely manner. 2) Sample Design.  Interested quoters are herein requested to submit price quotations for surveys in each country, each with a samples of 1,500 adults age 15 or older and  fully representative of the population of Kuwait and of the Emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  Because Radio SAWA is aimed at a youthful audience, residents under the age of 30 shall be over sampled so that they represent two thirds (or 1000 cases) of the achieved sample of 1500.  In both countries, only citizens and expatriates from other Arab countries shall be interviewed.  Non- Arab expatriates shall not be included in the survey universe.  Weights shall be derived and applied to the survey data by the contractor in order to correct for the age imbalance resulting from the oversampling of younger respondents as described above and, if necessary, to bring the sample into conformity with the other characteristics of the entire populations of the survey universe in each country.  The sample shall be drawn using recognized probability methods, all the way down to the selection of the individual respondent at the household level.  Only one individual per household shall be selected, and at least three attempts shall be made to interview selected respondents before substitution is allowed.  A detailed Sampling Plan, including stratification criteria, description of the sampling frame, listing of anticipated Primary Sampling Units (PSUs), approximate number of interviews in each, procedures for selecting households within PSUs, and procedures for selecting individual respondents at the household level, shall be submitted to and approved by IBB prior to commencement of fieldwork.   3) Questionnaire.  IBB will supply a set of questions for an interview of approximately 30 minutes consisting of approximately 50 questions (in English), up to 5 of which may be open-ended.   The questionnaire will be provided in draft form for suggestions and comments by the contractor. Following receipt of the contractor's comments, IBB will provide a final version of the questionnaire for translation by contractor into Arabic.  The contractor shall prepare translation of the questionnaire in Arabic and shall submit these translations to IBB for approval prior to pre-test.  The contractor shall be responsible for compiling a comprehensive list of both local and international broadcast media available in the areas to be surveyed.  This information shall be used to compile a precoded list of stations on the survey and shall be submitted to IBB for approval prior to finalization of the questionnaire.

<DESC>NA The Army Environmental Policy Institute intends to negotiate with Natural Strategies , Oakland CA as the only source that can provide the technical support and respond to the overarching purpose of this action order which is to explore the strategic applic ation of ecological footprint analysis (EFA) and environmental management systems (EMS) in support of a transformation to sustainable installations and operations within the U.S. Army. It is intended to demonstrate and validate a “proof of principle” – i.e . the efficacy of integrating sustainability as the “compass” for EMS, as well as applying EFA to guide strategic planning and investments. Specifically, this action order focuses on how best to implement ISO 14001 EMS standards in support of the sustainab le installations concept, and applies EFA to identify opportunities for strategic investment (asking, for example, which installation components and/or activities have the greatest “footprint” and which may provide the greatest opportunity for improvement) , while also providing a composite indicator whereby the U.S. Army can track progress over time. Furthermore, this purchase order provides training opportunities and practical experiences for Army personnel on the application of leading analytical approach es and management systems to identify environmental aspects and impacts that may prove significant enough to warrant management action and continual improvement to facilitate an evolution or transformation to more sustainable installations and operations.

<DESC>This is a research project intended to  demonstrate existing technology under field conditions.  There is no intent in this project that will allow for the development of technology.  <P> The maturity method for measuring concrete strength produces an estimate of strength based on the actual temperature history experienced by the concrete in place. As such, the maturity method attempts to address the differing hydration rates experienced by test specimens compared to the concrete in place. The maturity method requires development of a strength-maturity relationship that is specific to the mixture. Application of maturity has been increasing and certain state agencies have made it a standard test for determining when to open concrete highway pavement to public traffic. Use of maturity in the airport environment has been limited. Potential benefits to the airfield concrete pavement industry includes:  <P> Decreasing time to open critical areas to traffic (such as intersections, runway ends and full panel replacement),  Shortening the time between staged paving operations,  Improving joint sawing operations,  Reducing the number of strength tests, and  Improving reliability of acceptance techniques through testing in-place material.  Conventional use of maturity testing requires a maturity index value (also called a time-temperature factor, or TTF) or an "equivalent age" value to be read from a maturity meter and/or calculated from a time-temperature profile. This maturity index value (or equivalent age) must then be compared to the established strength-maturity relationship curve to convert it to a strength value. Technology is on the edge of being able to automate this conversion and provide information in units that a contractor or engineer can understand in real time.  <P> The primary limitation of conventional maturity measurement stems from the need to convert the temperature readings from embedded thermocouples, or the degree-hours (i.e. TTF) units from maturity devices, to strength values. <P> Instructions for the submittal of proposals for this demonstration project can be found at www.iprf.org and follow links for Project 4. <P>

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has a need to develop a two-day training course on that presents the configuration management (CM) issues and recommended practices for agencies to consider in the planning, development of plans, and preparation for the actual management of travel, control of traffic, and provision of services related to traffic management systems.  CM is the practice of handling changes systematically so that a system maintains its integrity over time. CM involves the policies, procedures, techniques and tools to: manage, evaluate proposed changes, track the status of changes, and to maintain an inventory of system and support documents as the system changes.  CM programs and plans provide the technical and administrative direction to the development and implementation the procedures, functions, services, tools, processes and resources that are required to support a traffic management system.  		

The need for and use of CM plans has increased significantly because of the rapid deployment of ITS projects and the development of traffic management systems.  Many agencies are unaware of the need for, importance, and value of CM programs and plans to the continued operation and maintenance of their systems.  CM standards and recommended practices have been developed and are being used in other industries to successfully plan, design, implement, manage, and maintain complex systems similar to traffic management systems.

The document titled CM for Traffic Management Systems will serve as the technical reference for this course.  The complete draft of this document will be available in August of 2002 with a final version available in the November of 2002.  Individual chapters were made available starting in June of 2002.  This course will be consistent with and follow the structure of the material contained in this document.

There are four Statements of  Work (SOWs) attached to the draft RFP to be used for the issuance of Task Orders against the Basic Contract.  Two of the SOWs will be selected to request cost proposals during the source selection process.  The cost proposals will be evaluated for cost realism.  The cost proposals will be negotiated after award of the basic contract.  All four of the SOWs will eventually be used to issue Task Orders on the new contract.  Cost proposals on the remaining two SOWs will be requested after award of the basic contract. 

There will also be a list of three to six competency questions to help determine technical capability and comprehension of the Statement of Objectives (SOO) attached to the final RFP.  The questions shall be answered by each Offeror during their oral presentation.  The following is a sample question:

	?Describe methods for measuring laser beam divergence in a military laser range finder including equipment model numbers to accomplish the task.  Assume that the beam divergence is known to be less than 0.5 mrad, but greater than 10 &#61549;rad and that the laser operates at 10 Hz.  The measurement will be conducted at the manufacturer site with equipment provided by the AFRL/HEDO measurement team and must therefore be easily transportable.?

The list of Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) with Data  (DID) numbers are attached.  The CDRLs will be attached when completed.  The DID information can be found at the following web site: http://assist.daps.mil.

The Site Visit, if required, will be scheduled by the Contracting Officer after the final RFP has been released.
 
Government Purchase Cards (GPC) may be used to fund the Task Orders issued against the basic contract.  A separate GPC will be used for each Task Order.  The procedure of using a GPC for funding will require the awardee of the contract to establish procedures with their financial institution for the acceptance of the GPC.

<DESC>The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings.   The following document describes the Construction Manager As Constructor (CMc) Services Contract for the proposed new United States Courthouse, to be located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and the option for Construction Phase Services.  A Fixed-Price Incentive (Successive Targets) contract under FAR 16.403-2 is contemplated.  The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step (FAR 15.202), and Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures.  For this contract, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price (see FAR 15.101-1 trade offs).    

Project Summary: The proposed new courthouse will be constructed on a site located in downtown Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  The project consists of approximately 246,850 gross square feet (22,935 gross square meters) while containing approximately 166,850 occupiable square feet (15,500 occupiable square meters) to deliver the required program.  Estimated optional construction phase cost range is $50,000,000 to $60,000,000.  Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor. A Construction Manager as Constructor, or CMc, is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner, in this case the General Services Administration (GSA), to provide design review, cost estimating, scheduling and general construction services.  The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the planning, design and construction phases, along with GSA as owner/developer and GSA's selected A-E firm, William Rawn Associates, Architects, Boston, MA, associated with OPN Architects, Cedar Rapids, IA, as architects and engineers of record, as well as other GSA consultants.  (NOTE:  No A-E contract has been negotiated or awarded at this time.)

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to award up to six (6) firm-fixed price contract(s) ($500K each) for concept studies that provide innovative concepts for a focus mission, high speed ship.  NAVSEA expects to issue the solicitation in August 2002 with award expected shortly thereafter.  The period of performance for the studies will be three months.  Participants will be required to address construction of proposed concepts in the United States. The ship is envisioned to be a networked, agile, stealthy surface combatant.  Its warfighting capabilities should be optimized for versatility in the littorals for anti-access missions against asymmetric threats.  It will rely on mission packages employing organic manned and unmanned vehicles to execute assigned missions and operate as a node in a network centric battle force.  In order to conduct successful missions in an  adverse littoral environment, it must use innovative weapons, sensors, data fusion, C4ISR, hull form, propulsion, optimal manning concepts, smart control systems, and self-defense systems.  Primary missions for the ship are those that ensure and enhance friendly force access to littoral areas.  Primary access-focused missions will include: prosecution of small boats, mine counter measures and littoral ASW.  Secondary missions may include: intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; homeland defense / maritime intercept; SOF support; logistics support for movement of personnel and supplies.  The results of these concept studies may be used by the Navy to support requirements development, technology needs identification, and program planning for further development of a future ship design.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), PMW-179, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a contract modification with Titan Systems Corporation, 3033 Science Park Road, San Diego, CA 92121 that will expand the scope of contract N00039-00-C-3204. With this modification, the scope of work under contract N00039-00-C-3204 will be expanded to include a software upgrade to the Miniaturized Demand Assigned Multiple Access (Mini-DAMA) Communications Set to implement the latest UHF 25-kHz TDMA/DAMA SATCOM technology (MIL-STD 188-183A), data control mode (MIL-STD 188-184, 184A) and Mini-DAMA Visual Interface (MDVI). Titan Systems is the only known source with the technical data and expertise to perform this software upgrade on the MINI-DAMA terminal. The software upgrade will provide additional functionality and capabilities to the MINI-DAMA terminal.  Among these upgrades are substantial increases of the achievable data rates for UHF SATCOM and the addition of a data control, which provides data compression, packet communications, and adaptive error correction processing.  In addition, these upgrades will provide for an improved uplink path, assured UHF coverage at higher data rates and maximize use of channel bandwidth for improved performance at lower data rates. These Mini-DAMA software upgrades meet the baseline IT-21 requirements and assure compatibility with incoming systems such as DMR and JTRS. SPAWAR anticipates the work under this modification will be on a firm-fixed price basis with a period of performance of one (1) year.  The contractor will be required to demonstrate efforts to provide subcontracting opportunities for small businesses. The Government is not soliciting proposals in response to this synopsis. It is the policy of the Government to foster competition, any prospective offeror may provide information, which the Government will consider in it's continued review of the requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334290. Points of contact for this requirement are Mark Lopez, Contracting Officer, (619)524-7168, mark.lopez@navy.mil and Stephen Beckner, Contract Specialist, (619)524-7389, Stephen.beckner@navy.mil See Government-wide Numbered Note 22.

<RESPDATE>083002
<ARCHDATE>09292002
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Nancy Sterling, Contract Specialist, 858-537-0421; Pamela F Kibler, Contracting Officer, 619-524-7192
<DESC>The U.S. Navy Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWARSYSCOM) conducted a study of future Ka Band commercial satellite communications systems in 1998-1999, and solicited information from industry during that timeframe. SPAWARSYSCOM is updating and expanding the information obtained during that study and is once again seeking information on achieving new military satellite communications (SATCOM) capabilities using systems operating in the Ka/Ku frequency band. Although the military anticipates that the Ka/Ku band services may not be operational until calendar year 2005 or later, the need for pre-planning is recognized to take advantage of the commercial marketplace and to allow for the time required to implement the appropriate contractual vehicle(s). Accordingly, the purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to assess the capability and features of industry's current and emerging Ka/Ku-band commercial SATCOM systems to meet the future requirements of the Navy. This assessment will help the Navy understand and assess the future wideband SATCOM architecture options in meeting both government and commercial SATCOM needs. It is anticipated that future military requirements would include both Fixed and Mobile Satellite Services (FSS/MSS) utilizing WRC-allocated portions of the 12.7 to 31.0 GHz commercial and military satellite frequency spectrum, and would consist of circuit bandwidths on the order of one to many megabits per second. The military's use of wideband SATCOM could include services such as: imagery transfer, video teleconferencing, command and control systems information exchange, tele-medicine, trunked voice circuits, and large file transfer.  Information regarding the following technical aspects of existing or planned commercial Ka/Ku-band SATCOM systems is requested: system architecture technical description (space, terminal and ground segments); geographic coverage to include the polar regions and open oceans; services offered (voice, video and data); user capacity; data rate symmetry/asymmetry capabilities; bandwidth on demand features; network management and control; system security; system vulnerabilities (jamming, interception, geolocation, user surges); and available terminal equipment (MSS and FSS)for ground, air, and shipboard application. Additionally, information regarding business and regulatory aspects is requested including: current/anticipated cost for usage; program status and schedule; status of FCC/WRC filings; launch dates; consortiums and/or partnerships and the division of responsibilities; up-to-date business plans, and company profiles.  SPAWARSYSCOM also requests that respondents describe possible investment opportunities that could secure incorporation of Navy-unique requirements on commercial systems.  If any information is considered proprietary it MUST be so marked to be protected by the Government as such.  All replies should not exceed 20 pages. An original and five copies should be submitted no later than 2:00 PM Pacific Daylight Time on 30 August 2002 to SPAWARSYSCOM, Attn: Nancy Sterling Code 02-23H, OT#4 Room 1042, 4301 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92110-3127. Submissions will not be returned.  One-on-one meetings may be scheduled after the Government reviews the information received in response to this announcement.  Please also include in your response whether or not you desire to participate in such a meeting and the name and telephone number of your point-of-contact responsible for scheduling the meeting. This request for information is not a formal solicitation.  The Government will not award a contract on the basis of this request for information or responses received, nor will it pay for the information requested herein. Questions in regard to this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail only to sterling@spawar.navy.mil and kibler.pamela@navy.mil Verbal questions will not be accepted.  Questions will be answered via posting answers to the SPAWAR Business Opportunities Page; accordingly, questions shall NOT contain proprietary information. Th e Government does not guarantee that questions received after 14 August 2002 will be answered.

<DESC>The METOC Systems Program Manager, PMW 155, his staff and other offices at SPAWARSYSCOM need an independent, objective, technical assessment of the nuclear, chemical, biological and radiological (NCBR) contaminants to support of integrated modeling and simulation for Joint and Air Force Chemical and Biological Defensive Assessments. The NCBR contaminants assessed must constitute the most debilitating saltwater-borne threats to U.S. Naval forces; the sensors that can detect these waterborne NCBR contaminants; and, the inventory of operational and quasi-operational shallow saltwater particulate dispersion models.  The identified sensors and models could become candidates for eventual use by the Department of Defense to detect NCBR contaminants in shallow saltwater domains and predict the transport and fates of these toxic contaminants for Force Protection and Consequence Management purposes.

<DESC>Fleet & Industrial Supply Center Puget Sound (FISCPS) intends to procure "Tube Lox" Scaffolding in support of Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on a sole source basis from Patent Construction Systems, Harsco Corporation, 1 Mack Centre Dr, Paramus NJ 07652. This procurement is sole source based on the requirement for the materials to be used with the extensive current inventory of Patent's "Tube Lox" scaffolding equipment.  Introduction of alternate scaffold products would be incompatible with the existing scaffolding.  Due to the unique nature of each manufacturer's scaffolding, intermixing different manufacturer's products poses a serious safety hazard. In fact, CFR 1926.451(b)(10) states, "Scaffold components manufactured by different manufacturers shall not be intermixed unless the components fit together without force and the scaffold's structural integrity is maintained by the user. Scaffold components manufactured by different manufacturers shall not be modified in order to intermix them unless a competent person determines the resulting scaffold is structurally sound." In the past, the Government has used MIL-S-29180B "Scaffolding Components, Steel, Tube and Coupler" to procure tube and clamp scaffolding.  The products received by PSNS when ordered to this Mil-Spec do not consistently intermix properly with the existing scaffolding equipment. PSNS has submitted recommended changes to the Mil-Spec to NAVSEA for review, testing and approval, with the desire to provide for future competitive procurements.  The resulting contract will be a firm fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity supply type contract. The period of performance is from date of award through one year thereafter.  FOB Destination at PSNS Bremerton WA. The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No telephone requests will be accepted. Requests may be submitted via fax to (360) 476-8701 or an email to julie_a_thomas@puget.fisc.navy.mil.

The Collection Delivery Vehicle project uses two WVME-163 sidle-board computers as part of a vehicle navigation and control system.  Over seven years of effort has been expended integrating hardware that interfaces with these computers and developing software that executes on these computers. If a different single-board computer were procured, additional hardware redesign and software integration would add substantial cost ot the program in the form of several work years of effort and schedule delay.  Use of different computer would also preclude their use as spares on the current vehicles.  To minimize costs, meet scheduling requirements and provide sparing capability, it is prudent to purchase the additional VME computers from Bill West, Inc.

<DESC>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) on behalf of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Center for Information Technology (CIT) Division of Customer Support intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The Gartner Group, McLean, Virginia, for continuation of existing services to support a wide range of computer and telecommunication resources to a community of over 60,000 customers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and other federal agencies.  The Gartner Group has supplied access to its database of published IT research to HHS for the last seven years.  In addition, HHS has acquired expert IT technical services.  The Gartner Group has gained knowledge and understanding of the systems and infrastructures unique to HHS and NIH.  CIT seeks access to published IT Research and to other IT technical services from a vendor with expert understanding of the HHS mission and objectives of each of the HHS OP/DIVs and STAFF/DIVs.  HHS/NIH requires access to Gartner Groups proprietary database of published IT Research to continue making informed decisions and setting realistic programmatic objectives in IT.  Gartner offers a comprehensive body of global research that reports on and analyzes the technologies that drive business and organizational success.  The more than 200 research topics include customer relationship management (CRM), business-to-business e-commerce, supply chain management, wireless, emerging technologies, security, IT services, e-business, and IT spending and strategies.  Because Gartner does not implement technology solutions, they provide independent analysis services for technology assessment and procurement, project development, measurement, and technology management such as total cost of ownership, CRM, IT spending recommendations and hundreds of customized programs.  Gartner also develops and executes industry-wide studies sponsored by multiple clients seeking benchmarking and deliverables that often set the standards for marketing and measuring emerging technologies.  Work will be performed off-site at awardees facilities and on-site at HHS specified locations.  The period of performance is anticipated to be for a base year and two option years.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Commercial Items Acquisition.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available; however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NIH.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the referenced services as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposals must include pricing information.  NLM Synopsis No. NLM 02-180-LHS.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Linda H. Shariati, Contracting Officer, NLM on (301) 496-6546 or by email at sharial@mail.nlm.nih.gov.

This effort includes parallel and concurrent monitoring of the IPIAs, DAPIAs and the 37 participating State Administrative Agencies (SAAs), and issuing and accounting for certification labels and fees.  Through this solicitation, HUD seeks to identify a contractor with the qualifications, commitment, expertise, and experience to provide quality analyses and recommendations for various functions of the Department's manufactured housing regulatory program.

The IPIA monitoring tasks require performance observation of third-party inspection agencies (IPIAs) that perform in-plant inspections of each home under construction and review notification and correction plans.  The DAPIA monitoring tasks require the contractor to assist HUD in tasks required to evaluate the performance of design approval agencies and provide recommendations to HUD on related aspects of the program.  The SAA monitoring tasks are to assist HUD in monitoring and verifying that the 37 SAAs handling manufactured housing related consumer complaints for HUD are performing satisfactorily.  Miscellaneous support and auxiliary services will be detailed under principal task sections of the SOW.  These items include training and assistance, alternative construction reviews, analysis of technical issues, accounting for fees, and label controls.

The applicable NAICS code is 561110 and the size standard is $6.0 million. The period of performance for this contract will be a 24 months base period with two 12 months option periods, if exercised.

The RFP release date is expected to be on or about August 14, 2002.  The RFP will only be provided through HUD's web page as discussed below.  Interested parties may obtain a copy of the solicitation by accessing the following web page: 
http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpo/contract.cfm

HUD posts all required notices of its contracting opportunities on its Internet Contracting Opportunities site at the above website.  Potential offerors who download copies of solicitations from HUD's Contracting Opportunities site will NOT automatically receive any amendments to those solicitations. You are advised to check back frequently to see if HUD has issued any amendments to solicitations you have obtained. All amendments will be posted on, and may be downloaded from, HUD's Contracting Opportunities site.

It is anticipated that a cost-reimbursement contract will be made for this requirement, based on the best value to the Government.  However, the Government may solicit some items on a fixed-price basis.

<DESC>NASA/HQ plans to extend Contract No. NASW-98010 entitled "NASA Student Involvement Program (NSIP) Support" for NASA Headquarters, Code JE, Washington, DC, with TERC, Inc., for ten months from the period September 1, 2002 through June 30, 2003.  This extension will provide continued performance during the interim period until a new Cooperative Agreement can be awarded.  It is anticipated that the Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) will be posted in November 2002 to all interested parties and that a follow-on 5-year Cooperative Agreement will be in place by June 30, 2003.  The statutory authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Agency's requirements.  TERC is uniquely qualified to perform this interim requirement without unacceptable delays to the Government, due to its current involvement in this project.  TERC is the only source with an established infrastructure which can carry out the program for the 2002/2003 school year.  Any other source would need to have an infrastructure in place to manage the continued development of the program, coordination with NASA, and publicity and distribution of materials by August/September 2002.  See Numbered Note 22.  The focus of the NSIP is to develop student involvement program(s) that offer unique educational opportunities/experiences for participating students by providing: (a) an understanding of and doing scientific inquiry utilizing NASA missions and facilities; (b) hands on learning opportunities using the scientific process to work with emerging technologies; and (c) mentoring and more direct involvement by NASA scientists, engineers, and educators with students and the competitive process.  In addition, NASA/HQ would like to enhance the program incorporating (1) Programs modeled and built upon the philosophy and framework of science, mathematics, technology, and geography standards; (2) Competition designed to articulate education standards in order that teachers can better implement the processes into existing curricula; (3) Promote greater correlation and currency to NASA's Enterprises and their missions; (4) Increased emphasis on team involvement to facilitate students assimilating the workplace environment and experiences as early as possible while still maintaining individual excellence; (5) Increased student diversity and inclusion of additional students by incorporating K-2 into the program; (6) Incorporate multimedia opportunities into the competition process; (7) Increase "active" learning as part of the competitive process involving higher level thinking skills, e.g., research, design, develop, construct, test, analyze and redesign; (8) Increase and encourage student participation at regional symposia; and (9) Incorporate a more rigorous program evaluation process.  In order to keep the program current, exciting and challenging, the goal is for student research projects to incorporate such "challenging" areas as: The solar system, flights (e.g., space shuttle - space experiment module (SEM)), Suborbital Rockets - Sub-SEM, International Space Station (ISS), KC-135, Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), balloons, Earth System Science, Art/Communication/Multimedia, Personal Computers, Aeronautics & Atmospheric Flight (e.g. computer modeling), Payload packaging/launch/deployment,  Propulsion,  Robotics, Space Science, Micro-gravity (e.g. drop tower),  Life Sciences and Astrobiology.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number RFQ-026-4384-02 is issued as a request for quotations and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through FAC 01-07.  This procurement is set aside for small business.  The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 334516.  For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business size standard is 500 employees. USDA, ARS has a need for a liquid chromatography system to purify enzymes and proteins from plant tissues such as developing soybean seeds and leaves, and to purify synthetic peptides produced in the laboratory.  This system must include the following characteristics: 1. Ability to perform separations based on a variety of sample characteristics, such as molecular weight, net surface charge, and hydrophobicity, while retaining biological activity (in the case of enzymes). 2. Depending upon the column used, flow rates may range from 0.05 to 20mls/min at pressures ranging from 0-700 psi. 3. The system must be capable of generating very precise, shallow gradients.  In most cases, this requires a  two-pump gradient system with dynamic mixing. 4. The entire wetted flow path of the system must be inert to halides.  5. The system pumps should allow operation of the system at zero backpressure to ensure compatibility with standard low pressure chromatography supports often used in affinity chromatography. The system must also have a definable pressure limit system, which will stop the pump and generate an audible and visual warning, in the event pressure exceeds the preset limit. 6. The controller must allow programs to be time-based, volume-based, or column-volume based. 7. The system should include a fraction collector which is fully integrated into the system and fully controllable via the system control software. 8. The pumps, UV and conductivity monitors, valves and fraction collector must all be specified for use in a cold room at 4  C. 9.

<DESC>POC:  Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel:  703-875-4357, Fax:  703-875-4009, E-Mail:  ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place  :  Guangzhou Metro Corporation, c/o Mr. Zhang Zhuofan, Guangzhou Metro Consulting Limited, 16/F CTS Centre, 219 Zhong Shan Wu Road, Guangzhou, CHINA 510030, Phone: 86-20-8310-6511, Fax: 86-20-8310-6611  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Guangzhou Metro Corporation.  The feasibility study will outline the technical standards and system requirements for Line 3 of the Guangzhou metro system in the city of Guangzhou, China.  

The proposed Guangzhou Metro Project will expand the existing Guangzhou metro system, allowing the city?s growing population (7.5 million) greater access to environmentally friendly transportation options.  The project is a high-speed light rail project, the first in China, and has the potential to be replicated in other cities.  Currently only five cities in China have metro systems, however it is the goal of the Chinese government to have metro systems in 22 cities in the near future.  The project presents significant opportunities for U.S. exporters who are especially competitive in the fields of fare collection, fire prevention systems, train control systems, and signaling.

Guangzhou currently has a two line metro system (one in operation and one under construction), which uses some of the latest light rail technology.  The first phase of the 18.5 km Line 1 opened in summer 1997, and is comprised of 16 stations, the depot, and workshops.  The total project cost for Line 1 was approximately $1.5 billion, including the civil works, which was coordinated by the Guangzhou Metro Corporation.  All but two kilometers of this line have been built underground, so that road traffic, already badly congested, was minimally affected.  The 16 stations of the first line are supported by six interlocking segments, which ensure the safety of the network and the backbone of the signaling infrastructure.

Line 2 is currently under construction and is planned to run from Pazhou, in the south central portion of the city, to Jiangxia in the northwest.  The anticipated cost for the development of Line 2 is $570 million.  It is planned that a portion of the line may be opened by October 2003.  

Line 3 is designed in a ?Y? shape.  The main line will run south from the Guangzhou East Station to Nanhualu.  A branch line will run from Tianhe passenger station to Tiyuxilu station.  The total length of the line will be 35.7 km, with 18 stations and 1 car depot.  Total investment costs are estimated to be nearly $2 billion, with construction scheduled to begin in 2002, and the line scheduled to open in 2005.  After its completion, Line 3 will be the longest in the Guangzhou network.  The line will also be the main connection for high-speed light rail (LRT) lines in the north and south of the city.  In the north, it is anticipated that the yet-to-be-constructed airport express line will link with the Guangzhou Metro Line 3.  In the south, the line will connect with the Nansha light rail line.  

Guangzhou Metro Corporation seeks to hire a Contractor to develop a feasibility study for technical standards and system requirements for Line 3 of the Guangzhou metro system.  The proposed feasibility study will include a detailed assessment of traffic requirements; a technical evaluation of the metro system and its requirements; an economic and financial analysis of the project; an analysis of the probable environmental impact of the project; and an assessment of the equipment needed to carry out the project.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $523,270 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Chinese directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM local time, September 16, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Program Support Center (PSC) has a requirement to obtain a contractor for the Office of the Surgeon General, Department of Health and Human Services to evaluate strategies and practices for the recruitment and selection of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) Commissioned Corps Officers and to provide recommendations for improvement.  The PSC intends to negotiate a fixed price contract on a sole source basis with the PHS Commissioned Officer Foundation, 8201 Corporate Drive, Suite 560, Landover, MD 20785 for this service.  A six month period of performance is anticipated.  Specifically the contractor shall develop a work plan; conduct interviews with Division of Commissioned Corps (DCP) representatives, the 4 Chief Professional Officers and one or more representatives from each of 11 Federal agencies having more than 50 Corps officers; determine the existing Commissioned Officer recruitment and selection efforts/practices of each agency interviewed and deliver a report that addresses the Commissioned Officer recruiting plans/priorities/practices of HHS and non-HHS agencies; deliver a report that determines/evaluates current recruitment/placement outcomes; and deliver a report that provides a description of best practices for recruitment and hiring within the agencies that utilize officers, as well as providing recommended options to improve recruitment and placement efforts/outcomes.  This requirement has been justified in accordance with FAR 6.301-1 Only One Responsible Source.  The PHS Commissioned Officer Foundation, comprised of six retired PHS Officers and one Inactive Reserve Officer, is uniquely poised to conduct this evaluation because of its in-depth knowledge of the various agencies supporting the Corps, the Division of Commissioned Personnel, and all aspects of recruitment and assignment of Commissioned Corps Officers.  The Foundation is currently completing a contract for the DCP on recruitment, specifically working with officers, schools of health professions and in evaluating recruitment materials and practices developed by the DCP. This contract is a logical next step for the Foundation, since it is familiar with the background materials.  Any organization interested in responding to this requirement shall provide a capability statement documenting their knowledge of the subject matter and experience with conducting similar projects relating to the topic.  No solicitation document is available.  Reference Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Applied Research Program (ARP) plans to enter into a sole source contract with Public Health Institute, 2001 Addision Street, 2nd Floor, Berkeley, CA 94703.  This procurement will provide Cross-Cultural Evaluation of California Health Interview Survey (CHIS).  The Applied Research Program (ARP) plans, conducts and supports research related to evaluating the quality of survey questionnaires used for cancer risk factor surveillance.  As part of this mission, the ARP sponsors research intended to develop and evaluate novel forms of questionnaire quality assessment and evaluation.   The current research effort involves the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), a periodic cancer-related health survey conducted by The University of California at Los Angeles, in partnership with the Public Health Institute, and fielded by Westat, Inc.  This project will use the 2003 CHIS as a vehicle for developing a means for assessing the cross-cultural equivalence of survey questions through the application of a technique labeled behavior coding. The project will extend the use of behavior coding to the multi-cultural domain by conducing behavior coding of CHIS interviews across three language groups (English, Spanish and either Chinese or Korean).  ARP staff and collaborators want determine which survey questions appear to present problems in particular languages, indicating where the translated version should be reviewed and modified.  Further, as an initial foray into the area of cross-language and cross-cultural behavior coding, the project will provide valuable information concerning the means by which this practice should be carried out in surveys that include multiple languages.  It is anticipated that an award will be made for a one year base period plus a 6 month option period if exercised by the Government.  The Public Health Institute is the only organization with experience in cross-cultural behavior coding for the CHIS.  The project will be led by Elaine Zahnd, Ph.D., a Senior Research Scientist who has had very significant direct experience in contributing to questionnaire design for the CHIS, and who has previously conducted a feasibility study directly related to the current research initiative.  This is not a request for competitive quotations, however, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement,  it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI research to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on August 14,  2002.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>65 -- Request for Information for the fabrication of eyewear for the Department of Defense
<SOLNBR>N62645-02-R-0019
<RESPDATE>082102
<ARCHDATE>09052002

<DESC>A.  Background
1.0.  The Department of Defense is evaluating an optional business strategy that will divest the Government from the fabrication of eyewear for the Department of Defense (DoD) including certain client organizations, the United States Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, etc.
B.  Purpose of this Request for Information, RFI
1.0.  To evaluate the practicality of this option and to make the best business decision, the DoD requests that the optical fabrication industry provide certain data that the Government will use in a comprehensive business case analysis.  The Government believes that these data are commonly available business data.  If proprietary information is provided, it is the offerors responsibility to mark that information using the standards contained within the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR 3-104).
2.0.  The data required herein will NOT result in the award of contracts for the fabrication of eyewear for the DoD.  These data are for information and planning purposes ONLY.  If the DoD determines that this strategy has merit, solicitations may be issued in accordance with applicable FAR and DoD implementing regulations and instructions.
3.0.  Although the Government will reasonably accept questions from offerors regarding this RFI, no information will be provided regarding divestiture, future planning options or solicitations yet-to-be-issued.
4.0.  The Governments cost of optical fabrication data is not available to industry.
C.  Operational Definitions
1.0.  Afloat/deployed.  Those operational units of the DoD that are either deployed and at sea or deployed OCONUS.  Deployed units may or may not be participating in armed conflicts.
2.0.  CONUS.  The 48 contiguous Continental United States.
3.0.  Customer Return Error Rate:  Finished eyewear that does not comply with either the eyewear prescription or fabrication requirements as described herein.  Errors may be identified by the end user but will always be validated by the Governments clinical professional.  Errors are further defined herein.
4.0.  Finished Optical Job.  A finished optical job includes the cost of the frames, the cost of the lenses, the cost of fabrication, the cost of quality assurance, mailing costs, software costs, and the cost of a standard hard sided protective case for each pair of spectacles.  The offeror shall also include all costs of overhead, profit/fee and any other reasonable expenses to receive requests for eyewear, fabricate that eyewear and return completed eyewear to the requiring medical treatment facility(s) or established eyewear ordering accounts.
5.0.  NOSTRA.  The Naval Ophthalmic Support and Training Activity, Yorktown, VA.  For the purpose of this RFI, the largest central optical fabrication laboratory within the DoD. 
6.0.  OCONUS.  Outside the 48 contiguous Continental United States.
7.0.  OFE.  The DoDs tri-service Optical Fabrication Enterprise.  For the purpose of this RFI, the OFE coordinates all optical fabrication activities for the DoD.  The OFE includes all DoD fabrication laboratories world-wide.
D.  Proposed Process for Fabrication of Eyewear
1.0.  The process described below is notional, based on the Governments need for the business and technical information requested herein.  It offers a framework within which the offeror can reasonably provide the requested business and technical information and IS NOT BINDING ON EITHER THE GOVERNMENT OR THE OFFEROR.  Therefore, in a hypothetical, divested environment operating under firm fixed price contracts with one or more industry source, the Government projects a system as detailed below.
1.1.  The Government (at any of the DoD?s medical treatment facilities or established eyewear ordering accounts) will provide the offeror with an eyewear prescription, the type of frame, and the priority.
1.2.  Eyewear prescriptions will be transmitted to the Contractor using Contractor provided hardware and/or software.  Eyewear prescriptions will be transmitted to the Contractor using a secure strong encrypted digital method using Contractor provided hardware and or software.  The Contractor will also have the capability to accept up to10percent of orders via FAX, phone, or standard mail/courier services.
1.3.  The Contractor will fabricate the eyewear and produce a finished optical job that meets the Governments quality standards.
1.4.  The finished optical job will be returned to the DoD medical treatment facility(s) in accordance with the Governments priorities for turnaround times.
1.5.  The Government will check the finished eyewear for accuracy and quality.  Upon acceptance, the eyewear will be dispensed to the patient.  If rejected, the Government will return the eyewear for re-work.  Re-work (including the cost of mailing back to Contractor) will be at no cost to the Government.
1.6.  The Contractor will provide a properly executed, itemized summary invoice to the Government not more often than twice each calendar month.
E.  Quality Standards
1.0.  In the spreadsheet titled, DoD Optical Fabrication Pricing Sheet and, specifically on the tab titled, Finished Job (Offeror Quality), the Government requests that the offeror price those line items using the offerors quality standards.  The offerors quality standards are those standards that the offeror typically employs to provide finished optical jobs to their existing customer base.

2.0.  In the spreadsheet titled, ?DoD Optical Fabrication Pricing Sheet? and, specifically on the tab titled, Finished Job (Govt Quality), the Government requests that the offeror price those line items using the Government?s quality standards provided herein.  The Governments quality standards are those standards that it now employs to meet the expectations of the DoD customer.

3.0.  Governments Quality Standards

3.1.  ANSI quality standards applied.  The Governments quality standard strictly adheres to current applicable ANSI (Z80, Z87, Z86) quality standards.   All spectacles that meet or exceed these standards will be stamped with the ?Final Inspected by stamp of the individual performing the inspection.

3.2.  Customer Return Error Rate.  Based on a sample of 432,843 pair of spectacles which match the range and depth of the requirement contained herein, the Government?s customer return rate for the period from 1 July 2001 to 24 July 2002 was 952 pair of spectacles or a 0.2 percent (0.002) lab error rate.  This represents the rate of jobs returned by the customer to the lab for rework.  This is not the labs internal error rate.  This 0.2% customer return error rate is the standard that the offeror shall apply to their pricing to meet the requirements within the spreadsheet titled, DoD Optical Fabrication Pricing Sheet and, specifically on the tab titled, Finished Job (Govt Quality).

3.2.1.  To amplify the definition above, an ?error? is further defined to include the discrepancies such as: Rx sent to the wrong account, Aberration of the lens, Wrong axis OD, OS or OU, Bad frame stock (defective), Wrong frame color, Wrong style temple, Wrong add power, Lens(es) are cocked, Requested prism missing, Lenses are scratched or pitted, Frame burnt, Lens(es) are too big for the frame, Lens(es) are too small for the frame, Lens(es) are flaked, Requested prism has the wrong direction or amount, Lens power is wrong, Wrong segment height, Undesired prism, Frame is broken, Wrong frame size, Wrong segment type, Wrong type or style frame, Lenses are reversed, PD is wrong, Requested UV400 missing, Requested tint missing, Poor bevel placement, Requested base curve wrong, Frame alignment poor, and Lenses or frame damaged in shipment.

3.3.  Delivery Priorities.  The Government?s turnaround times (by priority) are based on historic data.  These data indicate that from 2% to 10% of requests for eyewear require 24-hour turnaround (down pilots, recruit training, etc.), 5% to 40% require 3-day turnaround and 50% to 93% require 7-day turnaround.

F.  Surge Requirements.

1.0.  The Government has recent surge experience with Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm (DS/DS), Operation Enduring Freedom and post-September 11th.  These surge requirements occur across all categories of frames and lenses but are particularly acute in the specific areas of Protective Mask Inserts (PMI) and Sun Tint (N-15) requirements.  As additional detail, the DS/DS data indicates that PMI fabrication increased 379.94% and sun tint workload increased 189.83%.  The DS/DS data also indicates that 43% of eyewear was fabricated and shipped within 48 hours of receipt.  (NOTE:  The Government recognizes that the exact production data may be helpful to the offeror but the actual numbers cannot be released.)  However, the Government MUST have a system in place to accomplish this surge given a less than 7 day turnaround requirement for the vast majority of the work and a maximum 14 day turnaround for the remainder even under non-surge conditions.  If a divested strategy is chosen, empirical Government data shows that the duration of a surge may be: Long (7-10 months), Moderate (3-6 months), or Short (1-2 months).

2.0.  The offeror is free to extrapolate actual surge workload from the FY02 data that has been provided within the Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  However, recognizing that these data are not specific, the Government requests only that offerors provide information on their surge capacity, as detailed in the section herein titled, ?Technical Proposal?.

G.  Business Rules

1.0.  OFFERORS NEED NOT RESPOND TO ALL LINE ITEMS.  The offeror is free to respond to any or all of the line item requirements within the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet titled, DoD Optical Fabrication Pricing Sheet on either/both tabs (Finished Job (Offeror Quality) and Finished Job (Govt Quality)).  The Government does request that the offeror provide a brief rationale for not responding (i.e. not a typical product line, not cost effective given the volume, etc).  This data would be helpful to determine the reasonableness of the Government?s ultimate approach/solution.

2.0.  These data are not binding on either the offeror or the Government.

3.0.  The Government has no additional information that is available at this time.  However, if a solicitation is issued, the Government realizes that additional detail and definitional support will be required.  Offerors are free to propose data, technical, definitional, business or other items that would be needed to competently propose on the Governments requirements.

4.0.  The Government will retain these data as long as necessary to complete its analyses.

5.0.  The Government will make no other use of this data, except for the analyses of the DoDs optical fabrication options.

H.  Proposal Submission Requirements

1.0.  The transmission and receipt of each offerors proposal from/to the Government will be exclusively electronic.  Hand written price proposals, brochures, paper price lists, etc. cannot be accepted because the Government will not be able to meet the deadlines established by higher authorities.  As this proposal has been sent electronically, the Government requires that the offeror?s proposals be received electronically.  They should be submitted to the point of contact below ONLY.  Please contact the point of contact below if there are any questions.

1.1.  Sales/marketing brochures are specifically discouraged.  Do not send samples.  Do not send items that need to be returned to the offeror.  Offerors should not feel compelled to prove either capacity or competence as these issues will be inherent in formal solicitations, if issued.  The Government encourages offerors to present certain sales, marketing or product data during their oral proposals, if they elect that option.

2.0.  Proposals are due by 2:00 EDT on 21 August 2002 to the point of contact below.  Although late proposals do not have the same implications as if this were a formal solicitation, this date has been chosen to meet deadlines established by the Surgeon General of the Navy, the Department of Defense and other budgetary and executive agencies of the President.  Therefore, the Government requests that this deadline be met as reasonably as possible.  Please contact the point of contact below if there are any questions.

3.0.  To supplement (not supplant) the offeror?s electronic data, the Government is willing to schedule time during the week of 26-29 August 2002 to hold oral discussions with offerors.  These oral discussions are completely optional at the discretion of the offeror and, at no cost to the Government.  If the offeror desires to provide an oral proposal, please contact the point of contact listed below to establish a mutually convenient time.

I.  Offerors Proposal

1.0.  Offerors should read and completely understand this document before beginning either their business or technical proposals.

2.0.  Business Proposal.  The Government recommends that offerors:

2.1.  Review the standards for interpreting the pricing requirements.  These standards are contained within the Microsoft Excel? spreadsheet titled, DoD Optical Fabrication Data on the tabs titled, Frame Data, Lens Data, and Tint Data.

2.1.1.  The, FY02 YTD Volume (Oct-Jun) column represents the workload that the offeror shall use for pricing purposes taking into account all expenses and discounts to propose a notional price for a finished optical job.  These numbers represent the Government?s workload from October 1, 2001 through Jun 30, 2002.  The offerer is reminded that references in the spreadsheets to lens volume indicates the per lens volume and not per pair volume.  The Government requests that the offeror indicates their pricing for lenses as per finished and mounted lens pair.

2.1.2.  The MIL-SPEC references, color, eyesize, bridge and, temple data have been provided to offerors as a reference of the range and depth of eyewear that are typically produced by the Government.

2.1.3.  The Vendor or source data for frames has been provided to give offerors an additional reference that can be used for pricing purposes.  The offeror may propose equivalent frame types as long as they meet the standards contained therein.  Offerors are neither required to use the same source nor contact these competitors.

2.2.  Complete the tab titled, Finished Job (Offeror Quality) within the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet titled, DoD Optical Fabrication Pricing Sheet?.  These data should be the offerors notional prices to the Government for each finished optical job (as defined herein) using the offeror?s quality standards.

2.2.1  The data shaded in blue represents the Governments requirement by frame and lens type.  The Government believes that the offeror should be able to use the standards within the Microsoft Excel? spreadsheet titled, DoD Optical Fabrication Data? to provide a notional price to the Government.

2.2.2.  The offeror shall complete the green shaded cells.

2.3.  Complete the tab titled, Finished Job (Govt Quality) within the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet titled, DoD Optical Fabrication Pricing Sheet.  These data should be the offeror?s notional prices to the Government for each finished optical job (as defined herein) applying any premium for a finished optical job that meets the Governments quality standards.

2.3.1.  The data shaded in brown represents the Governments requirement by frame and lens type.  The Government believes that the offeror should be able to use the standards within the Microsoft Excel? spreadsheet titled, DoD Optical Fabrication Data? to provide a notional price to the Government.

2.3.2.  The offeror shall complete the yellow shaded cells.

2.4.  Provide any supporting financial documentation that the offeror believes that the Government needs to understand the offeror?s prices.  Information should be precise, factual and complete, avoiding unnecessary, unrelated, and/or expansive discussions.

3.0.  Technical Proposal. The Government requests that offerors:

3.1.  Provide a brief and general rationale for not responding to all line items as applicable to the offerors data.

3.2.  Provide proposals/ideas of data, technical, definitional, business or other items that would be needed to competently propose on the Government?s requirements if formal solicitations are issued.

3.3.  Provide any information regarding mailing costs that explains the timing and barriers of fabricating eyewear for the United States Army Medical Materiel Command Europe (USAMMCE), Pirmasens Germany; Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu HI; and, to the 16th MEDLOG Battalion, Taegu Republic of South Korea.  If mailing costs are available, the Government requests that the Contractor provide data for mailing 100 finished optical jobs using both the 24-hour and 3-day priority requirements.

3.4.  Provide a brief narrative regarding the offerors capability and/or willingness to manage the surge capability defined herein including capacities, time required to re-tool and, potential barriers to successfully satisfy both the Moderate and Short surge requirements.

3.5.  Provide the method that the offeror uses to transmit and receive eyewear requests from customers ONLY IF:

3.5.1.  The offeror cannot meet the Governments requirements for using a secure, strong encrypted digital method using Contractor provided hardware and or software or,

3.5.2.  The offeror receives more than 10% of orders via FAX, phone, or standard mail/courier services.

3.6.  Provide any supporting technical documentation that the offeror believes that the Government may need to understand the offeror?s proposal.  Information should be precise, factual and complete, avoiding unnecessary, unrelated, and/or expansive discussions.

J.  Evaluation Procedures

1.0.  To provide fair disclosure of the Governments use of these data, offerors are advised that the Government will make comparisons across like business items and among all offerors submitting a response to this RFI.  These data will be compared to the Government?s quality and cost data with particular attention to optical readiness and contingency planning.  While certain cost increases may or may not be justifiable, the Government cannot accept any plan that compromises or has the potential to compromise military optical readiness, current quality standards, current delivery standards (i.e. customer expectations) and/or the DoD?s ability to provide surge or contingency response.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC is hereby soliciting information for potential sources for CO2 accumulator tanks.  An accumulator for CO2 storage will be utilized as a resevoir for the CO2 Reduction Assembly (CRA).  the CRA is used to convert-crew produced CO2 and additionally fed hydrogen (H2) into methane (CH4) and water (H2O).  Maximizing the internal volume of the accumulators is the greatest driver for selection of the accumulators.  Specification "ECLSS CO2 ACCUMULATOR FLYSHEET SPECIFICATION REVISION: B, JULY 25, 2002" is posted concurrently with this synopsis. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice only.

Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota is looking for possible sources that can provide the following type of equipment or items similar to the following description:

Wall mounted winch to be attached at the indoor base swimming pool.  The ? inch nylon rope will run from the winch, down the length of the pool to be hooked to a student in a parachute harness. The parachute harness has a quick release system that will release them from the winch rope.  The winch will have to have enough power to retrieve a 250-pound person through water at 9 feet per second for a distance of 60 feet.  This is to simulate a person impacting the water under a parachute.  The winch will need to have an automatic shutoff in addition to a 30-foot long control cable.  The winch will need to be able to disengage and freewheel so that we can pull the rope back out for the next student in a timely manner.  The winch will need to be mounted on two vertical steel beams about 8 feet off the floor.  All safety issues with grounding and bonding will need to be considered with the motor being located near water.

Any interested parties please contact the Contracting office at (605) 385-1732 Thomas McGovern or (605) 385-1735 Ken Tritsch

<SUBJECT>70 -- Mainframe Processing
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-KC-2002-TSD-02
<RESPDATE>080902
<ARCHDATE>08242002
<CONTACT>Jerry Shead, Contract Specialist, Phone 816-926-6106, Fax 816-926-1782, Email jwshead@kcc.usda.gov
<DESC>This is a Request for Information to locate potential sources for mainframe processing with guaranteed 24 hour/day, 365 day/year processing "up" time for the Farm Service Agency (FSA) - an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The Government Points of Contact (POC) is Dale Carpenter or Delia Downer, at USDA, FSA, 6501 Beacon Drive, Kansas City, Missouri 64133.

 FSA has a need for mainframe processing with zero downtime or 24 hour/day, 7 day/week guaranteed operations. Zero downtime applies to all disk-based FSA mainframe systems that currently use three IBM 390 mainframes.  The majority of these systems are COBOL based batch processes that access many varieties of data structures from VSAMs to Informix or DB2 databases.  Current backups of primary data require about 81,000 tape cartridges.  Migrated data, which consists of data not accessed in the past 45 days and very large data sets, requires about 300,000 tape cartridges.  The standard for new development is Java using IBMs Visual Age for Java for implementation on Websphere.  New messaging systems have been implemented using IBMs MQ Series messaging.

To accomplish these goals, FSA requires:
(1)Disk Storage redundancy (I.E., RAID 1 or RAID 5) for all disk-based data.
(2)Real-time processor fail-over for all local processors.
(3)Remote processor and disk fail-over to occur within microseconds (near real-time) of the primary processor failure.
(4)Telecommunications fail-over to maintain the link between the primary and secondary processing centers.
(5)All levels of fail-over should be relatively invisible to FSA users, I.E., near zero disruption in processing throughput.

The missions of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency (FSA) include stabilizing farm income, helping farmers conserve land and water resources, providing credit to new or disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, and helping farm operations recover from the effects of disaster.  In accomplishing these missions, FSA disburses up to $30 billion annually through the Federal Reserve System.  FSA was set up when the Department of Agriculture was reorganized in 1994, incorporating programs from several agencies, including the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC - now a separate Risk Management Agency - RMA), and the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA). Though its name has changed over the years, the Agency's relationship with farmers goes back to the 1930s.  At that time, Congress set up a unique system under which Federal farm programs are administered locally.  Farmers who are eligible to participate in these programs elect a three- to five-person county committee, which reviews county office operations and makes decisions on how to apply the programs. This grassroots approach gives farmers a much-needed say in how Federal actions affect their communities and their individual operations. After more than 60 years, it remains a cornerstone of FSA's efforts to preserve and promote American agriculture.

<SUBJECT>AFCEA NEW HORIZONS AT ESC SYMPOSIUM: "FORCE TRANSFORMATION THROUGH AGILE ACQUISITION"
<DESC>The Lexington-Concord Chapter of the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association (AFCEA) in participation with the USAF Electronic Systems Center (ESC) is pleased to announce a two-day symposium entitled "New Horizons at ESC"  29-30 October 2002 at the MITRE Corporation, Building S, Bedford, MA. The objective of AFCEA's New Horizons Symposium is to broadcast to industry ESC programs for business development/pursuit, and, as a byproduct, provide information on changes/updates to DOD acquisition strategies.  Because the word of the day throughout DoD is "Transformation of the Force" and ESC is a "Center for C2ISR Acquisition" both are captured within the proposed conference theme, "Force Transformation Through Agile Acquisition". We will get a top level perspective on Transformation objectives and visions from OSD then carry that message forward into implementation perspectives from AF and AFMC, finally focusing on ESC organizations with emphasis on acquisition impacts; how ESC is supporting transformation through agile acquisition (e.g.. the view that agile acquisition would be an enabler for transformation...doing things faster, better, cheaper).  Industry partners are interested in how AF/AFMC, and in turn, ESC are planning to transform its acquisition processes...hence the focus on AF/XI, SAF/AQ and AFMC/TR overviews; more explicitly on how we're transforming our acquisition processes as enabling force transformation. The symposium registration fee is $375 for AFCEA members, $410 for non-members, and $225 for government attendees. For more information including a registration form, visit the Lexington-Concord Chapter web site at http://www.afceaboston.com or contact Ms. Claire Goulet at 781-221-1580 or cgoulet@acsdefense.com .

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis a fixed-price contract with the Pacific Watershed Institute for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this  notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, proposals are not being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is issued as a Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source #AB133F-02-RP-0114/52ABNF-2-00114.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 2001-08 dated 07/29/02. The resulting contract will be a firm-fixed price contract.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990 with a size standard of $5 Million.  This acquisition will be processed under the simplified acquisition procedures.  SCHEDULE: Contract Line Item #0001 -  Furnish, in accordance with the statement of work (SOW) one complete job for a lump sum amount $_____________; Contract Line Item #0002 - Provide necessary Travel/Equipment/Supplies at a not to exceed amount of $11,500. Offerors are required to submit a completed SF-1449, which you may obtain upon request. STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW): 1.0 Basic Concept: Part of the technical work required for recovery planning involves the evaluation of the factors responsible for the original population declines and the factors currently limiting salmon recovery.  Although the Willamette-Lower Columbia-Technical Review Team (TRT) is charged with technical work at the scale of all the listed ESUs in the Willamette/Lower Columbia Recovery Domain, much of the analysis of the factors for decline is expected to occur at the scale of individual populations and watersheds.  Guidance can include an up-front indication of what the TRT will be looking for as it conducts reviews of analyses conducted by other groups.  The WLC-TRT proposed that the best way to illustrate approaches to the factors for decline analyses would be through the development of a few case studies.  The final product of the Lewis River case study is expected to be a report from the entire WLC-TRT describing the factors for decline, the current limiting factors and the potential biological consequences of potential management actions.  The report is expected to produce a list of problems/opportunities both in and outside the watershed ranked by estimated impact on fish populations.  The case study will address all potential factors for decline affecting the populations in the Lewis River (i.e. all "H's" and all life stages).  This statement of work focuses only on freshwater habitat in the Lewis River.  However, freshwater habitat analyses may need to take into account factors operating outside the Lewis River and factors beside habitat operating within the basin (e.g. harvest or hatcheries).  2.0 Services Required: The contractor's role is to conduct the biological and physical assessment of the watershed based on existing data and field work (as time and budget allow) in order to conduct analyses that allow production of the products described below.  At each step of this process, the vendor shall consult with the TRT regarding the direction and methods of the analysis. Since the vendor products are in support of an ultimate WLC-TRT product, the analytical approaches used the vendor must be discussed with the TRT and agreed to by the TRT prior to the initiation of any new component of the work.  2.1 Task 1: The contractor will meet and collaborate with the WLC-TRT to develop a list of assessment products.  Following this meeting, the vendor will develop a matrix of the conservation planning principles and processes.  The contractor will conduct an inventory of existing information, conservation planning efforts, and available environmental data for each watershed including limiting factors analysis and EDT model input and output.  The data will be reviewed and data gaps will be identified.  In addition, the vendor will identify the other groups with technical information operating in the basin.  In collaboration with the WLC-TRT the vendor will convene a workshop to discuss existing data, gather other data, identify issues, and cement relationships.  The NMFS will be responsible for hiring a facilitator for the workshop.  A list will be prepared outlining additional information and analysis that must be conducted in the watershed to provide the technical basis for recovery plan decisions.  2.1.1 The contractor and the WLC-TRT meet and work towards consensus on assessment products. This is a critical first step that will to a large extent define the exact approaches undertaken in completing the Phase 2 and 3 products.  2.1.2 Identify existing data, review and develop matrix of salmon habitat recovery planning principles and processes. 2.1.3 Compare matrix for each subwatershed.  2.1.4 Convene workshop for other groups with technical information operating in the basin. 2.1.5 List further information/actions necessary in each subwatershed (North Fork and East Fork) of the Lewis River watershed to provide the technical basis for developing recovery plans and actions.  2.2 Task 2: Based on the results of Task 1, the freshwater habitat component of the factors for decline analysis will be conducted.  The analysis shall be conducted by the vendor in cooperation with the WLC-TRT.  Appropriate information from local watershed groups, agencies, tribes, and other relevant groups will be incorporated into the analysis. 2.2.1 Evaluate the current status of salmonid populations as determined by the WLC-TRT and listed in the viability document in relation to interactions with other species including exotics. 2.2.2 Assess historical status of habitat as used by salmonids listed in the viability document and other species.  2.2.3 Apply aerial photo interpretation and GIS to identify factors that affect freshwater habitat conditions and provide spatial context for constraints to recovery (GIS staff to be hired by NMFS).  2.2.3.1 Identification of watershed and reach level processes that directly contribute to the condition of habitat for adult and juvenile salmonids.  2.2.3.1.1 Description of historic keywatershed and habitat conditions within each case watershed. 2.2.3.1.2 Description of current keywatershed and habitat conditions within each case watershed. 2.2.3.2 Description of watershed and reach level processes that may influence salmon recovery. 2.2.3.2.1 Identify watershed areas or processes that are functioning appropriately. 2.2.3.2.2 Identify the state of watershed processes that could be limiting recovery. 2.2.3.3 Description of probable or potential root causes of salmon decline in relation to freshwater habitat.  2.2.3.3.1 Eliminate or minimize confounding factors that may be masking the true problems. 2.2.3.3.2 Identify hypotheses concerning cause-effect. 2.2.3.3.3 Select samples for field verification. 2.2.4 Field verification.  2.2.4.1 Do an aerial survey of the watershed to evaluate GIS findings and identify watershed factors contributing to constraints. 2.2.4.2 Field verify samples and measure parameters were necessary, e.g., in a reach identified as aggrading based on aerial photo and GIS analysis, verify if process is occurring, whether it is naturally caused or management induced, measure sediment distribution and degree of armoring (surface and subsurface pebble counts). 2.2.5 List and rank constraints/ limitations of existing information, specific ecosystem processes, critical unknowns, and their impact on fish.  2.2.6 Develop checkpoint questions that can be used for guidance in conducting physical and biological freshwater habitat assessments. 2.2.7 Develop monitoring recommendations and identification of baseline conditions that can be used for long term monitoring of watershed processes and salmonid habitat conditions. 2.3 Task 3:  Based on the experiences gained in Phases 1 and 2, write a report that addresses the following subtasks. 2.3.1 Description of freshwater habitat conditions based on existing data, GIS analysis and field verification (data collected and GIS products will be included as Appendices on CD- ROM). 2.3.2 Constraints and opportunities for recovery in each subwatershed of the Lewis River Watershed from the freshwater habitat perspective. 2.3.2.1 Current habitat conditions as a result of natural and management induced processes (e.g., hydrologic regime, sediment regime, water quality, riparian conditions). 2.3.2.2 Interactions with other species including exotics. 2.3.2.3 Ranking of constraints and uncertainty of existing information, specific ecosystem processes and critical unknowns and their impact on fish. 2.3.3 Monitoring recommendations for watershed and reach level processes. 2.3.4 Guidance for conducting biological and physical assessments including questions and discussion on problems and uncertainty incurred in conducting the Lewis River assessment. 2.3.5 Recommendations for further supportive research and work. 3.0 Deliverables: 3.1Provide compiled data, status reports, a final report, and participate in progress meetings as directed by the NWFSC point of contact and agreed upon by all parties.3.2 The format for the deliverables will be determined by the NWFSC point of contact and communicated to the vendor within a reasonable time frame prior to delivery. 4.0 Performance:  4.1 Place of Performance: Services will be required at various locations in Washington and Oregon as agreed upon by both parties. 4.2 Period of Performance Date of Contract Award through 9/30/03. 5.0 Point of Contact: The Contracting Officer's Technical Representative will be the point of contact for questions, review, and acceptance of submitted work as well as responsible for task and meeting coordination. 6.0 Travel/Materials/Equipment:  These tasks will require travel as determined by both parties.  The contractor will be responsible for all travel arrangements.  Travel costs will be reimbursed in accordance with Government travel regulations. All necessary materials and equipment will be determined and provided by both the NWFSC and the contractor as agreed upon by both parties.  Expenditures shall not exceed the contract amount of $11,500. 7.0 Privacy and Security Confidentiality: Confidentiality of all subjects and materials. Work on this contract may require that personnel have access to Privacy information.

Statement of Work
for
Physical Fitness Facility (Gym) Group Membership
(As of 29 July 2002)

1.	Introduction.
The National Security Space Architect (NSSA) is a federal government organization located at 11242 Waples Mill Road, Fairfax, VA.  The NSSA employees include active duty military personnel.  The Department of Defense requires these personnel to be physically fit.

2.	Program and Performance Objectives
The NSSA requires a physical fitness facility (gym) for the use of its people, at no cost to those people.  The NSSA will purchase a group membership covering 30 people at a Gym within a 1-mile radius of the NSSA Facility.  This group membership will provide the same access to facilities and service that the Gym offers for sale to the general public.

3.	Scope
3.1.	Description of Services

 3.1.1 The Gym will provide NSSA with a group membership   covering 30 people at one time.  The group members will have the same access to facilities and services that the Gym offers to the general public through membership such as locker rooms, towel service, and personal trainers (to be paid for by the individual) .  To meet the minimum needs of DoD personnel for physical fit requirements, the Gym must have available to group members showers, dry saunas, steam rooms, swimming pool, whirlpool, aerobic exercise equipment, strength training equipment, flexibility training equipment, multi-purpose rooms, and classes.  
  		
3.1.2 After the initial assignment of 30 people to the NSSA?s group membership, the NSSA will pay the Gym a transfer fee for every old member replaced by a new member in accordance with the Purchase Order.  The exception to the Gym policy is that the NSSA group membership is limited to total of 30 transfers per year.  A single membership slot may have more than one transfer during the year, but the total number of transfer during the year for the NSSA group membership will not exceed 30.

3.1.3 The Gym will waive its normal 30-day cancellation notice for existing Gym members who will transfer to the NSSA group membership.  Changing private monthly memberships to the NSSA group membership must occur at the beginning of the month, as the Gym will not prorate membership fees for periods less than a month.

3.1.4 When a new person is added to the NSSA group membership, the person will process into the Gym?s membership following the Gym?s normal procedure, except that the Gym will not require any credit card or bank account information.

3.2	Service Delivery Schedule
3.2.1. Service will start on 1 Sep 02.
                  
3.3	Government Furnished Property and Services:  None.

3.4	General Information
3.4.1	Deliverables:  None.
3.4.2	Security:  None.
3.4.3	Period of Performance:  One full year with 2 options years
3.4.4	Place of Performance:  The physical fitness facility
3.4.5	Hours of Operation:  The normal hours of the physical fitness facility. 
   
3.5	Appendices:  None
