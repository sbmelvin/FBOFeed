<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
Document Number: USDA-RFI-NAIP-2008


A.  JPEG 2000 PILOT PROJECT
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency (FSA), Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) plans to conduct a pilot project using the JPEG 2000 compression format on compressed county mosaic (CCM) files for a single state during the upcoming 2008 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP).  The Government is requesting information on recommended compression settings and possible user impacts.

B.  BACKGROUND
The FSA is responsible for administering USDA farm programs including crop commodity price support, disaster relief, and assistance for conservation practices.  FSA administers farm programs in part by digitizing and maintaining agricultural field boundaries, or common land units (CLU) from digital orthoimagery acquired from the NAIP.  Another key aspect of farm program administration is to verify that agricultural practices are in accordance with USDA program parameters.  FSA has performed this verification by using NAIP imagery which is acquired during peak agricultural growing seasons on an annual basis.  The aerial imagery, along with existing program parameters, is viewed in a geographic information system (GIS) at county based USDA Service Centers to show crops and agricultural practices.  The use of NAIP imagery has been successful in providing FSA current orthoimagery for maintaining CLU boundaries and performing farm program administration.  It has also provided participating government agencies with current, accurate orthoimagery for their GIS programs. 

Although the majority of NAIP orthoimagery is currently being acquired and developed in standard RGB format, the program is slowing migrating to 4-band orthoimagery (Red, Green, Blue, and near CIR).  The NAIP contract specifications require the CCMs to be delivered in LizardTech(TM) MrSID(R) compression format which is not fully compatible with 4-band imagery.  Because NAIP imagery is used by many Federal, state, and private users and has become a de facto standard for small scale orthoimagery, APFO would like to define a common compression standard to promote GIS compatibility and minimize potential user impacts.

C.  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
The Government is soliciting responses from industry, academia, and the public regarding the move to JPEG 2000 compression and its potential impacts to imagery providers and end users.  Please respond to the following questions by including feedback on all appropriate topics, such as cost, schedules, and risks.  If you do not have input on a question or statement, please indicate with "not applicable" or "no response".  In addition, please feel free to provide other recommendations or suggestions on possible non-JPEG 2000 compression of multispectral imagery (see Question 7).

Question 1:  What would you consider to be typical JPEG 2000 settings (such as tiling, wavelet, bit rate, quantization, etc.) for a lossless and lossy compression using your software for NAIP end-users?  For example:

  Setting                Lossless            Lossy
  -------------------    --------            -----
  Target compression:         2:1             15:1
  Wavelet;             Reversible   Non-reversible
  Bit depth:                    8                8
  Tiling:                    None               50 (7,500 x 7,500 image)
  Quality layers:              15               15
  Bit rate:                     2              0.5

Question 2:  Would your recommendation differ based on the end use (such as casual viewing, remote sensing, storage, etc)?  
		
Question 3:  Which of these settings do you consider key in developing a common specification?  How would you recommend describing the settings (such as minimum or maximum values, tolerances, etc) when working with multiple vendors and platforms?  Are there any settings that you prefer not to be included in a specification?  How do you advocate image inspection to ensure compliance with these settings?

Question 4:  What file format (such as GeoJP2(TM)) do you recommend for storing geospatial information (such as projection, coordinates, and datum) and other metadata?  Is your recommended file format capable of storing and extracting Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) compliant metadata?  If not, what metadata standard does it support?

Question 5:  Do you know of any JPEG 2000 compatibility or other issues that could impact the NAIP imagery program?  Do any of the settings have potential problems with any commonly used image viewers?

Question 6:  In larger U.S. Counties, NAIP CCMs, at a 15:1 compression, are exceeding 2GB file sizes and may exceed 4GB in the near future as additional bands are added or increase ground resolution is desired.  Do you know of issues with JPEG 2000 handling very large file sizes?   Any special storage or delivery concerns when working with these large images?

Question 7:  Do you recommend any compression format other than JEPG 2000 to meet the multispectral needs of NAIP?  If yes, what are the pros and cons of this alternate format?  Does this format provide an advantage for web-based applications?

Question 8:  What is your definition of lossless - numerical and visual?   

UNIQUE QUESTIONS FOR COMPRESSION SOFTWARE PROVIDERS:
Question 9:  Does your software allow the end user to adjust/change these settings?  If yes, how does the end user adjust the different settings?  If we develop a new "settings" specification, would your software allow the user to program these settings?  

Question 10:  Which encoder library (such as Kakadu, Jasper, etc) do you use and does this library affect the settings?

UNIQUE QUESTIONS FOR SOFTWARE VIEWER PROVIDERS:
Question 11:  Are there any JPEG 2000 settings that cause problems when reading compressed imagery?  Are there any settings that significantly impact performance (such as load time)?

UNIQUE QUESTIONS FOR END-USERS:
Question 12:  Do you currently use NAIP imagery?  What NAIP products? - CCMs, uncompressed tiles, and/or web services?

Question 13:  What primary software package (such as ESRI(R) ArcGIS(TM), Adobe Systems(R) Photoshop(R), etc) do you use to view JPEG 2000 images?  Does the compression format play any part in your viewing software choice?

Question 14:  How important is lossless imagery to your needs?

<DESC>1)	Overview:

The United States Postal Service (USPS) has a need for professional services support in relation with the specification and development of verified subject and visual background information on all aspects of every stamp subject developed and issued.  The purpose of this requirement is to provide visual and textual research in the development of stamp subject, designs and related products.

The USPS is seeking subject related research, visual reference research, photo research for publication, development of written materials for USPS writers, fact verification for all images and text relating to stamp design, information on copyrights, rights of publicity and family sources, including background and contact information, event related research including family capabilities, schedules of special events and background information, negotiation of fees for payment of image rights, text usage and maintenance of online database accessible to USPS, as well as research of trademark, copyright and other rights related to stamp subjects.

This will be a best value procurement with a strong emphasis on costs, and vendor? involvement in previous USPS stamp research is neither a positive nor a negative.

The USPS is looking for a uniquely qualified supplier who has extensive experience in producing major projects requiring photo and text research and verification including but not limited to stamps, textbooks, documentary films and other commercial products and through an extensive database of consultants and experts in a variety of fields.
2)	Issues and Options:

The USPS may require a transition management plan to be detailed so that the USPS feels comfortable moving from the incumbent supplier to a new supplier, if applicable, without losing support during an important period of the project timeline. 
3)	Required Criteria and Other Information:

The USPS intends to pre-qualify respondents capable of providing visual and textual research in the development of stamp subject research.  The USPS reserves the right to terminate this process if it is deemed that the availability or maturity of the commercial solutions do not fit the current need or vision of the USPS.  Responding to this notice does not guarantee pre-qualification or participation in future USPS activities.

The USPS reserves the right to reverse auction the pricing for this effort.  Complete description and coaching of this process will be provided to each supplier if the USPS elects this option.
4)	Selection Process:

The USPS decision to pre-qualify respondents is a business decision of the USPS Purchasing team.  Prequalification does not constitute an award.  Pre-qualification will be based on a composite of all responses, not any single item, that demonstrate a respondent?s capability to provide an innovative photography and stamp research services.  All qualified respondents may not be placed in the pre-qualified group if the purchase team determines that a smaller group may provide adequate competition or that some respondents are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding opportunities for others less qualified.  Respondents whose responses to this notice indicate that their solution is beyond the current or immediate experience level or resources of their firm, or deemed unrealistically incompatible with the USPS environment and vision, will not be considered for pre-qualification.
5)	Notification to Respondents:

The contracting officer will notify all respondents of their pre-qualification status.  The list of pre-qualified candidates will be publicized.
6)	Request for Information Instructions:

1.	The entire document should be saved and emailed to Nicholas.faiola@usps.gov by no later than 12:00 P.M. EST on November 20, 2007.  Please include ?Response to USPS Stamp Subject Research RFI? in the subject line.

U.S. Postal Service
PP&CS CMC
Attn:  Nicholas Faiola

3.	No faxed copies will be accepted.
4.	The limit is 15 pages and shall be concise and focused on the solicited questions.  The 15 page limit does not include support information such as sample research project plans, sample project schedules, etc.
5.	Do NOT submit cost or price information with responses.
6.	Sales brochures, videos and other marketing information materials are not solicited and will not be reviewed.
7.	The Contracting Officer for the USPS may accept responses after the due date.  Acceptance will be at the sole discretion of the Contracting Office, and in the best interest of the USPS.
7)	Minimum Requirements

The following is a current non-exclusive set of constraints (minimum requirements) that should be met for any responder seeking pre-qualification:

1.	The contractor will be required to support the visual research needs of art directors under contract with Stamp Development.
2.	The contractor will be required to manage stamp subject and design information.  This information includes but is not limited to:

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:

Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

JUSTIFICATION

1. Agency and Contracting Activity (FAR 6.303-2(a)(1)). 
USDA, AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE, National Animal Disease Center
2. Nature/Description of Action(s) (FAR 6.303-2(a)(2)).
       a. This contracting action is to obtain a service agreement.
3. Description of Supplies/Services (FAR 6.303-2(a)(3)).
       Service agreement for Waters QTOF Ultima Mass Spectrometer and upgrades for software.
4. Identification of Statutory Authority (FAR 6.303-2(a)(4)).
       10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1. The services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy the agency requirements. 
5. Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications (FAR 6.303-2(a)(5)).
           a. Only one responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2))     
       (1) FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) states, 
       "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for." 
       (2) The named vendor is the producer of proprietary equipment and upgrades which are not available through other vendors.     The proposed acquisition is for continuation of work currently being performed using equipment from the vendor. This effort requires the vendors to provide for continued maintenance of their proprietary equipment.
6. Federal Business Opportunities - FedBizOpps.gov (FBO) Announcement/Potential Sources (FAR 6.303-2(a)(6).
a. A Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) synopsis is published in an attempt to identify other possible vendors of the required maintenance/software. 
b. USDA/ARS does not anticipate other qualified sources; however, should any responses be received, they will be evaluated to determine if they can meet future needs of the Government.
7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost (FAR 6.303-2(a)(7).
       The mass spectrometer is a very sensitive instrument and each manufacturer?s instruments differ in parts, software and technical expertise.  It is therefore critical to maintain our service through Waters Corporation.
8. Description of Market Research (FAR6.303-2 (a)(8).
       USDA/ARS is constantly surveying the market and from this corporate experience knows that the maintenance/software is proprietary and only available from the vendor identified. 
9. Any Other Supporting Facts (FAR 6.303-2(a)(9))
       Due to the proprietary maintenance/software needed to perform the research, at this time there is only one source available. 
10. Listing of Interested Sources (FAR 6.303-2(a)(10).
       No other sources are available at this time.
11. Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition (FAR 6.303(a)(11)).
       Vendor for existing equipment have proprietary rights that effectively preclude competing upgrades and maintenance for the equipment. 
12. Technical Requirements and Certifications FAR 6.303-1(b) and FAR 6.303-2(b)
I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification are complete and accurate.

CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION: (FAR 6.303-1(a) 6.303-2(a)(12))
I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>The Department of Education is soliciting research proposals from small business firms who qualify for participation in the Small Business Innovative Research Program (SBIR).  SBIR is a  competitive program that encourages small businesses to explore their technological potential, as well as, providing incentive to profit from its commercialization.  The Small Business Act and the Small Business Innovation Research Program Reauthorization Act requires that Federal agencies with R&D appropriations in excess of $100,000,000 participate annually in the SBIR program.  By including qualified small businesses in the nation's R&D arena, high-tech innovation is stimulated and the United States gains entrepreneurial spirit as it meets its specific research and development needs.  SBIR funds help small businesses develop new products and services that relate to the mission of the agency.  Work under this program will be monitored by the Department of Education Institute of Education Sciences (IES)/NCES Contracting Office Representatives and the CAM Contract Specialists. SBIR awards are divided into three phases: Phase I awards are funded up to six months and $100,000.  Phase II awards are funded up to two years and $750,000.  Phase III awardees do not receive SBIR funding.  However, Federal agencies may award non-SBIR follow-on funding for products/processes developed in Phases I and II that prove to be commercially viable. The funding available for this solicitation is for Phase I of the SBIR program. Phase I determines, as far as possible, the scientific or technical merit of ideas submitted under the SBIR program.  The proposal should concentrate on R/R&D that will significantly contribute to proving the feasibility of the technological approach, a prerequisite for further ED support in Phase II. Period of Performance: Department of Education IES awards are for periods up to 6-months in amounts up to $100,000.  The Issue Date is 11/23/2007.  The Due Date for Proposals is January 22, 2008, 12:00 PM, Eastern Standard Time. The Estimated Awards Date for Phase I is March 27, 2008.  Additional information on how to submit a proposal for this requirement is located at: Solicitation at http://www.fedbizopps.gov., Solicitation Number: ED-08-R-0007.  Each organization submitting a proposal must qualify as a small business concern as defined by the SBA at the time of the award.  All responsible sources who qualify for participation in the Small Business Innovative Research Program may submit a proposal that, if timely received, shall be considered by the agency.

Response Date: January 22, 2008, 12:00 PM, Eastern Standard Time.

<DESC>A Fast-Track proposal is a single proposal that contains both Phase I and Phase II activities. Through the Fast-Track (Phase I & II) option, the Department of Education Institute of Education Sciences (IES) intends to fund meritorious proposals that have high potential for the commercialization of technologically innovative products that contribute to improved student learning and academic achievement in the field of education. By providing the opportunity to concurrently submit and review a proposal that contains both Phase I and Phase II activities, the Fast-Track option has the potential to minimize any funding gap between the Phase I and Phase II periods.   In order to apply for Fast-Track funding, offerors must submit both 1) a full Phase I proposal and 2) a Fast-Track proposal. Fast-Track proposals that are submitted without a Phase I proposal will not be evaluated.  In the Phase I portion of the Fast-Track proposal, the offeror must (1) describe the significance of the project; (2) specify clear, measurable goals (milestones) that detail the development of a functioning prototype of an education technology product; and (3) specify a research plan to test the feasibility of the prototype for implementation in a school or formal education delivery setting. This work must be achieved prior to initiating Phase II, as it will be used to judge the success of the Phase I effort.  In the Phase II portion of the Fast-Track proposal, the offeror must (1) specify clear, measurable goals (milestones) that detail the R/R&D process through which the prototype will become, or will be on a trajectory to become, a commercially viable education technology product, (2) provide an evaluation plan to test the efficacy of the product for achieving the intended outcomes in schools or formal education delivery settings, and (3) detail a commercialization plan for the sale and distribution of the product should all the technical objectives be achieved.  All Phase I proposals will be evaluated by a Phase I Technical Evaluation Review Panel. The Phase I Technical Evaluation Review Panel will not have access to the Fast-Track proposal that was submitted in the same package.  If an offeror's Phase I proposal is under consideration for a Phase I award, the Fast-Track proposal will then be evaluated. In cases where an offeror's Phase I proposal is not under consideration for a Phase I award, the Fast-Track proposal will not be evaluated.  All eligible Fast-Track proposals will be evaluated by a Fast-Track Technical Evaluation Review Panel. The Fast-Track proposal will receive a single rating for the proposed Phase I and Phase II project.  The government reserves the right to award a contract solely for Phase I to offerors who have also submitted a Fast-Track proposal. Offerors who submit a Fast-Track proposal that are unwilling to accept a Phase I-only award, should not submit a proposal.

<DESC>HYDRAULIC HARDLINE

The solicitation number is FA8601-08-T-0011.  The proposed contract is for the purchase of a Hydraulic Hard-line for the FIRST, Mechanical & Thermal Experimental Laboratory which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1.  The proposed source is MTS SYSTEMS CORPORATION.  
The supplies and services being purchased are as follows: 
?	Hydraulic Distribution Hoses for 13 Stations and 1 capped tee.
?	Two sets of hoses for connection of the Hydraulic Service Manifold to the hardline station and from the Hydraulic Service Manifold to the Test Equipment.
?	A ''Pre-engineering Site Inspection'' visit by an MTS (Mpls) Senior Hydraulics Engineer and Applications Engineer
?	Accumulator Manifold Assembly for Enhanced Systems Performance
?	Drainline Sump System 
?	Replace all HSM filters 
?	Drainline Sump System 
?	Hydraulic Distribution Hoses for 13 Stations		
?	Field Service Labor for the Hardline Distribution System Installation	
?	Freight Charges		
The government anticipates a sole source award to MTS SYSTEMS CORPORATION for the following reason:  MTS SYSTEMS CORPORATION is currently the only source that specializes in the understanding of the functionality and installation of the equipment. To deviate from original equipment manufacturer (MTS) would result in unacceptable delays due their unfamiliarity of the test equipment, as well as furnishing a system with potential performance limitations due the lack of knowledge of the flow requirements further brought about by a lack of understanding of test machine operations.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within fifteen (15) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<SUBJECT>14 -- Request for Information (RFI) from Industry for a Launcher Test Stand
<SOLNBR>N00030-08-I-0201
<RESPDATE>123107
<ARCHDATE>01152008
<CONTACT>Virginia Hennings, Contracting Officer, Phone 703-601-9447, Fax 703-601-9473, Email Virginia.Hennings@ssp.navy.mil
<DESC>1. DESCRIPTION

1.1 PURPOSE

SSP is assessing the feasibility of developing a launcher test stand to support missile integration and underwater launch (test shapes potentially leading to actual submerged launch of missiles and other payloads).  SSP requires input from industry resources to refine their understanding of the technical feasibility, risk and cost implications associated with this effort.  Specifically, this RFI documents a Government request from industry for the plan/approach and rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost information associated with launcher test stand development and production in the three phase approach discussed below. 

 
1.2 BACKGROUND

The test facilities used by SSP are no longer available.  SSP has been developing underwater launch systems for over 50 years to support submarine launched missiles.  SSP needs to conduct risk identification/reduction and integration testing of new payloads prior to onboard testing and final integration on a submarine.  An adequate test stand will replicate the missile tube interface and submarine support system interfaces in order to conduct demonstration and integration testing.  Although near term demonstrations will be based on the 87 inch diameter missile tube, smaller missiles than the D5 missile are likely to be demonstrated.  Additionally, concepts for future submarines may have missile tubes larger than 87 inches in diameter.  Therefore, in order to determine potential ?knees in the curve? from a cost and capability standpoint, missile tube diameters between 87 inches and 120 inches, and 87 inches and 32 inches are considered separately.  These ranges are only provided for the purpose of identifying the determining factors associated with these two ranges and to bound configurations to be considered.  To ensure that the test stand will be usable for all scenarios into the foreseeable future, the test stand should be flexible enough to accommodate a minimum missile tube diameter of 32 inches and maximum of 120 inches.

2. DISCUSSION

2.1 CAPABILITIES

SSP is seeking information for a launcher test capability for development testing of underwater missile launch systems.  This capability consists of three separate phases.  The first phase will support land based testing of missile launch systems.  The second phase capability will support submerged static launch of missiles and other payloads within the twelve mile contiguous zone of U.S. territorial waters.  The third phase capability will support submerged launch of missiles and other payloads in a relevant operational submarine environment within the twelve mile contiguous zone of U.S. territorial waters.  This relevant operational submarine environment will consist of varying launch depths and dynamic water flow conditions during missile launch induced by submarine forward way and sea state (i.e. crossflow).  The first phase capability shall:

1. Support land-based testing of launcher concepts as part of missile testing.
2. Replicate SSGN Missile Tube (nominal) internal interfaces (SSGN missile tube is right-cylindrical tube approximately 87 inches in diameter and 44 feet long)

a. Be reconfigurable to support larger diameter missile tubes up to 120 inches in diameter, ?-1 inch thick and approximately 44 feet long.
b. Be reconfigurable to support smaller diameter missile tubes as small as 32 inches in diameter, ??- 1 inch thick and approximately 44 feet long)
c. Contain and replicate functions/shape of missile tube muzzle hatch.
d. Replicate the space envelope in the missile tube.

3. Be transportable while remaining non-mobile to operate in different test locations. 
4. Comply with Government environmental and safety standards.
5. Accommodate ejection of missile and other payload weights up to 200,000 pounds.

The second phase shall add the capability to:

6. Support static, submerged test launches of missiles and other payloads within the twelve mile contiguous zone of U.S. territorial waters.
The third phase shall add the capability to:
7. Support submerged launch of missiles and other payloads in a relevant operational submarine environment within the twelve mile contiguous zone of U.S. territorial waters.

2.2 INTERFACE DEFINITION

Below is a listing of interface and performance considerations.  The following information is provided to support this concept development.  Government Furnished Information (GFI) will be provided by SSP as requested. 

1. Mechanical Interfaces (e.g. Physical interfaces, Pressurization & Venting system, Hydraulic system, Heating & Cooling system, Dehumidification & Drying system)
2. Electrical Interfaces (e.g. Umbilical for Data/Power)
3. Data Recording & Interface Data Connectivity
4. Environmental (test/handling shock, payload release shock (recoil), vibration, sea water immersion, sea water pressure, launch debris)
5. Wharfside operations & Initial Missile Onload (e.g. Cranes, Maintenance Platforms, Hoists)
6. Dry Stowage (e.g. mothballed)
7. Missile Launch (e.g. Eject velocity, Missile loads, Cavitation loads)
8. Wet Stowage
9. Missile off-load

2.3 INFORMATION REQUESTED

Provide conceptual technical information, comments and ROM cost assessments (where applicable) for the following items:

1. Test Stand Concept - Provide a Level 1(Overall System) physical architecture, approach and cost ROM for a test stand that meets the aforementioned capabilities (section 2.1-1 thru 5) and subsequent modifications to meet phase II capabilities (6) and phase III additional capabilities (7). Also provide architecture and ROM cost to allow the replacement of the nominal 87 inch diameter missile tube with up to 120 inch diameter missile tube or down to 32 inch diameter missile tube.  Discuss any issues related to providing this flexibility.
2. Design Impacts-

a. Comment on design considerations to modify the concept(s) from phases I and II to provide the desired phase III capability?
b. Comment on how the incorporation of the desired phase III capability would impact the phase I and phase II design concept(s).
3. Concept of Operations (CONOPS) ? Provide a CONOPS which clearly defines the associated test and tactical demonstration scenarios to be employed for each phase.  Include the anticipated test stand motion induced from payload release. Also, comment on how launch preparation, maintenance and downtime will be minimized, and how the design will minimize acquisition and operating costs. 
4. Test Facility Integration - Identify and describe any facility support/foundation requirements and or equipment for each phase.  Comment on any desired sea bed modifications (i.e. surface hardness) to support the test platform.
5. Multiple Locations - The test stand may be redeployed to other locations to meet test requirements.  These test locations could be land based CONUS, such as Crane, Indiana or Aberdeen, MD, at one of the National Test Sites such as PMRF, Hawaii, or in the ocean near one of these sites.  Comment on how the non-mobile launcher test stand will be broken down, transported, and stored at different test locations.  Provide any known physical or environmental limitations/constraints that will prohibit the use of the test stand at multiple locations.
6. Maintainability - In the past, the submerged launcher capability slowly eroded due to the high cost of maintaining the facility or set of facilities.  Provide comments on how this platform will accommodate both periods of testing and periods of storage, and will still be usable within a short time frame.    
7. Crossflow ? Describe methods to reach desired dynamic water flow conditions induced by submarine forward way and sea state conditions (i.e. crossflow up to 10 knots) at the muzzle face of the test platform.  The intent is to adequately replicate operational launch conditions.  Describe ROM costs and design considerations for different methods. 
8. Future modifications - Provide recommended future modifications (if any) that would make the test stand more robust for integration testing.
9. Risk - Discuss the risks associated with executing the proposed development plan to deliver the desired hardware to the government.  Also, identify any risks of using the test stand as proposed.
10. Cost - Discuss cost drivers associated with executing the design, fabrication and use of the test platform when going from phase I to phase II and phase II to phase III.
11. Schedule - Discuss project schedule to accomplish each phase.  Discuss constraints that would adversely impact fast tracking the project (i.e. initial operational capability within 18 months of contract go-ahead for phase I & II).

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334519   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and under the authority of FAR 13.1, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued under Request for Quote RFQ-DC-08-00026 and includes incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-20. The  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 334519 with a Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of 500 employees.  OBJECTIVES:   The required sources are intended to be used for the calibration and calibration checking of instruments used to  measure samples for radioactivity in two separate fixed laboratories at different geographic locations somewhere within the United States or its territories.  Each laboratory will receive thirteen sources consisting of alpha, beta, and gamma emitters in various geometries as identified in the  specifications, as each lab will receive: Item 1 - 7 Item 2 - 1 Item 3 - 1 Item 4 - 1 Item 5 - 1 Item 6 - 1 Item 7 - 1 Separate quotations are requested for each Item 1 through 7, or for combinations of these Items.  Separate contracts may be awarded for each Item, if it is determined that this  will provide the greatest value to the government. The specific locations where the equipment is to be shipped and installed have not yet been determined.  EPA will therefore perform receipt inspection at the vendor's facilities when manufacture is complete.  The inspection may be performed either  in conjunction with, or after, factory testing by the vendor, at the vendor's discretion.  This inspection by EPA will include verifying the functionality and interoperability of all components being provided by the vendor, and therefore must be performed with the equipment fully assembled and  prior to packaging.  The vendor will be responsible for packaging the equipment for temporary storage and/or shipment after the equipment is accepted by EPA. If EPA has not yet determined the final locations for the equipment at the time of receipt inspection, the vendor will be required to  provide temporary storage of the equipment for up to 6 months for Items 1 through 7.  The vendor's monthly demurrage fee for providing temporary storage, if any, should be quoted separately as Items 8 through 14. For Items 1 through 7, separate fixed price quotations are requested for shipment to  a destination within the 48 contiguous states, identified as Items 15 through 21.  In the event that EPA chooses one or more locations that are not within the 48 contiguous states, a separate contract or a contract modification will be negotiated for the additional shipping costs. The  specifications below are believed by EPA to be necessary to meet the functional requirements for the intended application, but alternatives will be considered provided that bidders can demonstrate how a proposed alternative will meet the functional requirements.   General Requirement applicable to  Items 1 through 7  1.	Documentation provided with equipment shall include certificates of assay showing NIST-traceability, or other comparable international standard, of the source.

<DESC>The US Navy intends to procure a Power PC (PPC) upgrade for the AN/ALE-47 Programmer, CD-45(V)1/ALE-47, Part Number 179730-0006.  The AN/ALE-47 Programmer contains a MIL-STD-1750A Central Processing Unit (CPU), Part Number 5962-89519.  Due to the age of the architecture, the 1750A does not provide required processing throughput to meet the U S Navy's immediate needs.   Mission vulnerabilities created by the continued use of the 1750A processor must be immediately reduced.  In order to eliminate these mission vulnerabilities the US Navy is planning to replace the 1750A CPU with BAE Systems' existing ALE-47 PPC CPU Input/Output (I/O) Circuit Card Assembly (CCA).   The selection of this CPU I/O CCA will eliminate the need for the current CD-45(V)1/ALE-47 Discrete I/O CCA P/N 174255-0006 which currently contains an obsolete part, P/N QL12X16B-0PF100C.  A hardware and commercial OFP demonstration is required 30 days after contract award. Military qualified, production hardware along with an Operational Flight Program (OFP) is required within 120 days of contract award to begin US Navy assault aircraft integration.  The BAE PPC commercial OFP which removes the 1750A processor limitations will support initial integration testing.  The commercial OFP will be modified in parallel with initial integration to incorporate the necessary US Navy assault aircraft functionality.  The US Navy plans to procure 800 production units following successful hardware and software integration as well as a complete technical data package.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to extend the term of Contract No. TIRNO-02-C-00022 and TIRNO-02-C-00024 for Electronic Payment (E-Pay) Services with Official Payments Corporation and Link2Gov Corporation, respectively, for three additional option periods pending the competitive award of Request For Proposals No. TIRNO-07-R-00004.  The three additional option periods consist of two twelve month options and one month period.  After exercising FAR 52.217-8, the E-Pay contracts will expire November 30, 2007.  The IRS does not anticipate an award of TIRNO-07-R-00004 before the E-Pay contracts expire.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The IRS has a continuing need to have an Electronic Credit Card Payment Program that allows taxpayers to make electronic federal tax payments by means of Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and Internet application.  The extension of the E-Pay contracts allows for the IRS to continue receiving electronic tax revenue during the period that the competitive re-compete has been awarded.  This is an extension of a previously competed contract.  Discontinuation of services will have an adverse impact on actual receipts and the Service's goal to increase the volume of payments received electronically.  The extension enables the IRS to mitigate risks to the nation?s financial infrastructure and allows for successful transition to new contract.  This is not a solicitation for proposals or an invitation for bids.  The Government does not anticipate receiving responses to this notice of a non-competitive action.  If parties choose to respond, any cost associated with the preparation and submission of data or any other costs incurred in response to this announcement are the sole responsibility of the respondent and will not be reimbursed by the Government.  The current contracts consist of an electronic payment system, which allows taxpayers to make federal tax payments through convenient, safe, and secure means, which reduces governmental costs and improve cash flow to the federal government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The purpose of this synopsis modification is (1) to change the answer to Question 17 regarding the radar detection capability as published in synopsis modification 06, and (2) to amend the solicitation to include contractor financing in the form of progress payments to successful small businesses, only.

Question 17.     Solicitation Paragraph D.2.4.3 -- 8.2 and 8.3 Radar Performance Requirements.     Detection of a 0.5m^2 target at 10km suggests detecting a 1m^2 target at range that is approximately 15% greater or 11.5 km.     Is the requirement for maximum detection range of the 1m^2 vehicle correct as stated or should the requirement read 11.5km?

Answer 17 (REVISED).     Solicitation Paragraph D.2.4.3 -- 8.3 is changed to read ---95% detection (Pd) of (surface) vehicles between 250 meters (820 feet) and 12 km (7.456 miles) required, 18 km (11.1847 miles) desired, with conditions as defined below ---  

2.	The following notices are added to Solicitation Section E, Part 2.

E.2.7	Notice of Progress Payments.

Even though the clause is included in the contract, the clause shall be inoperative during any time the contractor?s accounting system and controls are determined by the Government to be inadequate for segregation and accumulation of contract costs. 
(End of provision) 


Notice of Availability of Progress Payments Exclusively for Small Business Concerns (Apr 1984) (FAR 52.232-14)  

The Progress Payments clause will be available only to small business concerns. Any bid conditioned upon inclusion of a progress payment clause in the resulting contract will be rejected as nonresponsive if the bidder is not a small business concern. 
(End of provision) 


3.	The following provision and clause is added to Solicitation Section C, Part 2.

The FAA intends to add the following Mentor Protg Program Clauses to Sections I and M of the SIR in a subsequent amendment.  It should be noted that the Mentor Protg Program is not mandatory.

Participation or non-participation in the program will not impact evaluations.

<DESC>AMENDED:  THIS SOLICITATION HAS BEEN CANCELLED.  T

he National Institutes of Health (NIH), John E. Fogarty International Center (FIC), intends to procure the services of Origem Consultoria Ceintifica, Rua Nagib Izar 314, 03337-070 Sao Paulo (SP) Brazil to elucidate patterns of influenza and diarrhea from tropical regions of the world and implement user-friendly interfaces to inform end users about the causality of diarrhea disease. The Institute intends to purchase this service by other than full and open competition under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302. These services are set within the framework of an on-going Multinational Influenza Seasonality of Mortality Study (MISMS) study conducted by a team of epidemiologist from the FIC and National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The contractor has been involved in the study of spatio-temporal patterns of influenza and diarrhea with the FIC during the last year, resulting in the publication and submission of peer-reviewed articles and conferences abstract.  The contractor has been developing analytical tools for the Matlab platform that proved to be useful in several of the studies currently taking place and in fact to analyze data brought from different countries of the MISMS meetings

The contractor will analyze the datasets obtained now at Americas MISMS meeting, in addition to those that will be obtained at the Asia MISMS meeting.  These analyses will be based upon mortality data, virus surveillance date and vaccination coverage data as it relates to MISMS.  The description of such patterns will be performed in the highest possible resolution allowed by the datasets, both spatially and temporally.  The particularities of the influenza seasonal patterns in each geographic region will be described ? both in their stationary parameters (as captured by spectral estimation, which is mathematically related to Fourier decomposition analysis, whereby the variability of the time-series is described as a distribution of uncorrelated components of cycles) and in their non-stationary aspects ? as captured through the use of Wavelet analysis. The contractor will also investigate potential correlations between seasonal climate variations and mortality records based upon weekly Pneumonia and Influenza mortality reports.  Such investigations will be conducted by clustering the similar eco-climatic regions of each country and then exploring the climatic conditions that better explain both temporally and in amplitude their epidemiological patterns.  Monthly climatologies for the whole period and for each region will be obtained from the database originated by the interpolation of data from meteorological stations.
 
Interested vendors may identify in writing their interest with a capability statement to the Contracting Office prior to the closing date (16 November 2007) of this notice.

<DESC>The DHS Office of Infrastructure Protection (OIP) Protective Security Coordination Division  is seeking interested sources capable of completing the requirements that were initially performed on National Capital Region Rail Pilot Project (NCRRPP) (formerly known as DC Rail Security Corridor), and the AMTRAK Security Pilot Project (ASPP).  All further references to "DHS" herein mean DHS/OIP/PSCD.

This Sources Sought announcement is issued to assist the agency in market research by determining industry interest and capability under GSA MOBIS Schedule 874, SIN 874-7.  

This is not a request for proposal.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  Reimbursement will not be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.

The scope of this effort is to complete services for the NCRRPP and ASPP.  The Contractor shall engineer, procure, fabricate, install, and functionally test lights, cameras, Radio Frequency Identification, infra-red lighting, and applicable hardware and software devices to meet the requirements of this SOW.  These technologies shall include intelligent video surveillance of the rail lines through the most critical areas of the National Capital Region (NCR) as designated by DHS.  Surveillance shall include detection of unwanted intruders and the identification and distinction between unauthorized and authorized personnel.  This specialized system shall be installed in the entire DC Rail corridor that includes the critical areas at the L?Enfant Plaza, the Virginia Avenue Tunnel, the Long Bridge, the DC side of the Anacostia Bridge, Union Station, and the First Avenue Tunnel providing a secure perimeter using intelligent video surveillance.  This system shall also provide automatic annunciation of alarm events, two-way public communications to the tunnel portals, temperature sensors within the tunnels, monitor train movement through the tunnels, and provide a digital log of all tunnel activity and alarm events.  The portal area under Union Station, where unauthorized personnel on the passenger platforms can get access to the First Street Tunnel, shall also be secured with the intelligent video system.  The Contractor shall complete installation and functionally testing of the state of the art, COTS equipment that will create a specific virtual boundary (fence) within the exposed stretch of rail line within the NCRRPP.  For the ASPP, the Contractor shall engineer, install, and functionally test state of the art, COTS equipment that will create a specific virtual boundary (fence) within the exposed stretch of rail line within the ASPP.  The equipment has been purchased for the ASPP but not installed.  The virtual fence boundaries shall include the rail tracks and sufficient lateral distance from the tracks to provide adequate areas of video monitoring (BZ).The virtual boundary (fence) shall consist of video camera technology integrated with intelligent vision interpretation software that will enable the system to detect moving objects, detect intruders crossing virtual boundaries, identify personnel loitering in the area, and identify unauthorized suspicious objects left behind or objects removed along the rail line. The system shall be able to distinguish between authorized and unauthorized personnel. Any detection noted above shall automatically trigger visual and audible alarms at designated monitoring stations.  Security personnel at the monitoring stations shall be able to see live streaming video and perform further remote investigation utilizing PTZ cameras. Fixed and PTZ Cameras shall be placed to provide complete coverage of the BZ.  The system shall be designed to allow around the clock monitoring of real-time streaming video, data and alarm information to the Police Communication Centers (PCC) for CSX and Amtrak in Jacksonville, FL for CSX and either New York or Philadelphia for Amtrak.  The system shall be fully encrypted and web based.  Other users, as defined by DHS, shall receive web access.  They shall include, but not be limited to the following:  Washington Metropolitan Police, US Capital Police, National Park Service Police, and other emergency response agencies.  The contractor must have experience in intelligent video security systems, infrared lighting, utilizing camera systems to detect friend or foe, objects left, and objects removed.  The contractor also must have experience, training, and certifications for working on the Amtrak and CSX owned rail lines and experience working with Rail Security requirements and safety personnel (flagman, etc.). Special consideration should be given to the possibility of frequent interruption due to active rail traffic and the requirement that high voltage electrical plates will be required to be scheduled and shut down individually for all work on the north side of Union Station, from Union Station to the New York Avenue overpass.  The Contractor shall be responsible to familiarize themselves with all requirements to work at or near rail tracks of a class-one railroad.  The Contractor shall be responsible to obtain any and all required certifications, insurance, and permissions to work on Amtrak and CSX rail property and shall strictly adhere to all Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations and specific Amtrak/CSX requirements.

The CSX Head End Structure has been built and all equipment is installed in this Head End.  An intrusion detection system capable of distinguishing authorized from unauthorized personnel is integrated in the overall system and programmed to trigger an alarm as soon as any unauthorized person approaches the structure. The Amtrak Head End Structure has not yet been built.  All Amtrak Head End Equipment shall be housed in an existing, secure Amtrak room with the same design intent as the CSX criteria above. Lighting, climate control, access controls and adequate square footage shall not be the responsibility of the Contractor. A separate fence is not required to be installed around the Amtrak-secured building, however, dedicated security cameras, motion sensors and an intrusion detection system capable of distinguishing authorized from unauthorized personnel shall be integrated into the overall system and programmed to trigger an alarm as soon as any unauthorized person approaches the structure.

The Contractor shall design, procure, fabricate, install and functionally test two virtual gates which will host the Train Entry Alert Security System (TEASS) in a location outside the virtual fence and as approved by DHS for the NCRRPP, two virtual gates in total.  The virtual gates shall be located, one each, at the south side of the Long Bridge and the north side of the Anacostia Bridge.  The Contractor shall provide either a covered structure or use an existing structure on the existing rail line and a TEASS (at each virtual gate) as approved by DHS.  The TEASS shall include all necessary sensors, equipment and software to (i) provide advance alerts of trains approaching the DC Rail Corridor including live streaming video of such approaching traffic, with complete 270 degree viewing of the train as it enters and passes through the gate (two sides and top) (ii) detect leaking HM/TIH material, (iii) test the feasibility of detecting radioactive materials on a passing train, and (iv) detect unauthorized personnel tampering with the system.  The structure shall be equipped with an air collection system connected to the Chemical Detection System (CDS) and a Radiation Detection System (RDS).  The Contractor shall provide a combination of fixed and PTZ cameras and adequate lighting so as to allow security personnel to remotely inspect the approaching traffic and if necessary request a speed reduction or even the stoppage of a particular train.  The virtual gate shall be secured utilizing a combination of video camera technology and motion sensors to detect intruders.  The Contractor shall provide an access control system capable of distinguishing between authorized and unauthorized personnel. Any detection noted above shall trigger visual and audible alarms at all monitoring stations.  Security personnel at the monitoring stations shall be able to see live streaming video and perform further remote investigation utilizing PTZ cameras. The Contractor shall provide a full T1 circuit to the internet at each gate to connect the virtual gate to the overall system.  

All cameras, sensors, detectors and radio frequency equipment shall be connected via wire, fiber or wireless (or a combination thereof as deemed most effective by the Contractor) to the head end.  Head end equipment shall include all video servers, intelligent video processors, centralized controls, programmable logic controllers, and firewall equipment for the encryption of video and data from the system.

The Contractor shall develop an Explosive Detection System pilot designed to detect explosives in high traffic areas such as are found in Union Station.  The objective of the pilot system will be to determine and test the feasibility of detecting explosives utilizing existing technology on large groups of people in high traffic areas of critical facilities as determined by DHS. The system shall be designed for a traffic flow minimum of three thousand people per hour.

For NCRRPP, The Contractor shall provide four chemical detection sensors to enhance the chemical detection capability provided at each of the virtual gates.  The four chemical sensors will be spaced along the approximate 5 miles of NCRRPP track.  In order to facilitate CDS integration and connectivity, the additional sensors will be identical to the chemical sensors approved for use in the Virtual Gates.  The sensors will be hard wired to processors in the Head End.  All equipment and specifications for the 4 additional sensors will be the same as those used for the virtual gate chemical sensors and other security technologies used in this contract. The chemical detection systems shall be designed to detect the same array of TIH, CWA and other Hazardous Materials as the virtual gates, and at levels well below threshold limits.

The Contractor must have the ability (training, certifications, insurance, personnel, subcontractors, etc.) to mobilize to the site within 30 days after contract award.

Criteria 1 through 3 are of equal importance and Criteria 1 through 3 are more important than Criteria 4.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

<DESC>The sources sought is modified to have response by November 13, 2007 at 3:00 P.M (CST).  All other terms and conditions remain the same.  Send all responses to Kristy Daugherty, 507 Symington Dr. Rm W202, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, or by facsimile to 618-256-3091, or e-mail to kristy.daugherty@scott.af.mil. HQ Scott AFB/A7KQC is in the process of determining acquisition strategy for a follow-on contract for the sustainment of 42 Civil Reserve Air Fleet Aeromedical Evacuation Shipsets (CRAF AESS).  The team is soliciting responses from interested sources to determine capabilities to perform the follow-on contract.  We would appreciate any feedback industry has to offer.  This announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposal.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

The CRAF is a group of B-767 aircraft owned and operated as commercial aircraft by large air carriers such as TWA, Delta, and USAir.  These aircraft form an integral and extremely important element in the aeromedical evacuation plans during a national emergency or conflict.  These aircraft can be activated by the Secretary of Defense any time it is deemed to be in the national interest.  When activated the aircraft are given a short period of time to be configured and delivered, and be at the full disposal of the Air Force.  While the aircraft are still owned and operated by the air carriers and crews, they are assigned to perform military missions.  The aircraft are operated under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rules and regulations and the aircraft captain has the authority to determine whether or not the aircraft meets the FAA specifications at any time.  Since the aircraft will always be operated according to FAA rules and regulations, all equipment and procedures used aboard the aircraft must also be in compliance with FAA rules and regulations.  

The AESS was designed for use on the B-767 aircraft as a conversion kit which allows the aircraft to be used as an aeromedical evacuation platform during times of conflict or peacetime disasters.  The CRAF AESS consists of three major subsystems: 

     a.  The patient transport subsystem ? freestanding litter stanchions that accommodate 3 patients per stanchion (87 patients total) which are independently attached to existing aircraft seat tracks.  NOTE:  The baseline configuration for the aircraft includes accommodations for 10 medical personnel, 6 flight attendants, and up to 40 ambulatory patients (in seats).
     b.  The medical oxygen subsystem ? consists of six 75-liter oxygen dewars (450 liters total) and a heat exchanger installed on a single pallet in the forward cargo bay using existing cargo fittings for tie-down.  This subsystem provides therapeutic oxygen to support a 12-hour mission with 60% of the patients using oxygen.  The converted oxygen is routed to a management panel in the main cabin via oxygen hoses routed through existing vent openings on the left side of the aircraft.  The oxygen is then routed along the aircraft main deck at 300psi via oxygen hoses attached to the litter stanchions.  Oxygen manifolds attached to the litter stanchions reduce the pressure to 50psi for use by the patients.  Emergency oxygen will be provided by standard dixie cup masks that are on oxygen lines extended to reach the lower litter tier.
     c.  The aeromedical operations subsystem ? consists of 2 nurse workstations, a regulated 60Hz electrical power supply, and storage facilities.  Electrical power from the 400Hz aircraft power bus is converted through six 5kW 400-to-60Hz converters and routed through the right side of the aircraft.

Each shipset weighs approximately 20,000 lbs. and is stored in 21 large, individual crates in an environmentally controlled government warehouse currently located in Ft. Worth Texas.  Each shipset has a 20? W X 16? L X 16? H footprint and contains components that require periodic inspection and preventive maintenance to assure that operational readiness is maintained.  

The CRAF AESS is a FAA approved modification to a commercial aircraft; therefore, it is under Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) control, currently maintained under STC number SA5039SW-D.  

The shipsets have been designated war readiness material and are critical in nature.

Contract Requirements: 

1.  The successful contractor shall be responsible for maintaining the CRAF AESS in a constant state of operational readiness and will provide technical and logistical assistance in support of shipset deployments.  As FAA certified equipment, the CRAF AESS must be under the control of an entity known as a Designated Alteration Station (DAS).

2.  The successful contractor shall provide all direct material in support of storage, inventory, inspection, preventive maintenance, repairs, STC maintenance, hardware modifications, shipment, installation/de-installation, refurbishment, unpacking/repackaging of shipsets, and other tasks necessary for sustainment of the system.  All materials shall conform to FAA approved data including any inspection and certificates applicable to the materials furnished by the contractor.

3. The successful contractor shall maintain configuration control of the CRAF AESS Installation/Instruction Manual to keep it current.

4.  Activation of the shipsets is possible at any time.  The successful contractor?s installation team will be required to install shipsets into B-767 aircraft, given an arrival rate of two aircraft per 24-hour period.  A range of 1 to 40 shipsets could be activated, depending on Government need and the urgency of the situation.  Upon activation, the contractor will be responsible for transporting shipsets from the storage location (currently in Fort Worth, Texas) to the contractor's installation facility.  Contractor supplied field maintenance will be required based on Government need.
 
5.  It is anticipated that a training exercise of the CRAF AESS will be conducted once every 2-3 years.  In addition to transporting and installing a shipset from the storage location to the contractor?s installation facility, the contractor will be required to transport a Government-owned patient loading system to support the exercise.  Contractor supplied field maintenance will be required based on Government need.

6.  The successful contractor shall maintain configuration control of the STC sealed drawing package.  The CRAF AESS is a FAA approved modification to a commercial aircraft; therefore, it is under STC control, currently maintained under STC number SA5039SW-D.  The successful contractor shall also update or supplement the STC documentation as necessary and ensure the STC is not compromised through changes to the CRAF AESS or to the assigned B-767 aircraft.  The successful contractor shall follow the Systems Engineering guidance as found in ASC/EN Systems Engineering Guide, 5 April 1996 and FAA Advisory Circular AC 21-40, May 6, 1998.  

7.  The CRAF AESS is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved system because the oxygen used for the patients on board the aircraft must be medically safe to use.  Therefore contractors must follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) as required by section 520(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act).  The GMP regulation covers the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for the design, manufacture, packaging, storage, and installation of all devices.  The GMP regulation is codified in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 820 contains general quality assurance (QA) or quality system requirements in areas of concern to all manufactured devices.   

8.  Preventive Maintenance Inspections (PMI) will occur under a varying schedule depending on the asset and FAA rules.  For planning purposes, the PMI schedule ranges from every 6 months to once every 5 years.


CONTRACTOR CAPABILITIES NECESSARY TO PERFORM CRAF AESS SUSTAINMENT:

1.  Be licensed by the FAA as a DAS and be licensed to perform work on B-767 aircraft.  As FAA certified equipment the CRAF AESS must be under the control of a DAS.  DAS designation and FAA licensing are a major requirement of the successful contractor.  Please discuss whether or not your company is DAS qualified or if your company has the potential to become DAS qualified in order to perform AESS maintenance.  If FAA licensing will have to be acquired, how long do you anticipate the licensing process to take?  What are the anticipated costs, if any, to the Government for obtaining the required licensing?

2.  Ability to obtain a station license modification, which adds CRAF AESS sustainment and installation/de-installation.  Obtaining a station license modification may require the successful contractor to provide a B-767 for an installation demonstration for the FAA.  Discuss your capability in meeting this requirement.  

3.  STC maintenance.  See contract requirement above for maintaining the STC configuration.  Discuss the feasibility of obtaining the STC and the timeframe/cost associated with initiating this process in order to perform as the successful contractor for the follow-on CRAF contract.  

4.  Expertise in handling/operating/servicing large liquid oxygen systems.  The Liquid Oxygen Storage Subsystem (LOSS) is a major component of the CRAF AESS system and requires specific expertise to ensure it is maintained in accordance with contract requirements.  Please discuss whether or not your company has expertise in handling large LOSS systems.  Discuss your experience in adhering to GMP as required by section 520(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act).  See contract requirement listed above.    

5.  Facilities.  The successful contractor must be able to provide a hangar and a runway capable of accepting B-767 aircraft at any time as well as sufficient space to park up to three B-767 aircraft while two aircraft are undergoing modification.  Please discuss whether or not your company has sufficient facilities and/or capabilities for accommodating the required numbers of B-767 aircraft in order to perform CRAF maintenance/modification.  If you do not currently possess the facilities, how will you obtain facilities in order to meet contract requirements?

6.  AESS activation.  The successful contractor must have the capability (during a national emergency) to provide the facilities, equipment and personnel to transport and install shipsets at the rate of 2 aircraft every 24 hours beginning not later than 48 hours after activation notice.  If these facilities differ from those described above, provide a description of your facilities but also explain how you will accomplish this task with the proposed facilities.  Since the AESS is currently stored in a government warehouse in Ft Worth Texas it is preferable that the contractor?s facilities be within the contiguous United States.  However, the government is interested in entertaining other ideas with respect to AESS storage, location of contractor?s facilities, while still meeting all contract requirements. 

7. Parts Manufacturing Authority (PMA).  Describe your ability to obtain parts manufacturer approval for the CRAF AESS components.

OTHER:

1.  The rough order of magnitude for CRAF AESS sustainment (contractor logistics support) follow-on contract is estimated to be between $7 - $9 million, assuming no aircraft are activated.  Activation and exercises are to be pre-priced, preferably at a firm-fixed price, subject to Government need and availability of funds.  The follow-on contract would either be a basic year plus four 1-year options or a multi-year contract for 5 years.  

2.  L3 Communications Integrated Systems (formerly Raytheon E-Systems) is the developer, manufacturer, and current maintainer of the CRAF AESS. 

3.  It is requested that interested/potential sources respond to the capabilities outlined above in sufficient detail within 20 days from the date this notice is published in Fed Biz Ops.  Please submit your responses to Ms.  Kristy Daugherty, kristy.daugherty@scott.af.mil , Contract Specialist, HQ AMC/A7KQC, 507 Symington Dr., Rm. W202, Scott AFB, IL   62225-5022.

Arcuri, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-4777, email: Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil.  
The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division in collaboration with U.S. Joint Forces Command and Electronic Systems Center are soliciting proposals for innovative approaches in support of the Multi-sensor Aerospace-ground Joint ISR Interoperability Coalition (MAJIIC) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD).  The objective of MAJIIC is to demonstrate network-centric "Post Before Process" ISR capabilities that will enable warfighters and C2ISR systems on IP based operational C2I networks to access and utilize near real time ISR data. ISR data of interest includes mission and sensor data from U.S. Joint Service and Multi-national coalition manned and unmanned air platforms with an initial focus on video, EO, IR, SAR, GMTI, and ELINT sensors. MAJIIC capabilities will be open, scalable, secure, and non-intrusive to current operational ISR architectures; support common and emerging DoD/NATO/Commercial data formats; provide data pedigree and quality tagging; provide a range of data access methods including XML-based Web services and APIs; work in bandwidth challenged environments on DoD operational networks; and provide a flexible architecture that will support both distributed and traditional client-server deployments.  The ultimate goal of MAJIIC is to improve ISR data accessibility and utility in support of time sensitive missions, battlefield situational awareness, decision making, and C2I analysis.  The MAJIIC PRDA will focus on the following technology areas: database optimization techniques; XML-based web services; automated video, imagery and streaming data optimum dissemination techniques; and common geo-registration. In the area of database optimization, technologies are sought to find the optimal techniques in the storage, cataloging, retrieval, and searching of video, EO, IR, SAR, GMTI, and ELINT sensor data, and mission situational awareness information, that will enhance the ability to share data across Service, Joint, and Coalition networks. This will include data parsing, conversion, compression, cataloging, and tagging. In the area of XML web-based services, technologies are sought that will allow for "disadvantaged" users (bandwidth challenged and/or lacking an application that supports raw ISR data formats) to access and display ISR data over the operational network in a legacy and/or commercial formats.  Advanced XML-based web services are also sought to support distributed machine-to-machine interactions, as well as concepts for managing information services across theater networks (e.g., service interface standards, service registries, ontology, access control).  Automated video, imagery, and streaming data dissemination techniques are required to allow for the optimal distribution of real-time and archived video, GMTI, EO, IR, SAR, ELINT, mission, and steaming data across networks that may have limited bandwidth constraints. Common geo-registration is needed to accurately determine target location by reducing detection errors from multiple sensors; MAJIIC is specifically concerned with registering GMTI detections, SAR, ELINT, EO, IR, and video data.  These technologies will be used and validated in military exercises, currently scheduled annually, two (2) per year.  The expectation is that one of these exercises will be in the U.S. and the other exercise will be in the Europe.  Exercise participation will include integration and checkout prior to the exercise, military operator training, technical support during the exercise, performance and discrepancy data collection, and post-exercise analysis.  Additionally, there will be approximately four (4) working group meetings per year, two (2) of which will be in the U.S. and two (2) in Europe, with each meeting lasting approximately one week.  An unclassified briefing for all interested firms will be held on 1 October 2003, at the Beeches Hotel and Conference Center, 7900 Turin Rd (Rt. 26), Rome, NY 13440 at 0900 hours.  A hard-copy briefing package will be made available to all attendees.  Please contact John Vergis at (315) 330-1771 (e-mail John.Vergis@rl.af.mil) or Lt. Tony Rendon (315) 330-2548 (e-mail: Antonio.Rendon@rl.af.mil) no later than 29 September 2003 if you plan to attend.  Firms who do not attend the briefing, but desire to have a copy of the additional material can access this information from the FedBizOps special notice available at  http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/prda/prda-main.html, under the 03-16 PRDA link.  This material will be posted no later than 3 October 2003.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a white paper, not exceeding ten (10) pages, summarizing their proposed approach/solution. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Offerors' white papers may address all or a selected technology area(s) within the scope.  White papers that focus on selected technology areas should include a description of how the concept will integrate with the other technology areas.  The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission. All white papers MUST be submitted to ATTN: John Vergis, AFRL/IFEA, 32 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4114, and reference PRDA-03-16-IFKA.  This PRDA is accepting white papers until 1 Oct 2009, but white papers must be submitted by no later than 10 Oct 03 for consideration of the initial FY 04 award. White papers submitted after this date are less likely to be funded in FY04.  Beyond FY 04, it is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:  FY 05 should be submitted by 1 May 04; FY 06 by 1 May 05; FY 07 by 1 May 06; and, FY 08 by 1 May 07. White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  All responsible organizations may submit a white paper which shall be considered.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: (1) Soundness of Approach; (2) Relevance to the Mission; (3) Uniqueness of the Approach, and (4) Cost Realism and Reasonableness. Note: Criteria 1 through 3 are of equal importance and Criteria 1 through 3 are more important than Criteria 4. Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this PRDA.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this PRDA.  Awards of efforts as a result of this PRDA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions. Individual awards will not normally exceed 48 months with dollar amounts ranging between $200,000 to $800,000 per fiscal year. Total funding for this PRDA is anticipated to be $24.5M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this PRDA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 04 - $1.000M; FY 05 - $5.565M; FY 06 - $6.195M; FY 07 - $6.565M and FY 08 - $5.175.  Selected offerors may be required to review classified material up to the US SECRET and NATO SECRET level; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to the proposed effort must be cleared for, or eligible for, access to US SECRET and NATO SECRET information. In addition, the offeror must have or have access to a certified and Government-approved facility available to support work under this PRDA.

The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the contracting officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY; THIS IS IS NOT A RFP/RFA.

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources that are capable of supporting the Department of Transportation?s Garrett A. Morgan Technology and Transportation Education Program (GAMTTEP). The purpose of this program is to improve the preparation of students, particularly women and minorities, in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) through curriculum development and other activities related to transportation. 

Parties interested in this effort must be capable of conducting programs to improve students? STEM skills at the elementary and secondary school levels (kindergarten through 12th grades (K-12)). Each program should be capable of enhancing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics at the elementary and secondary school level through such means as: 

(A) Internships that offer students experience in the transportation field; 
(B) Programs that allow students to spend time observing scientists and engineers in the transportation field; and 
(C) Developing relevant curriculum that uses examples and problems related to transportation. 

These programs will also assist in building the capacity of educational agencies to plan, implement, sustain, and evaluate transportation education activities in order to facilitate interest in the field of transportation and ultimately supply skilled employees needed for the future transportation workforce. Eligibility to participate in this program is limited to Local educational agencies (LEAs) and State educational agencies (SEAs). A LEA shall be defined as a public board of education or other public authority legally constituted within a State for either administrative control or direction of, or to perform a service function for, public elementary schools or secondary schools in a city, county, township, school district, or other political subdivision of a State, or of  or for a combination of school districts or counties that is recognized in a State as an administrative agency for its public elementary schools or secondary schools. (Section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801). A SEA shall be defined as an agency that has the primarily responsible for the State supervision of public elementary schools and secondary schools. (Section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801). Also the term ?institution of higher education? has the meaning given the term in section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001).

FHWA encourages other interested parties, e.g., universities, businesses, associations, etc., to enter into partnership agreement with a LEA or SEA to assist with program activities. Also please note a priority will be given to vendors that encourage the participation of women and minorities. 
       
The FHWA anticipates posting a Request for Application (RFA) for this requirement on or about December 03, 2007  on both FedBizOps and Grants.gov. All interested applicants should closely monitor both FedBizOps and Grants.gov. for this requirement.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact -Robert Robinson, Contracting Officer, 617-494-3433
<DESC>Between 1923 and the early 1990s, a mine near Libby, Montana, produced millions of tons of vermiculite ore.  This vermiculite has been found to be contaminated with Libby amphibole asbestos (LA), a known human health risk.  In vitro and in vivo toxicological studies are being planned to assess the toxicity of LA as well as other mineral fibers.  These studies will involve exposure of cells and/or tissues in culture, as well as laboratory animals, to LA and other mineral fibers.  The studies are described in detail in the paper titled, Dosimetric and Toxicologic Assessment of Amphibole Fiber-Containing Material from Libby, Montana (U.S. EPA-ORD-NHEERL in consultation with U.S. EPA Region 8, U.S. EPA NCEA, and U.S. EPA OSWER, August 14, 2007).  A copy of this peer-reviewed paper, hereafter referred to as EPA 2007, may be obtained at the following website:  http://www.epa.gov/region8/superfund/libby/Revised_NHEERL_LA_StudiesFinal.pdf.  As a result of these studies, various types of biological specimens will be generated which require careful evaluation of fiber concentration.   The Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) seeks sources that would be able to provide support to assist in method-development studies and tissue analysis, both of which are critical to support the in vitro and in vivo toxicological studies described in EPA 2007.  Specifically, the support required is to provide expert processing of biological samples (e.g., cells, tissues, organs), generated from toxicological investigations of LA and other fibrous minerals, for determination of fiber content by electron microscopic (EM) analysis.  Additionally, support related to study design will also be required.  The actual live animal testing will be performed by EPA or a separate contractor - no animal testing will be conducted under this proposed contract.    Support efforts will include, but are not necessarily limited to, the development, review, and/or implementation of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) related to the processing of biological specimens from toxicological studies of LA or other mineral fibers, for initial EM analysis and eventual detailed EM analysis.  Additional required support may include in vivo study design consultation and the development, review, and/or implementation of SOPs for the collection and preparation of the respirable fraction of LA and other mineral fibers for the toxicological investigations.   The Volpe Center is seeking offerors with expertise (i.e., history of research experience and publication in peer-reviewed scientific literature) in the following areas: (1) implementation of animal toxicity studies of fibrous material; (2) preparation and analysis of dosing material for animal toxicity studies of fibrous material (generation and characterization of fiber aerosols); (3) preparation of biological/tissue samples from animal toxicity studies of fibrous material for EM analysis (this involves low temperature ashing, bleach digestions, EM grid preparation and stabilization); (4) characterization of fiber burdens in various tissues, including but not limited to lung, trachea, and pleura (this characterization includes EM analysis and evaluation of bivariate distribution of fibers from biological samples (scanning EM and transmission EM analytical experience required)); (5) evaluation of mucociliary clearance velocities; (6) interspecies dose calculations for fibers; and (7) modeling particle and fiber deposition and clearance in rat lung and correlation of theoretical results of fiber retention with experimental data of fiber concentration in biological samples.  Additionally, offerors must have the ability to safely determine fiber content of biological samples (e.g., cells, tissue, organs) by EM analysis.  Equipment for and expertise with low temperature ashing of biological samples and transfer/preparation of grid for EM analysis is required.  Analytical expertise in EM is also necessary, as well as a history of complying with applicable health and safety precautions associated with handling asbestos samples.   All capability information shall include: Contract number; Customer (Government agency, private industry); Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) name, telephone and fax numbers; contract value and type of contract; period of performance; and description of product/services. Information provided should be detailed in the area(s) above so the Government can assess the ability of the company to provide the described services. All of the information sought should be conveyed in no more than eight pages. Page size is set at 8 X 11 and text should be doubled spaced. Each response must reference the Sources Sought title. Interested parties must respond to this announcement in writing within 15 days of publication. Telephonic requests will not be honored.

Since the modular furniture is and will be dispersed over various locations within U.S. Senate buildings, the SAA requires modules which are configurable to accommodate the unique needs or idiosyncrasies of the users of the modules.  There are approximately 460 workstation modules.  The SAA will contract directly with furniture manufacturers located in or servicing the local Washington DC commuting area in order to have a local contact for on-site furniture issues that may arise during delivery, installation, and maintenance.

After receipt and review of the responses to this SSN, the SAA intends to issue a solicitation. The information contained in this notice will be the only information provided by the Senate during the Sources Sought process.  Manufacturers should respond to this Market Survey - Sources Sought by submitting an information package in accordance with the instructions provided below.  The SAA has already prequalified seven manufactures of modular furniture systems.  AllSteel, Haworth, Herman Miller, Kimball Office, Knoll, Steelcase, and Teknion.  Additional manufacturers responding to this notice and deemed qualified by the SAA may be requested to submit a proposal in response to a solicitation.

<DESC>Type: Sources Sought Announcement.

Posted: 06 November 2007.
Due: 14 November 2007.

Place of Performance: Washington, DC area.

The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) is posting this sources sought notice on behalf of the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA).


National Minority Enterprise Development (MED) Week is an annual event sponsored by MBDA in collaboration with the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA).  The annual national observance of MED Week is conducted through a conference at which successful minority businesses, advocates, and corporations are recognized for their outstanding contributions and support of minority business enterprises.  The conference also serves as a forum for information exchange through plenary sessions and seminars, and resource identification through opportunity fairs and other networking forums.  


Although one hotel facility has been identified, the objective of this sources sought notice is to identify other companies capable of hosting MED Week in accordance with the mandatory requirements described below. This market research is being conducted through FedBizOpps to reach the widest possible audience and to determine the availability and potential capability of hotels to provide these facilities and services.


MBDA's needs for this event revolve around the following priorities:  date, capacity and location.  The date is an important factor because the President designates a week in September or October as the week for the observance of national minority enterprise development.  The date cannot conflict with any major holidays or events (i.e. Hispanic and Black Congressional Caucus events).  Based on these requirements, MBDA has determined that the 2008 MED Week Conference should be held during the week of September 1, 2008.  Specifically, the conference would be held on September 3-5, 2008, with hotel contract requirements beginning on September 2, 2008.


The conference capacity is the second order of priority.  The capacity is a critical factor because experience has proven the event to be well attended.  The functional space for exhibitors, conference meeting space, and hotel room capacity are also deemed critical to a successful event.  


The location is the third order of priority.  Historically, MED Week is held in the Nation's Capital, Washington, DC and provides for the most effective national spotlight on the efforts of the Federal government as it relates to minority business development. The facility needs to be located within the general Washington, DC area, not more than 10 miles from the Department of Commerce Herbert C. Hoover Building at 1401 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC and in close proximity of Washington Reagan International Airport.  Finally, the site shall be within a 1/4 mile of a Metro subway station. 


The contractor shall provide the necessary services and facilities (space, lodging, food, staffing, and basic equipment) for the conduct of the Annual National Conference in observance of Minority Enterprise Development Week (MED Week). Facilities for the Annual National MED Week Conference must accommodate the more than 1,000 persons participating in the planned events. 


A fixed price, single award is anticipated, with an estimated performance period beginning as early as January 1, 2008 through October 30, 2008. 


If your organization has the capacity to perform these services, please provide the following information: 1) Organization name, address, email address, web site address and telephone; and 2) Tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort and any pertinent supporting documentation that clearly demonstrates the company's ability to deliver these supplies and services according to the requirements described above.  Organizations responding to this market survey should keep in mind that only focused and pertinent information is requested.  


The Government will evaluate the capability information using the following criteria: 1) Contractor is able to meet date requirements; 2) Contractor is able to meet capacity requirements; 3) Contractor is located in Washington, DC; and 4) Contractor is able to provide lodging at the published government rate.  To be considered an affirmative response, the response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements. Interest parties must address each of the mandatory data requirements listed in the Justification in sufficient detail to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement.     


THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND ONE IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.  This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals and submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.  Again, this is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Any information received in response to this notice will be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.


Responding firms should provide one (1) electronic copy of a tailored capability statement by 4:00pm (EST), Wednesday, November 14, 2007 via email to Matthew.Courtad@noaa.gov. Reference: "MBDA MED Week Services and Facilities - Sources Sought" in the subject line.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Synopsis constitutes a Request for Information to assist the Air Force conduct Market Research of Industry to identify potential sources that may meet Air Force requirements for the development of a Joint Threat Emitter double-digit surface-to-air missile threat simulator capability.  The Government?s preferred solution is the development of a threat kit capability that includes applicable threat(s), antenna and other associated equipment or components that can be integrated onto an existing Joint Threat Emitter system or other core threat simulator that?s already fielded on an Air Force or Navy range and can use existing power sources and Command and Control Units to reduce development costs, however, other solutions will be considered.  The Hill AFB, Utah Range Threat System Program Office (RTSPO) intends to generate a purchase request leading to contract award for the development, integration, validation, test and support for one simulator.  The development phase will be approximately 24-36 months.  All pricing arrangements are being considered.  A responding company must provide rationale if any Cost-Plus type pricing arrangements is not appropriate for their solution and provide rationale if a Fixed type pricing arrangement is recommended.  Based on the simulator?s successful development, the RTSPO may generate a purchase request ultimately leading to a production contract award for an undetermined number of systems.  The contract award may be against a new contract, an existing delivery order contract, and/or an existing delivery order.

This Request for Information is for a high-fidelity system that will simulate some or all of the functions of the SA-10, SA-11, SA-15, SA-17 and/or the SA-20.  At a minimum, the threat capability will simulate signals for the SA-10.  The minimum signal to represent is the target tracking radar signal for each threat, with the detection and engagement radar signals being the next priority.   The RTSPO encourages the use of already existing technology and/or off-the-shelf components in an effort to reduce costs.

The simulator shall simulate the early warning, acquisition, tracking, and missile guidance radars at effective radiated power (ERP) to sufficiently replicate threat tactics.  Antenna pattern simulations shall also accurately replicate the target threat types.  

The threat simulator?s signals must be generated with sufficient fidelity to be recognized and processed by applicable onboard sensors to include Radar Warning Receivers (RWRs), EA systems, and High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) Targeting systems (HTS) associated with all blocks of existing aircraft.  

The threat simulator shall generate sufficient radiated power to produce appropriate threat indications on aircraft threat warning/sensing equipment at ranges that equate to Air Force Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-1 maximum tactical range values for a given threat detection, tracking, or engagement radar threat systems.  Or, for detection, tracking and engagement threat systems with ranges that exceed 60 nautical miles (NM) and 60 thousand feet AGL, the radiated power must produce the desired aircraft system response to 60 NM and 60 thousand feet AGL minimum and at no less than 75 percent Effective Radiated Power (ERP) as a minimum as defined by the EWIR database.  The EWIR database values for full ERP is desirable, but not required.  The simulator must be able to produce simulations of applicable threat radar antenna patterns representative of the actual threat to include antenna main beam and 1st order side lobes.  

The simulator shall be capable of automatic/manual tracking during day and night operations.  Emulation of air defense threats including simultaneous illumination and/or tracking of multiple aircraft is desired, but not required.  

The simulator shall include Electronic Attack (EA) data, including but not limited to, amplitude modulation (AM) (pulsed and noise), noise bandwidth and signal centering measurements (range gate pull-off [RGPO], velocity gate pull-Off [VGPO], jamming/signal [J/S]) and real-time EA mode identification to support reactive threat operations.  

The simulator shall possess reactivity capability for threat system engagement of target platforms with or without air combat instrumentation.  Reactions shall be manually, semi-automatically, or automatically implemented to simulate threat system operational tactics and reactions to EW employed in the environment. 

In addition, the simulator must meet all requirements listed in the Joint Threat Emitter Capabilities Production Document (CPD) dated 18 May 2006.  Interested sources can Contact Mr. Dean Huber at dean.huber@hill.af.mil for a copy of the CPD.  Specific items of CPD interest are listed below: 

- The simulator must operate in a ground mobile environment.  The simulator shall be capable of being deployed for training use in forward operating locations and deployed at improved (e.g. graded roads and concrete pads) and unimproved (e.g. no roads, no pad - literally anywhere on a range) sites.  The simulator shall be compatible with both a remote power unit that can be remotely powered on and off and commercial power.

- The simulator shall be capable of remote operation, in manual, semi-automatic and automatic modes of operation and able to interface with the Air Combat Training System (ACTS).  The simulator will have the capability to receive; display, measure and store designated jamming waveforms, and will provide recorded data for detailed post-mission jamming analysis

- The simulator shall be programmable to allow realistic IADS operation in autonomous, semi-autonomous, and manual modes.   

- The simulator shall utilize HLA/DIS architecture/protocols for its external communication requirements and TENA compatibility.  

- The simulator shall use a government determined 2-Level maintenance concept and be highly reliable and maintainable.  

- A video system (with zoom lens) with display and digital record capability is required to provide tracking and post-mission feedback for aircrew debriefing.  

A responding company must verify willingness to deliver the capability with drawings, data and software necessary for the maintenance and/or competitively contracted maintenance, and to have a complete competitive technical data re-procurement package.  The response must clearly identify limited/restricted rights on any software, hardware, drawings or data that would be included in the technical data package.  The response must identify, as a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM), what percentage of the total cost/price would be for furnishing all drawings, data and software in the manner identified above; this percentage must only include the portion of the drawing-data-software cost/price that is not part of the actual development effort (e.g. intrinsic value for extra rights on propriety drawings-data-software that the contractor already has).  The response must also identify as a ROM what percentage of the total cost/price would be for the development effort as a result of not having the necessary JTE technical data and software, while still meeting the CPD requirements identified in an above paragraph.   

Since the Government may not have a competitive bid package for the JTE Block 0, Kit 1 system, if a solution is proposed to use the core JTE (a threat kit integrated on the JTE), any interested parties must clearly identify with supporting rationale if they have the ability to meet the requirements without a competitive bid package from the Government.  At a minimum, following is the technical data and software necessary for compatibility with the JTE Block 0, Kit 1 that cannot be released due to limited and/or restricted rights include:

-	Threat Emitter Unit Signal Generator (CEESIM) software
-	Range Data Integration Processor components of the Command & Control subsystem software
-	Mission Situation Awareness Terminal components of the Command & Control subsystem software
-	Transmitter controller software

Each interested entity that has the capability to meet the requirements identified above hereby has the opportunity to provide supporting rationale that they can meet the identified requirements; each response must also include any other additional information that is requested within the Sources Sought Synopsis.  In case the Government develops a requirement that is consistent with the ?preferred solution? identified in the first paragraph of this sources sought synopsis, an interested entity may provide a response addressing the preferred solution and a separate response addressing another solution.  The Government also requests that each interested entity also provide a ROM of the estimated total cost/price of each solution that they provide a response on; even though delivery of this ROM is not required, please note that a delivered ROM will not be used to make an award decision, or to obligate the Government.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT Provide capability and source information for Architect-Engineering and Construction services for Upper Midwest Veterans Integrated Service Network, VISN 23, under Request for Information RFI VA-263-08-RI-0078. The Department of Veterans Affairs is seeking sources for the following:  The VISN 23 Contracting Office is seeking information for SITE PREPARATION design and construction services at each site.  We are seeking input regarding any or all of the following possibilities. 	Design-Build** - all three facilities combined (one team) 	Design-Build** - each facility independently (three teams, or an alternative combination) 	** may involve two phase selection procedures 	Design-Bid-Build ? - all three facilities combined (one A-E and one Construction Contractor) 	Design-Bid-Build ? - each facility independently (three A-Es or an alternative combination and three Construction Contractors or an alternative combination) 	? may involve the use of existing VISN 23 BOAs with A-E(s) "Design" means defining the construction requirement (including the functional relationships and technical systems to be used, such as architectural, environmental, structural, electrical, mechanical, and fire protection), producing the technical specifications and drawings, and preparing the construction cost estimate.  "Design-bid-build" means the traditional delivery method where design and construction are sequential and contracted for separately with two contracts and two contractors.  "Design-build" means combining design and construction in a single contract with one contractor.   "Plans and specifications" means drawings, specifications, and other data for and preliminary to the construction.   "Two-phase design-build selection procedures" is a selection method in which a limited number of offerors (normally five or fewer) is selected during Phase One to submit detailed proposals for Phase Two.  It is the Government's intent to identify contractors who have the capability to design and/or build at three VISN 23 facilities.  VISN 23 is acquiring three new Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines.  One each is to be installed at the VAMC Minneapolis, MN, the VAMC Sioux Falls, SD, and VAMC Des Moines, IA.  The MRI equipment at Minneapolis is intended to be placed in renovated space.  The MRI equipment at both Sioux Falls and Des Moines will be placed in new additions, with renovations to accommodate tie-in to the existing buildings.  The MRI units being purchased are manufactured by Phillips and it is the VA's intent to incorporate the patented Phillips "ambient experience".  The delivery date for the equipment is still pending.  The machines will be acquired by the VA National Acquisition Center (NAC), Hines, IL and the only relationship to this RFI will be the requirement to obtain the manufacture's specifications for proper site preparation.  The NAICS Code is 541310 and/or 236220.  All responsible and interested sources should notify the POC by letter, fax, or e-mail of their interest and capabilities.

<DESC>1)  The Office of the Joint Program Manager for Lightweight 155mm Howitzer (JPM-LW155) is seeking navigation and pointing device vendors willing to participate in a market survey and risk reduction test program for the 105mm  M119 towed howitzer. 2)  This Government is working to digitize the M119A2 howitzer.  The digitized howitzer will need to  be capable of determining cannon pointing orientation  (pitch and yaw) together with the cannon trunnion roll, and providing position information, both with and without GPS aiding.  One of the major technical risks in this program is the survival of the navigation and pointing device  during gun fire shock.  This effort looks to demonstrate there is available hardware capable of surviving this environment through testing under actual operating conditions at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona.  The objective of this effort is to determine whether existing devices can survive multiple M760 cartridge (heated to 145 deg F) gunfire shocks at low and high quadrant elevation.   Testing is expected to commence in January 2008.  Vendors who participate will witness and receive the test results of their device. 3)  It will be the responsibility of each interested vendor to install its device onto an M119A2 gun in accordance with an interface to be provided  It is also expected that vendor personnel will be on-site for the anticipated  one day setup, two days on a firing range and one day removal.  Each vendor will monitor its device through a user interface which needs to continuously  provide device status responses throughout the gun fire cycle.  If the offered device does not have embedded GPS receiver, then the vendor should bring a GPS receiver to interface with its device.  The Government will provide any classified fill data material for the GPS receiver.  4)  The testing program will consist of firing a maximum of 50 rounds, with  the exact firing parameters to be determined prior to the start of testing.   However, the majority of the rounds fired will be at worst case firing  conditions of M760 cartridge (zone 8) conditioned to 145 deg F and quadrant  elevations ranging to 1244mils. 5)  All devices provided by vendors will be with the understanding that the  Government is not responsible for any damage which may be incurred to the  equipment during this test.  All costs incurred by vendors willing to  participate in a market survey and risk reduction test program will remain  the vendors responsibility.  A vendors sole consideration for participation  in this test/market survey will be a copy of the test report for its device.  6)  Due to schedule, funding and range constraints, the Government may find it  necessary to limit the number of devices participating in the testing.  If  the same aiming and pointing device is offered by multiple vendors, the  government will only test the device once. 7)  Interested vendors should submit specifications (point accuracy, position  accuracy, and test results to date) and development/production status for any  proposed device by 30 November 2007.

STATEMENT OF WORK ? GENERAL:  Since its inception the Border Patrol has utilized horses in support of the mission to which it is assigned.  Certain minimum requirements have been established and the successful contractor/seller is expected to comply with the established parameters when supplying horses for service mounts. 

REQUIREMENTS: Breeds- Quarter Horses are the desired breed. Crossbreeds may be accepted on a case-by-case basis, as determined by the government. Age- the horse shall have a documented age between five (5) and ten (10) years of age. (Exceptions to purchasing an older horse will be made on a case-by-case basis.). Weight- the horse shall weigh no less than 900 pounds and no more than 1250 pounds. Size- the horse shall measure not less than 15 hands and not more than 16.5 hands in height. Sex- All service mounts will be altered male horses (Geldings). 

SELECTION CRITERIA: The following shall be considered in selecting a horse for service: Most riders have little or no experience. The horse must be capable of carrying 200-250 lbs. of weight for long periods of time (6-8 hours/Day). Horses will be subjected to high desert/low desert; mountainous terrain; loose rocks; thick brush; extremely hot temperatures in the summer and drastically cool winters. A certified Border Patrol Instructor and the Coordinator or a designee for the Tucson Sector will administer a series of tests to determine whether the horse has the capability of working in the Border Patrol environment. Each horse will be required to pass these tests for acceptance into the program. 

SELECTION EXERCISES/TESTS: A candidate horse must be sound and well proportioned in conformation. The horse shall be gentle and calm with a good disposition. Following are a series of tests that the agents will conduct to determine whether or not a horse will meet the minimum requirements for purchase. Approach- When approached, the horse should turn and face, standing quietly, especially in a confined area. Halter- The horse should be easily haltered without giving any indications of head-shyness or resistance to ?catching?. Leading- The candidate horse should exhibit good ground manners and should remain calm when being handled. Saddling- The candidate horse should stand still and calm while being saddled. He should show no signs of aggressiveness of being ?cinchy? during this process. Mounting- The candidate horse should stand still and calm during this evolution. Reining- The candidate horse should demonstrate a proper understanding of stopping, turning and backing with only a light to moderate touch of the reins. Excessive force should not be necessary during this process. Dismounting- The candidate horse should stand quietly while the rider dismounts. Loading/Unloading- The candidate horse should load and unload from a variety of trailers without difficulty. Balking will be a disqualifying factor when considering the purchase of a candidate horse. Shoeing- The candidate horse should stand quietly and calmly while being shod or having his feet worked on. 

TEMPERAMENT: All candidate horses should exhibit the ?proper temperament? during the entire selection process. The candidate horse should be calm when any number of people or equipment are moving or standing around him. He must display confidence in any number of environments, including areas of unsure footing, tight enclosed or narrow spaces, moving vehicles/equipment, loud noises and/or bangs and popping sounds. Although the flight or fight response is always prevalent, the candidate horse must remain calm or quickly recover and not run off with the rider when startled. The candidate horse must possess a gentle and calm demeanor during the hours of darkness and around large groups of people. 

DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED: Current vaccination/Quarantine records. Health certificate issued by a certified/licensed veterinarian. Registration certificates, breed surveys and other related paperwork, as applicable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: A certified veterinarian will perform a full physical examination of the candidate horse as a prerequisite to completing the selection process. 

MISCELLANEOUS: The Government retains the right to return a candidate horse to the contractor/seller, if after 45 days, the animal is deemed not suitable for service. This determination will be based on the selection criteria or the horse is discovered to have a pre-existing medical problem, chronic disease or a hereditary defect that could render the horse unsuitable for service. The vendor will replace the horse within thirty days of receipt of notice that any of the aforementioned conditions exist. This animal shall be replaced with a suitable horse that meets all the selection criteria. The Government retains the sole right to make any and all determinations as to the acceptability/unacceptability of the candidate. The contractor/seller shall not, in any case, hold the Government responsible for the disposition of a medically or physically defective horse.

LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION AS FOLLOWS:

LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION FOR SECURE COMPUTING SIDEWINDER G2 APPLIANCE FIREWALLS/WARRANTY/TECHNICAL SUPPORT/TRAINING AT NCTAMS LANT DETACHMENT DJIBOUTI


1.	IDENTIFICATION OF AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: This is a Limited Source Justification. The requiring activity is the Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station Atlantic (NCTAMS LANT) Detachment Djibouti; the contracting activity is NCTAMS LANT Norfolk, Virginia.

2.	  NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF CONTRACT ACTION: This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program 1949 (41 U.S.C. 252, et seq.). This is a limited source action to be awarded as a new Federal Supply Schedule Delivery order. 

3.  DESCRIPTION OF REQUIRED SUPPLIES/SERVICES: The proposed acquisition is to award a delivery order to replace existing Cyberguard appliance firewalls. It is intended to acquire (8) Secure Computing Sidewinder G2 Version 6.1 appliance firewalls, 36 month warranty/technical support contract, and off-site classroom training.  Existing- onsite contractors are expected to perform the replacement and configuration of the procured firewalls.  The delivery date will be not later than ninety days from the date of award. 

3.	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE AND/OR DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS: 

The proposed requirement is to acquire Secure Computing Sidewinder G2 Version 6.1 appliance firewalls, to include 36 month warranty/technical support and off-site classroom training. Due to Secure Computing Inc. recent acquisition of Cyberguard Inc., Cyberguard hardware will no longer be serviced or supported as of December 31 2007. This procurement will provide hardware, software, and training to effect reliable and secure network firewall protection and service for the unclassified and classified network enclaves at Camp Lemonier Djibouti. In order for firewall hardware replacement to occur, basic and advanced firewall administrative classroom training is necessary for onsite contractors and Navy personnel; training is also required for contractors to sustain the system and properly operate and maintain the network firewall appliances. 

5. DETERMINATION OF THE BEST VALUE: GSA has already determined the prices of the hardware, warranty/technical contract, and classroom training.  Therefore, ordering activities are not required to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing. NCTAMS LANT Contracting Officer will determine, using the procedures in FAR 8.405, that the order represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering competitive pricing, special features, administrative costs, etc) to meet the Government?s needs. The Contracting Officer may, also, seek additional discounts before placing the order.

6. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH:  The requiring activity has conducted market research among schedule holders and certifies that the requirement can be met by a commercial item. 

7.	ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS:  The procurement uses a GSA schedule and will restrict soliciting to only one manufacture Secure Computing Inc. and award in accordance with FAR Subpart 8.4. The procurement must be competed and awarded under an already existing class 70 GSA schedule. NCTAMS LANT holds only GSA Schedule Authority as delegated by the Fleet and Industrial Supply Center who is their Head of Contracting Agency. The contracting officer is warranted to place delivery orders up to the maximum order limitation of the GSA schedule. .

8.	ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO COMPETITION:  All future requirements will be handled on a case-by-case basis; however, all continuing requirements will be competed under the Class 70 Telecommunications GSA Schedule.

9.	 CONTRACTING POINT OF CONTACT:  The point of contact at NCTAMS LANT is Linda Mathews, Contracting Officer, 757-445-9704, DSN 565-9704 or by email at linda.mathews1@navy.mil. 

ALL PROPOSALS AND QUESTIONS ARE TO BE VIA EMAIL TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER: L. MATHEWS at linda.mathews1@navy.mil.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS, 
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1(a)(1) and 6.302-1(a)(2) and the Bureau of Prisons Acquisition Policy Subpart 6.304(b), the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has determined the use of other than full and open competitive procedures is justified for this procurement action.  The following is supporting documentation in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.303-2 (Content).  

1. Contracting Agency - United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Central Office, Administration Division, Acquisitions Branch, National Acquisitions Section.   

2. Description of Action - Information, Policy and Public Affairs Division, Office of Information Systems has a requirement for annual software maintenance services for Tetragon Limited Liability Corporation (LLC) Intercomm Teleprocessing Monitor software.  The Intercomm software directs and controls all transactions and terminal access to the BOP SENTRY System.  

3. Description of Supplies and Services Required to Meet the Agency?s Needs - Inclusive of the Estimated Value - The BOP requires the annual software maintenance services for the Intercomm Teleprocessing Monitor.  The software maintenance services includes: a. All new software releases; b. System updates; c. Program Temporary Fixes (PTFs); d. Twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week for system software assistance.  The estimated value of the annual software maintenance is $109,200.00.  

4. Statutory Authority Substantiating this Action - FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements - (1) Citations: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). 

5. Reason for Authority Cited - The BOP requires maintenance and support for the Intercomm Teleprocessing Monitoring which controls the functions and abilities of the SENTRY system.  Intercomm is a mainframe telecommunications transaction processing system, which directs and controls all transactions and terminal access to the BOP SENTRY system.  The SENTRY system is an ongoing, steady-state, legacy system with development and enhancements done by BOP staff.  SENTRY fully supports the BOP?s business operations, which include inmate population monitoring, sentence monitoring, designations, central inmate monitoring, administrative remedy system, inmate discipline, and financial responsibility.  Without the maintenance of the Intercomm Teleprocessing Monitor, online access to the SENTRY database will cease to exist.  The agency?s need for the services listed above can only be provided by one source.  Tetragon owns the propriety rights to this software.  The services required are not available from other sources.  

6. Efforts to Obtain Competition - A pre-solicition notice will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities website, www.fedbizopps.gov, which will offer notice of the BOP?s intent to award a contract on a sole source basis to Tetragon LLC and request quotations from interested parties.  

7. Contracting Officer?s Fair and Reasonable Cost  Determination - A review of Tetragon LLC?s proposed price was completed by the contracting officer.  Based on the submittal from Tetragon LLC and additional market research, it was determined that the quote was 53 percent below established market pricing and is acceptable to the Government.  In addition, historical data supports the fact that software maintenance fees are generally 15 percent - 
25 percent of the current manufacturer?s suggested retail price of the software.  In this instance, maintenance support services are lower than the standard percentage when compared to the market price of the software.  The prices offered by Tetragon LLC are considered fair and reasonable based on market research, historical data, and previously paid prices.  

8. Market Survey - A pre-solicitation notice will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities website, www.fedbizopps.gov, which will offer notice of the BOP?s intent to award a contract on a sole source basis to Tetragon LLC and requested quotations from interested parties.  

9. Other Factors - The maintenance and services and support is required to maintain the Intercomm Teleprocessing Monitor which incorporates the SENTRY system.  Lack of maintenance for this system would be detrimental to the BOP, as the SENTRY system controls and directs many phases of transactions and interactions within the BOP concerning inmates.  

10. List of Sources - Tetragon LLC owns the proprietary rights to the Intercomm Teleprocessing Monitor software.  

11. Action to be Taken to Promote Future Competition - Not Applicable.  

12. Contracting Officer?s Certification -  I hereby certify that this request for Limited Source Justification is made in good faith, that the supporting data and information are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  
//s// Kristina M. Sullivan, Contract Specialist, National Acquisition Section

13. Technical Certification - I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in this Limited Source Justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  //s// Andrew Ellis, Chief, Network Management
Requirements Certification - I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in this Limited Source Justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  //s// Earl Franks, Chief, Information Technology, Planning and Administration

14.  Concurrence - I certify that the above justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  //s// Jan R. Johns, Chief, National Acquisitions Section, //s// Matthew D. Nace, Chief, Acquisitions Branch, //s// Bruce K. Sasser, Assistant Director For Administration

Approval - //s// Darlene Ely, Procurement Executive

STATEMENT OF WORK

INTERPRETING SERVICES FOR DEAF COUNTERFEIT SPECIALIST 

BACKGROUND

The U.S. Secret Service in Washington, D.C. has a deaf Counterfeit Specialist in need of a dedicated sign language interpreter to be on the premises on a full-time basis to meet the employee?s communication needs.

OBJECTIVE

To procure the services of a contractor for interpreting services, to enable the U.S. Secret Service to provide effective communication between the deaf Counterfeit Specialist and individuals within the Secret Service as well as individuals from external sources.

QUALIFICATIONS

Interpreters contracted to work for the U.S. Secret Service must be Qualified/Certified members in good standing with the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID). These individuals must demonstrate high competence in and knowledge of ASL and transliteration. The contractor shall be able to understand, translate, and interpret technical terminology, laws, regulations, concepts, principles, practices, and procedures applicable to the Secret Service. Interpreting in legal or classified environments is highly desirable. Interpreters must possess knowledge of the Deaf Community and Deaf Culture. In addition, they must have obtained an education pertaining to the interpreting profession, and have a minimum of three years experience. 

The primary interpreter, and anyone backfilling in their absence during courtroom assignments, must be able to understand and interpret/translate legal terminology, and be qualified to perform in a courtroom setting.

Contractors must submit their resumes and a copy of RID certification with their proposal. Failure to submit these items will deem the contractor non-responsive and have the proposal rejected.

CLEARANCE

The interpreters must have a Top Secret security clearance.

SCOPE OF WORK

The contractor will provide dedicated, on-call sign language interpreting services on Mondays through Fridays from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. for the deaf Counterfeit Specialist. The services provided will be professional in nature and will be in accordance with the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf Code of Conduct. Under no circumstances will the interpreter represent the U.S. Secret Service or act as an official spokesperson on behalf of the agency.
In the event that the primary contractor is unable to perform as scheduled, the contractor shall arrange (in advance if possible) for a replacement interpreter, meeting the minimum requirements of the contract and possessing any clearances required for the assignment. This will include sick and vacation days. In such situations, payment of the replacement interpreter will be the responsibility of the contractor. The substituting interpreter must be RID certified and qualified. The Secret Service will not pay the contractor for Federal holidays that fall within their regular scheduled days, for days the Government closes for inclement weather, or for days that the deaf Counterfeit Specialist is on leave and the contractor has been provided a 48-hour notice. Some training/functions may require additional interpreters; however, notice will be given when there is a need.
 
Intermittent interpreting services may also be required from the contractor. Intermittent services are defined as services required in addition to the dedicated on-call position. The contractor shall provide interpreters who have appropriate clearances and qualifications, on an as-needed basis to satisfy this requirement. Examples of intermittent services include:
?	Interpreting assignments that are expected to exceed the standard period that an interpreter works continuously without a team, and based upon professional discretion, the contractor shall consult with the Supervisory Counterfeit Specialist to determine if an additional interpreter is necessary.
?	Other situations that require additional contracted personnel are those assignments that are two days or longer in duration (i.e. certain travel, instruction, training, conferences, and courtroom testimony).

The U.S. Government Standards of Conduct also applies.

The U.S. Secret Service will provide the necessary equipment and supplies needed for performance of duties.

MAJOR DUTIES

?	Interpret effectively into English and ASL to facilitate effective communication between the deaf Counterfeit Specialist and other individuals.
?	Interpret in all settings where services are required. Possible settings may include training classes, presentations, courtrooms, one-on-one meetings with supervisors, managers and employees, staff meetings and interviews.
?	Provide consultation to managers/supervisors concerning the profession of sign language interpreting.
?	Maintain involvement in the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) and other professionally related organizations and/or training programs.
?	Work closely with the U.S. Secret Service Contracting Officer Technical Representative concerning scheduling and/or matters relating to the provisions for services at U.S. Secret Service.
?	Maintain professional conduct, dress, and manner.

REQUESTS AND CANCELLATIONS

When possible, the schedule for daily interpreting services as well as preparation materials will be provided to the contractor in advance of the activity. Cancellation for daily on-call services as well as intermittent services will be provided to the contractor a minimum of 48 business hours in advance of the scheduled assignment.

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

All documents (both hard and soft copy) that are produced during the duration of the contract by the contractor for the government shall be considered government property and shall be provided back to the government upon termination of the contract, or upon request.

GUIDELINES

Guidelines consist of the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) Code of Conduct, the operational policies of the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity, the regulations set forth in Sections 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended. The contractor shall keep all documentation and information pertaining to the services they provide within the laws covering the Privacy Act, and shall consider all activity to be confidential in nature when servicing the Agency or individuals. 

TRANSPORTATION REQUIREMENTS

The contractor will be required to provide interpreting services to the deaf Counterfeit Specialist located at U.S. Secret Service Headquarters in Washington, D.C. The contractor must be willing to travel to other sites within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area as needed to include southern Maryland. Local travel, within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area will be the responsibility of the contractor. 

The contractor shall be available for domestic and foreign travel with the deaf Counterfeit Specialist to provide interpreting services for meetings, presentations, training, conferences, and expert witness trial testimony. Travel will be arranged through invitational travel.

WORK ENVIRONMENT

Work is performed in an office setting, laboratory, meeting room, classroom, courtroom, and/or auditorium. The demands of the services may require the contractor to provide long hours of service to the deaf Counterfeit Specialist, sometime standing without a break.

<DESC>This amendment two provides further answers to questions:

1.	Does the PNC?s existing repository include palm print images?  No.   If so, (a) how many, and (b) should offers include a price for palm print record conversion?

2.	We have reviewed Amendment 1 but are still unclear about the assumptions to be used with regard to database size. The solicitation states that there will be 1 million tenprint and/or latent records, but the breakdown provided in Amendment 1 adds up to 800,000.  Please confirm that the numbers provided in Amendment 1 are correct. Also, please break down the Latent Records category as Palm Latents and Finger Latents.

El Salvador does not currently collect palm print data and has a limited latent database.  For purposes of database scaling, it is assumed that the total data storage capacity will accommodate the equivalent of one million ten print records.  Amendment 1 estimates a future database consisting of 600,000 ten print records, 100,000 palm records and 100,000 latent records.  Given the larger average file size of palm records compared to ten print records (3:1)  the total of 800,000 records as detailed is roughly equivalent to one million ten print records.  


3.	Please confirm that this is an accurate representatin of the daily workload requirement based on the information provided in the solicitation and in Amendment 1. If it is not, please clarify the workload requirements 

Transaction Type	Daily	Hourly (Average)*
Tenprint-to-Tenprint	5,000	208
Tenprint-to-Latent	5,000	208
Latent-to-Tenprint	50	2
Latent Finger to Latent Finger	50	2
Palm Latent to Palm Print	100	4
			Based on 24-hour day

	
	The figures listed in the above chart are accurate as listed. 

4.	The solicitation instructs offerors to provide minimum/maximum response times for all required transaction types. In order to provide this information, offerors would need to know the peak hourly workload for each required transaction type. Can you please provide this information or, alternatively, change the solicitation instructions to request only average response times. 

No peak hourly workload figures are available as this is a new application that will establish a national electronic fingerprint program.  Given the size of the data base and the relatively low number of anticipated daily transactions, contractor is advised to assume that the majority of the daily workload will occur during the normal (8am-5pm) business day and scale their proposal so as to meet the response time requirements given.

 
5.	For purposes of calculating response times, shall offerors assume a full search of the target database, without the use of demographic information or pattern classification?

Contractor is free to choose the best method to achieve the established response times, as long as the response time is met for all transaction scenarios.

 

6.	Data from benchmark tests performed by several major law enforcement agencies during the past three years suggests that it is now reasonable to expect an AFIS to achieve 99.9% accuracy. Given this, we suggest the government consider increasing the accuracy standard for tenprint-to-tenprint searches.

Contractor is welcome to exceed the accuracy requirement without prejudice.

7.	Please specify the accuracy requirement for latent palm and fingerprint searches.

Minimum accuracy requirement for all searches is 99%.  Higher accuracy percents are acceptable.

8.	FAR 52.212-1 (4) requires that offerors provide a technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements of the solicitation. Please specify the information vendors must provide to demonstrate that their systems meet the government?s accuracy requirements.

Offerors are free to provide whatever information/documentation they possess to demonstrate the accuracy of their proposed system -- independent testing, past performance, etc.

9.	Please state how many FBI-certified printers are required and where they will be installed.

One FBI certified printer is required and it is to be located with the AFIS at the PNC laboratory.

10.	Please clarify what operations will be performed using the remote data entry terminals. In addition to being used for record entry and to receive results, will these workstations be used for latent fingerprint/palm print analysis and for verifying search results? If not, please state whether offerors should include workstations for latent print analysis and verification in their offers and, if so, where. 

Work station(s) supporting the central AFIS should be capable of performing latent print analysis and verification tasks.  This work station should be co-located within the facility where the AFIS is installed.

11.	The RFP states that the evaluation factors will be rated as acceptable/unacceptable and that an unacceptable rating on any factor will be cause to remove the offeror from further consideration. For the purposes of determining whether an offeror is deemed technically acceptable for corporate experience, can we assume that the offeror must demonstrate that it has successfully installed and supported multiple systems of similar size and scope? 

Contractor should be able to demonstrate that is has successfully installed and supported a system or systems of similar or larger size and scope.

12.	FAR 52-212-1 (10) states that past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, is to include ?recent and relevant contract for the same or similar items?.   For purposes of determining if an offer is technically acceptable, what does the government consider ?recent?, and what does the government consider ?relevant??  Can we assume that a "relevant" system is a distributed system that stores 1 million or more records and processes thousands of transactions per day?

Contractor may submit past performance experience regardless of contract dates and system requirements.  Successfully completed contracts that more closely resemble the requirements and proposed solution for this contract will be considered more relevant.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions from prospective offerors.

Question 1:  Does the contractor have to create the work orders or just prepare the data so they can be developed by in-house staff? 

Answer: For normal deficiencies, they will be cropped onto work orders by in-house staff.  Like deficiencies and/or deficiencies using the same labor discipline may be combined on the same work order by the in-house staff.  There is a service call form that is used for deficiencies requiring fewer than 16 man-hours worth of labor to correct.

Question 2:  Please verify that there are no code compliance needs under this task order? 

Answer 2: Yes, a facility condition inspection, not a code compliance inspection.

<DESC>The object of the solicitation is to obtain off-site digitization services to scan official SDDC Fort Eustis, VA records.  The Government requires physical access within 24 hours  no faxing of documents because the Government might need entire box.  This must be accomplished at no cost to the Government.  Digitization services must be within 50 miles of Fort Eustis, VA.  The SDDC Operations Center at Fort Eustis has a requirement to complete scanning documents for G6(145 boxes) and G8(105 boxes).  Al l scanned documents must be compatible with and loaded into the command standard Hummingbird EDM System version 5.1.0.5. The contractor will be required to convert hard copy official records into electronic format at the contractors facility.  The digitiz ed documents are to be delivered on CD-ROM discs in a format yet to be determined (i.e., tif, pdf, etc.) for future retrieval of documents and indexed data from the Hummingbird system.  No DVDs, only CDs are available for usage on the servers. Scanning may  require electronic digital enhancement of scanned images to improve readability to include de-skewing, cropping, speckle-removal, and/or rotation.  The conversion project will include transportation of the boxed files, document preparation, scanning and i ndexing (up to 10 fields), reassembling boxed files and return to our facility.  The boxes are standard file boxes, not bankers boxes.  The boxes will be available in stages.  Not all the boxes are available at one time because some of the files are being  used daily and will have to be boxed when ready to be scanned and then be returned in a reasonable time.  Document preparation may involve removing staples and/or paperclips or other clips used to bind the documents.  Estimates are 12-15 pages per folder.   Documents to be converted are primarily 8 ? x 11, but may include sizes up to up to 11 x 17.  The 11 x 17 are estimated to be 15 percent.  Majority of documents are on standard office paper, but may include some onionskin or other carbon copies and compu ter generated reports on pin-fed paper.  Grayscale is acceptable.  Duplex documents are estimated at 5 percent.  There will be indexing for 1-9 indexed fields.  There will be a list of fields available to the awarded vendor.  Indexing is on every page.  Th e largest indexed field size could be up to 12 alpha-numeric characters. The indexing fields are usually located on the first page.  Contractor will make an on-site visit to coordinate with POC for schedule of work. No limit on number of onsite visits, mus t be coordinated with POC at SDDC.  Documents to be digitized will be unclassified and will be in appropriately labeled boxes.  The documents are indexed as determined by the designated POC and will be attached to every box.  After documents have been digi tized and recorded on CD-ROM, the CD-ROM and documents will be returned to SDDC Operations Center.  All documents are to be returned to the original folder, original box and delivered to SDDC Fort Eustis, 661 Sheppard Place, Fort Eustis, VA.  The base peri od of performance is 26 Nov 2007 until 28 Mar 2008.  The contractor will be required to provide periodic updates and onsite visits at contractors expense as required.  The proposal should include labor costs, administrative and overhead costs, BPA fees, t ransport fees etc.  Pricing should be per box.  Award will be on a low cost, technically acceptable basis.  Any questions must be submitted no later then 7 Nov 2007, 12:00PM email or via phone 757-878-8366.   Proposal shall include DUNs number, Cage code, business size and GSA number if applicable and a contact address and phone number.  Proposals should be three pages or less and be emailed to spencerm@sddc.army.mil no later then 13 Nov 2007, 12:00 pm
