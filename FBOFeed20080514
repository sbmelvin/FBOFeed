<DESC>Transformation Contracting Project<BR><BR> <BR>Synopsis <BR> <BR>Recently, the US and ROK governments agreed to transition wartime operational command and control (OPCON) of ROK forces to the ROK military in 2012.  This will result in the inactivation of the current U.S. led Combined Forces Command, and the establishment of a U.S. complementary supporting joint command in Korea.  This will be a challenging transition for both the U.S. and ROK from organizational structures and ways of doing business that have been practiced in Korea for decades.  This requires a qualified team with experience in joint transformational issues.  The goal of this effort is to support USFKs mission to transform from its current configuration and mission set to a separate, complementary joint warfighting command by designing operational logistics organizations, structures, and processes.  This initiative will assist the USFK J4 in designing, implementing, evaluating, analyzing, and directing US Joint staff transformation logistical services requirements.    <BR> <BR><BR>This transformation team shall be expected to provide USFK J4 with a full range of  support in developing our transformed US joint staffs logistical operations capabilities throughout South Korea.  Services must be extendable to cover activities such as developing, defining, acquiring, maintaining and evolving the vision and process enablers in advancing the logistics development processes; developing the metrics to measure transformation progress and value-added year round and during designated exercises; synchronizing and leveraging capabilities and activities of the joint logistics and organizational development community; developing and leading a associated year round transformation education program; imbedding with J4 and working with J staff as required to write and develop base documents such as Concepts of Operations (CONOPS),  Operational & Organization Concept (O&O), Standard Operations Procedures (SOP), and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs); and providing primary J Staff consultation.<BR><BR><BR>USFKs J4 requires contract support in designing, implementing, evaluating, and analyzing the logistical program / plan. This team will use USFKs Organizational and Operational Concept Plan; Transformation Master Plan; and our Training and Exercise Objectives, Tasks, and Milestones to support USFKs incremental transformation between FY 2008 and FY 2012.  Accordingly, this team shall be required to thoroughly understand these documents and their impact on our overall transformation effort; recommend updates to them as appropriate; and provide continuity throughout the transformation period.<BR><BR> <BR>This teams responsibilities shall include continuous review and recommended refinements to the above base documents; preparing measurable training and exercise products, assessing training and exercises; preparing and leading transformation training and exercise after action reports; leading joint tactical discussions; and working side-by-side with USFK Action Officers and appropriate J Staff to ensure all transformation training and exercise requirements and deadlines are met.  <BR><BR> <BR><BR>This team will continuously keep USFK leadership apprised of transformation progress to include recommended adaptations to ensure all USFK Transformation requirements are met by FY 2012.<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>This requirement is for design, fabrication, performance, and acceptance testing of the Relay and Reduction Optics (RRO) system which will be used in a sensor test chamber operating under simulated deep space vacuum, temperature, and background radiation conditions.  This procurement will include a three-optical-component assembly that will provide the proper interface between a dual resistive emitter array projection system and an existing collimating optical system to produce an IR radiation projection system referred to as the Short Focal Length Collimator (SFLC) system.  The SFLC will complement the current collimating optical system in 7V that has a much longer focal length and thus has limited projection over the desired field of view (FOV).  The RRO optical system design must address analysis of IR radiometric throughput and spectral issues; mounting techniques for precision optics; low temperature thermal and thermo/structural design and analysis; selection and preparation of optical materials for cryogenic application and repeated thermal cycling; and control of contamination and optical surface scatter.  The performance of this optical system shall be demonstrated under high-vacuum, cryogenic operational conditions prior to final acceptance at AEDC.  Delivery of the Relay and Reduction Optics is expected within 24 weeks following contract award.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination to AEDC, Arnold AFB TN.  This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.

<SUBJECT>Automated Virtual Information Production Support System (AVIPSS) III
<SOLNBR>FA8750-08-R-0182
<CONTACT>Joseph L. Facciolo, Contract Specialist, Phone (315) 330-4981, Fax (315) 330-8078, Email facciolj@rl.af.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to provide additional information to all interested parties in the solicitation process for the Automated Virtual Information Production Support System (AVIPSS) III – formally Solicitation No. FA8750-07-R-0016 and to perform market research that will glean  useful information from industry that can incorporated in the solicitation.  The Government is (a)  requesting industry input regarding best commercial practices for possible use in finalizing the acquisition strategy, (b)  providing another opportunity for potential sources to provide capability packages in the event that the change in NAICS code impacts the determination not to conduct this acquisition as a small business set-aside, and (c)  also serves as a notice of proposed contract action.  The primary customer for the AVIPSS III Program is the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.  NASIC, under the command of the AF Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Agency, is the Air Force’s single air and space intelligence production center and the primary DoD producer of foreign aerospace intelligence. The NASIC production program responds to guidance provided by their headquarters, AF ISR Agency, the Air Staff, and the DIA. The AVIPSS III Program supports NASIC mission responsibilities in Electronic Combat assigned by HQ USAF and in the DoDIIS Migration Systems development and deployment as assigned by the DIA and HQ USAF. AFRL RRS has a requirement to build on and extend the current National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) automated threat database production system, consisting of the Automated Virtual Information Production Support System (AVIPSS), the Knowledge Pre-positioning System (KPS), Virtual Production System (VPS), Virtual Intelligence Production (VIP), NASIC Metadata Repository (NMR) and the Virtual Intelligence Product Retrieval Environment (VIPRE).  The AVIPSS, KPS, VPS, VIP, NMR, and VIPRE are components critical to this effort.  The design, development, implementation, and integration of new components with the AVIPSS, KPS, VPS, VIP, NMR and VIPRE will provide the Information Technology (IT) solution to NASIC’s corporate objectives for pre-positioning its analytical knowledge and for enabling customers and other intelligence analysts to build a custom and persistent product well into the future.  The effort will include the development and/or expansion of parametric information models; design of physical and logical database structures; development, implementation, and enhancement of the capability to interactively maintain data within the databases; implementation and enhancement of the capabilities to derive tailored specialized products from the textual and parametric databases and multimedia object repositories; design of high level constructs that dynamically incorporate database information into indivisible groups of objects that answer customer questions; and the development and implementation of customer friendly tools and interfaces.  Further, this effort supports the development, enhancement, implementation and maintenance of national level systems for the input, translation, and retrieval of all-source information and for the continued design, development, implementation and deployment of a DoD Intelligence Information System (DODIIS)-wide information notification system.  Anticipated deliverables include software, databases, and technical documentation.  To qualify as a responsible contractor, the Offeror must have an appropriate number of key personnel (approximately 40-45 cleared personnel) that can have access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) or be clearable (Final U.S. Top Secret Clearance without waiver and a Special Background Investigation either on record or in process) that will be available for assignment to this effort immediately upon contract award.  

Initially this solicitation was to be based on a Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity, Cost Plus Fixed Fee Completion, Research and Development contract with an ordering period of 48 months and maximum ordering amount of $49.9M – See original Sources Sought posted on Jan 18, 2007 for more details of this program.  It has since been determined that this effort will be a Performance Based Service Acquisition (PBSA).  PBSA involves acquisition strategies, methods, and techniques that describe the measurable outcomes rather than direct performance processes. PBSA is structured around defining a service requirement in terms of performance standards and performance measurement and providing contractors the latitude to determine how to meet those standards.  At this time the exact contract type --  i.e. Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Firm Fixed Price, Cost Plus Incentive Fee, etc. -- has not been decided and we would like industry to provide suggestions as to what type of contract they feel would best fit the work to be performed under the AVIPSS III PBSA effort, and why.  One important characteristic is that AVIPSS III performance requires software enhancements and resolutions to software requirements and problems that cannot be identified consistently or definitively in advance of tasking due to the fast-changing volatile environment in which NASIC and its customers operate; therefore the work description for each order will be broader in scope to allow for flexibility.  This creates a conundrum – how do we develop and evaluate performance standards for requirements that are not known in advance?  To help solve this dilemma we are requesting that industry also provide input on performance standards, performance thresholds, and surveillance methods, as well as sample customer survey questions, that will allow for a reliable method for evaluating contractor performance, measuring performance outcomes, and providing contractor incentives for superior performance.  The Government is interested in industry input on what the customary commercial business practices are for procuring custom computer programming services in a fast-changing environment where detailed requirements are not known in advance.  Provide input on the above issues directly to the Contract Specialist, Joseph Facciolo, at Joseph.Facciolo@rl.af.mil no later than 30 MAY 2008.  

Evaluation of the capability packages received in response to the previous Sources Sought announcement resulted in a determination that a small business set-aside was not warranted.  This notice seeks to provide an additional opportunity to all small businesses that have the resources to perform this effort to provide a statement of capabilities and information demonstrating management and technical experience on similar acquisitions and resource necessary to successfully compete for this award (See Numbered Note 25).  Provide information on at least 3 contracts for similar work within the past 5 years.  Include complete references, contract titles, dollar values, points of contact and telephone numbers.  The Government will evaluate relevant experience information based on (1) information provided by the respondent;  (2) information obtained from the references provided by the respondent; and/or (3) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  In addition to the statement of capabilities, please provide answers to the following questions:  (1) Does your company intend to submit a proposal in response to the upcoming solicitation as a prime contractor?  (2)  How many people does your company employ?  (3)  How many TS/SCI cleared personnel are currently available?  (4)  Will you need to hire additional personnel to perform this effort?  (5)  Is your company’s cost accounting system approved by DCAA or DCMA?  If not, how would your company financially administer a cost-reimbursement type contract?  (6)  Are there any other factors concerning your company’s ability to perform the upcoming effort that the Air Force should consider?

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541511 and the small business size standard is average annual receipts of $23M.  Respondents are requested to indicate whether they are a large business, small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, historically black college or university (HBCU) or minority institution (MI) (as defined by the clause at DFARS 252.226-7000).  Respondents are also requested to indicate their status as a foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign nation employees on this effort.  Foreign participation is excluded at the prime contractor level.

A technical read library (on CD disk) relating to the subject area of this acquisition is available for review by potential offerors.  Access may be gained by contacting the Program Manager, Mr. James Sieffert, at 315-330-2344.  The library contains sensitive technical data; therefore, prior to the read library disk being mailed, respondents must submit a copy of an approved DD Form 2345, “Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement,” which certifies the respondent is on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL), along with a letter from the Data Custodian designated on that form, authorizing access by whomever will be reviewing the library, to ATTN:  Mr. James Sieffert, AVIPSS III Program Manager, at Air Force Research Laboratory/RIEB, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505, or fax to his attention at 315-330-3038, James.Sieffert@us.af.mil.

In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. Before consulting with an Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer, Rebecca S.P. Willsey, (315) 330-4710, Rebecca.Willsey@rl.af.mil, for resolution. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (AUG 2005) will be incorporated into the resultant contract. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the Ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.  Further, the Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The Ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Consulting an Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).   If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, concerned parties may contact the following AFRL Ombudsman: Susan Hunter, Building 15, RM225, 1864 4th Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7130 FAX: 937-255-5036 COM: 937-255-7754.

<DESC><p>BOTUSA, the CDC collaboration with the government of Botswana, is conducting a Phase III randomized, placebo controlled trial of the safety and efficacy of a single daily oral dose of the antiretroviral (ARV) Truvada for the prevention of HIV infection among 1200 sexually active young adults in Botswana (henceforth referred to as TDF2 trial). Such trials are commonly referred to oral chemoprophylaxis or pre-exposure prophylaxis trials (PrEP).
<p>The purpose of this project is to systematically identify general community and key stakeholders' (HIV positive persons, clinicians who care for HIV positive persons) attitudes, knowledge, concerns, and potential misconceptions about a Phase II/III randomized, placebo controlled trial of the safety and efficacy of a single daily oral dose of the antiretroviral Truvada for the prevention of HIV infection currently being conducted among sexually active young adults in Botswana. Specifically, the contractor, in conjunction with CDC, will conduct a multi-wave, longitudinal community based research study employing administration and data-entry of survey and qualitative key informant interviews. This study will be conducted throughout the life of the TDF2 trial, including active enrollment, follow-up, data analysis, announcement of trial results, and for 3-6 months after the announcement of the results. This end date for this is anticipated to be late 2010.</p>

<DESC>The Department intends to issue a purchase order to Educational Testing Service (ETS), 666 Rosedale Road MS 85-D, Princeton, NJ 08541-0001 to examine trends in mean Praxis II assessment scores from the mid-1990s to the present time among all individuals who took certain Praxis II assessments in Mathematics, English, and Science. 

ETS is uniquely positioned to conduct this study because ETS maintains all of the Praxis II testing data from all states that administer the Praxis II exams.  ETS has permission from the states to conduct analyses on these data as long as the analyses to not disaggregate and identify the names of individual states.    Because ETS already has access to these data and permission from the states to conduct analyses of the data when aggregating from many states, there is no need for ETS to seek additional permission.  Finally, ETS researchers are very familiar with the Praxis II data and have expertise in conducting analyses with the data. Due to these factors ETS is uniquely qualified to perform the needed work and is the only source that will satisfy ED’s requirement. This purchase order shall not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.  The anticipated period of performance is 34 weeks.  All responsible sources, however, may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC has a requirement for inertia testing design and verification.[SPECIFICATIONS]The specifications are:Pad Abort 1 Crew Module Mass Moment of Inertia Test Hardware1.  INTRODUCTIONThe NASA Orion Flight Test Office is planning to conduct a series of flight tests of theCrew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) Launch Abort System (LAS).  For Pad Abort flight tests,the Flight Test Article (FTA), which includes the LAS and a boilerplate Crew Module (CM)will be launched from the launch pad at the US Armys White Sands Missile Range.  ForAscent Abort flight tests, the FTA will be separated from the Abort Test Booster (ATB) inflight.  One of the flight test objectives is to collect flight test data and use it to computethe FTA aerodynamic coefficients.  In order to calculate the aerodynamic coefficients,the CM Mass Moment of Inertia (MMoI) will need to be calculated and/or measured.  TheNASA Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) is planning to conduct tests in the ShuttleHangar (SH) to obtain the CM MMoI.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of ESRI Software.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST has identified that ESRI is the only vendor whose product, in terms of value, features and supportability, meets CA/CSTs requirements. ESRI meet all key requirements as stated by CA/CST/TI management, allowed for CA engineers to manage updates without interaction with the internet. In short, ESRI was the only product that meets all needs, was supportable and provided superior value compared to competitors.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.
The ideal product for the GSM&M Display Layer will offer a solid framework for high quality, rich interface development. The product should facilitate a quick time to market for the Display Layer product and offer the ability to enrich the Display Layer solutions with relative ease. Specifically, the ideal tool should be able to add web services, websites, or data sources without the need to rewrite or edit core Display Layer code.<BR><BR>In accordance with the GSM&M Display Layer Concept of Operations document and Requirements document, the map rendering services of the GSM&M Display Layer will follow the customers requirements, focusing on five critical areas (summarized below).	Customer vision  CA/CST management has expressed the need for the product to render objects on the map, zoom in/out, and pan with relative ease. As well, layout should be uncluttered, logical, and easy to interpret.	Security  the solution shall be aligned with DoS security posture, and not expose any sensitive information to organizations outside of DoS.	Ease of development  the ideal tool should simplify solution development and modification.	Cost  if possible, the tool should have fixed cost, or the ability to accurately assess the total cost of ownership of the tool. The tool should offer a reduction in cost of developing the GSM&M Display Layer solution.	Architecture  In accordance with CA/CSTs documented development standards, the tool should be written with, or use Microsoft C#, and have libraries and components supporting the Microsoft .NET development framework.Products ConsideredThe following companies offer GIS-centric and map-based solutions and frameworks of the Display Layer GUI product market analysis. Note that, over the course of the market analysis, it was discovered the vendors of the GIS/map-based interfaces have very different methods for pricing and licensing their products and services. 	Google Maps and Google Earth	Microsoft Maps and Microsoft Virtual Earth	ESRI ArcGIS Server	ASP Maps	MapQuest<BR><BR>

<DESC>NASA Glenn Research Center plans to issue a Request For Procurement for thematerial scale-up, design, manufacturing, and fabrication of high energy andultra-high energy lithium-based cell chemistries for energy storage supporting the nextgeneration of NASA aerospace vehicles, including Altair (the Lunar Lander),Extravehicular Activities, and Lunar Surface Systems (rovers and other surface assets). Advanced lithium-ion batteries that are safe and possess high specific energies areneeded to meet mission requirements. The energy storage subsystem must have minimal masswhile meeting the power requirements of the spacecraft, without compromising safety. Atthe cell level, developed cell chemistries and concepts shall deliver specific energiesof at least 260 Wh/kg at C/10 and at 0 degrees C to 100% depth-of-discharge and shall becapable of meeting power requirements while operating at 0 degrees C to +30 degrees C.Maximum continuous discharge rate requirements are expected to be between C/5 and C/2.Charge rate requirements will be benign. Cycle life requirements are 100 to 200 cycles to80% depth-of-discharge with at least 80% of the initial capacity remaining atend-of-life. Sample battery cell components of interest for meeting the desired cell-level performancerequirements and representative manufacturing processes will be provided to the aerospacecell vendor. Based upon manufacturability studies of the novel materials on thelithium-based vendors equipment and performance evaluation in small capacity cells, theaerospace vendor shall scale-up the preferred materials in sufficient quantities tomanufacture and deliver high energy and/or ultra-high energy lithium-based cells of ato-be-determined capacity at a Technology Readiness Level 4 (Component and/or breadboardvalidation in laboratory environment). NASA will evaluate and test the cells to elevatethe cells to a TRL 6 (System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevantenvironment (ground or space)).

<DESC>The Social Security Act requires the Commissioner to enter into contracts with States to secure death certificate data.  Under these existing contracts, the States must submit this data to SSA within 90-120 days of the month of the person’s death.  This contract supports SSA’s requirement to receive death data more timely and accurately to administer its programs more effectively.  The contractor shall provide consulting services and test State OVS-2 software related to the electronic death registration process.  This EDR affects Title II and Title XVI beneficiaries and other Federal agencies’ beneficiaries.  EDR will enable SSA to realize significant administrative and program savings by terminating Social Security benefits more timely because of death.  Other federal benefit paying agencies will avoid incorrect payments by terminating their benefits more timely based on receipt of SSA’s death master file.  SSA anticipates a sole source award to the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS).  NAPHSIS is a national association that represents state vital records and public health information statistics offices which is based in the Washington, D.C. area, and is a not for profit agency.  

This contract is follow-on work which was provided under current contract (SS00-05-60070).  The contractor shall test and submit a report of the State’s OVS-2 software and Fact of Death files for an estimated 1-21 States. Also, a  report of testing of the OVS-2 software and Fact of Death for States that have previously implemented EDR using OVS-1 and are migrating to OVS-2.  Testing will be performed when these States notify SSA that they intend to migrate to OVS-2.  

Vendors capable of meeting SSA’s requirements for consulting and testing services for EDR must present electronic/written evidence of such capability by close of business on May 19, 2008. The Government does not intend to pay for information received and does not intend to provide evaluation results to the sender.  Instead, the knowledge obtained from information submitted will be used to determine whether there appears to be a competitive source in the marketplace.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Nora V Tyson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-5229, Fax 301-443-3238, Email ntyson@psc.gov
<DESC>The Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA),
Office of the Administrator, (OA), through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to The National Alliance of Multi-Ethnic Behavioral Health Associations (NAMBHA). 

In order to reduce the current fragmentation and begin to link “pockets of excellence” in reducing disparities, SAMHSA launched the National Network to Eliminate Disparities (NNED).  The mission of the NNED is to build and sustain a national network of organizations that will work collaboratively with diverse cultural, racial, ethnic and linguistic communities to promote policies, practices, standards and research to eliminate behavioral health disparities and disseminate new knowledge to the field.

NAMBHA occupies a unique role as the umbrella organization for the four national ethnic behavioral health associations that are dedicated to the elimination of disparities for diverse ethnic and racial communities. NAMBHA has brought together the National Asian American/Pacific Islander Mental Health Association, the National Latino Behavioral Health Association, the First Nations Behavioral Health Association, and the National Leadership Council for African American Behavioral Health in a joint, collaborative effort to address the behavioral needs of these diverse populations.  NAMBHA is the only national organization that has unified these associations to work collectively to improve the access, quality and outcomes of care for these populations.  NAMBHA has unique and specialized working relationships throughout these communities, having invested numerous human capital and social resources, to develop a unique infrastructure that is needed to advance the NNED and the work of its partners.  Due to NAMBHA’s unique organizational structure, access to multiple communities of color, and expertise in behavioral health disparities across all four major ethnic communities, it is uniquely positioned to best serve the needs of this contract.  Its structure enables NAMBHA to penetrate not just one single ethnic racial community but the four diverse populations targeted within the NNED.  

This contract is to support the work of the National Facilitation Center (NFC).  The NFC is responsible for coordinating the NNED partners and ensuring the efficient operation of the NNED which is a virtual network entity.  A key operational value is to develop regular and efficient coordination bringing minimal burden but high value to partners in the NNED. 

The Contractor will be expected to undertake the following tasks:

1.  Develop a strategy to systematically identify and invite CEBONS and KDCs to become partners in the NNED.
2.  Facilitate communication and relationship building among and across local communities and behavioral health providers of color across the U.S.
3.  Develop a process for identifying priorities for the NNED and selecting KDCs.
4.  Develop at least two Learning Clusters which consist of multiple CEBONS with a shared interest or priority issue that work closely with a KDC.  
5.  Provide fiscal and logistical support for the Learning Clusters.
6.  Provide fiscal and logistical support for the KDCs within the Learning Clusters.  
7.  Host and prepare agendas for the NNED Steward Group.
8.  Establish a feasible schedule, develop agendas and facilitate the Steward Group meetings.
9.  Facilitate the Steward Group Work Group #3 Growing the NNED:  Resources and Funding, and assist them in developing a plan for ongoing fiscal and operational sustainability for the NNED. 
10.  Plan for a National Conference of the NNED in 2009; prepare for logistics and identify and convene a Planning Group to develop the conference.
11.  Participate in monthly NNED Steering Committee calls with SAMHSA.
12.  Work in collaboration with the contractor that provides the virtual office development, knowledge management and website technology for the NNED.
13.  Provide a bi-monthly progress report to the NNED Project Officer. 
14.  Provide bi-monthly invoices aligned with the progress reports.

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

For further information, please contact Nora Tyson in Rm. 5C-03, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md. 20857 or on 301-443-5229.

GSA intends to award one (1) firm-fixed price Design-Build contract for all design and construction services necessary for Site Utility Upgrades ? 13.8kV Primary Electrical Distribution System located at the Nebraska Avenue Complex, 3801 Nebraska Avenue, NW,  Washington, DC, Procurement Request Number WPJ-08-0289.  The Site Utility Upgrades ? 13.8kV Primary Electrical Distribution System is a renovation of an electrical system on an occupied facility.   

Construction completion and final acceptance is expected to occur on or before December 29, 2010.  The anticipated cost for the project is between $20,000,000 and $30,000,000, and will consist of a renovation of an electrical system on an occupied facility.  

The proposed site covers approximately 25 acres, bounded by Nebraska Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue, Rock Creek, and private property.   The scope of the project is to provide a three feeder spot network electrical system including utility metering switchgear, underground distribution, underground vaults and connections to the existing buildings. Critical programmatic requirements include the need to keep the existing buildings in operation until the new system is complete.  

The design-build scope of work includes all engineering, civil, architectural /structural, design, construction, and other related services necessary to design and to construct the electrical distribution system.  Related services include, but are not limited to, geotechnical evaluation and monitoring, archaeological monitoring, permitting, testing and inspection during construction, commissioning and potential additional geotechnical analysis of the site.  Preliminary approvals have been secured from National Capital Planning Commission for the current design. Additional submissions will be required to secure final approvals.

This project requires the construction of a new primary electrical system including underground utility metering vault, duct banks, underground network transformer vaults, connection to existing electrical systems and removal of the existing electrical system, including salvage of designated equipment at the Nebraska Avenue Complex, together with associated mechanical, electrical and general construction work. Work includes selective demolition of existing electrical system and storm water system, and provision of underground electrical substation vaults, electrical distribution system, spot network substations, including transformers and switchgear, medium voltage metering switchgear and cabling, PEPCO connections, switchboards, connections to existing electrical system, temporary wiring, excavation and backfill and surface restoration and incidental related work. The Contractor shall provide the services of Registered Professional Engineers and Architects, experienced in the type of work contemplated, to provide design, calculations, field survey, drawings and specifications covering the work. Disciplines anticipated include electrical engineering, structural engineering, civil engineering, architecture, and horticulture.

The Contractor shall provide all the necessary labor, materials, supervision, management, quality control plan and testing to produce a finished and operational electrical system conforming to the contract documents.

The completed project will meet or exceed all Federal design and construction statutes, standards, and regulations, including but not limited to the energy goals stated in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards, and Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection measures.  

Interested Offerors must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, which has successfully and satisfactorily completed projects of similar complexity, scope, and size; or, which has similar projects currently in construction.

The design of the engineering and architectural features of the project shall be accomplished or reviewed and approved by engineers and architects registered to practice in their particular field within the District of Columbia.  The architect-engineer portion of this design-build entity must be a firm or joint venture having an existing active office located within the Washington, DC metropolitan area.  This existing active office will have the responsibility for providing the architectural and engineering services.

Offerors, individually or as a team, must have the capacity to obtain performance and payment bonding for up to 100% of the firm-fixed-price Design-Build Contract.

While the contractor?s personnel will have to satisfy the requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12, the Government does not anticipate that any special security clearance (i.e., TOP SECRET) will be required to participate in this procurement.  

GSA intends to award a firm-fixed-price design-build contract pursuant to the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 36.3 and Subpart 15.  The procurement will be completed in two phases: Phase 1 will be a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and Phase 2 will be a Request for Proposals (RFP).  During Phase 1, Offerors will prepare and submit their qualifications as specified in the RFQ package which will be issued on or about March 17, 2008, on the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  

The evaluation factors for Phase 1 are as follows:  1) Past Performance, 2) Technical Approach, 3) Specialized Experience and Technical Competency, and 4) Capability to Perform.  Refer to the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) package for details on the Phase 1 evaluation criteria and information for submittals.  On or about early May 2008, the Government anticipates extending invitations to a maximum of five (5) of the most highly qualified offerors to submit Phase 2 proposals, which will be due on or about mid June 2008.  The short listed firms will be issued the Request for Proposal (RFP) package and may undergo a presentation and review process under separate evaluation factors.  Details on the evaluation factors and submittals will be outlined in the RFP.  The Government anticipates making an award in July 2008.  This solicitation is not set-aside for small businesses.  However, this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (F.A.R. 52-219-19).  Any qualified responsible firm, including small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small businesses, is encouraged to participate as prime contractors, or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses, or as subcontractors.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, to reflect this commitment.  Consequently, an Offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction), must demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  YOU ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF UPLOAD OF THE RFQ AT THIS SITE AND REGISTER ON THE INTERESTED VENDOR LIST (IVL).

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Geologic Hazards Team (GHT), Central Region has entered into an agreement with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to support and assist the NRC in reviews of site license applications for nuclear power plants.  In coordination with the USGS-GHT, the Coastal & Marine Geology (CMG) Team of the USGS Western Region will provide additional support to review tsunami hazards for the NRC.  The NRC anticipates the filing of six (6) Early Site Permit (ESP) or Combined License (COL) application reviews that will need tsunami reviews in the next several years.  USGS-CMG technical expertise will be directed at reviewing hydrologic safety issues for each site as related to various aspects of tsunami hazards, including determination of probable maximum tsunami, tsunami source characterization, tsunami propagation, wave runup, drawdown, and inundation.  To augment this project, the USGS will utilize the abilities of a contractor who has sufficient regional and technical expertise in hydrodynamics and nearshore processes in the Central and Eastern United States to participate in these safety and environmental reviews of the site applications.
The USGS intends to obtain these services through a noncompetitive procurement in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 and the procedures of FAR Part 15.  The intended contractor is Professor Patrick J. Lynett, Texas Engineering Experiment Station, College Station, Texas.  Other interested concerns having the ability to meet the USGS' requirement may submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement at 17:00 local time.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  If no competitive opportunities exist, request for proposal 08WRSS0015 will be made available to Texas Engineering Experiment Station on or about 23 May 2008.
This notice and any resulting solicitation or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-25, effective 22 Apr 2008.

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers has need for a contract for Fabrication and Delivery of Miter Gates for Pike Island Locks and Dam located near Wheeling, West Virginia.  There are two sets of miter gates with each set consisting of two miter gate leaves (right hand and left hand).  One set will be the downstream gates and one set will be the upstream gates.  The gates will be constructed using various sizes of steel shapes and steel plate.  The majority of the steel items will conform to ASTM A-572 grade 50 and ASTM A709/A709M Grade 50F, Zone 2.  In addition, there are several stainless steel items including contact blocks and seal plates.  Connections will be accomplished by a combination of welding and bolting.

<CONTACT>Nadine A Utz, Phone 301-295-1380, Email nadineutz@usuhs.mil
<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), the Department of Defense (DoD) Medical School and Health Sciences University, hereby announces its intent to acquire on a sole source basis with Eppendorf North America in Westbury, NY an Eppendorf Model epMotion 5075 VAC and dispensing tools.

The epMotion 5075 VAC is a liquid handling robotic instrument/automated pipetting system used in molecular biology applications, more specifically in DNA/RNA purification and in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).  The following are critical components of the epMotion 5075 VAC:

1)	An integrated vacuum system in its platform.
2)	The ability to use disposable tips for a range of volumes from 1ul to 1000ul.
3)	Uses peltier cooling/heating devices (opposed to water baths).

To ensure integrity of the experiments the lack of “carryover” contamination from sample to sample is paramount.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on behalf of and as an agent of the Division of Strategic National Stockpile (DSNS) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified ventilators to be a necessity for pandemic flu preparedness and response.  The purpose of this solicitation is to award an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract for portable ventilators (all same make and model) with delivery to stockpile location(s) in support of pandemic flu preparedness and response.  Resulting awardee shall also be capable of providing re-supply kits, along with end-user training and sustain a 60-month (five year) maintenance support agreement that will include rotation of approximately one third of the ventilators shipping from Government location to offerors location for annual preventative and recertification maintenance.  The objective is to insure availability and consistency of product for stockpile and if need be, deployment in the event of pandemic flu outbreak.  The base contract period will be for one year (or less, depending on date of award), with one (4) option periods that may be exercised by the Government.   It is the Governments desire that the contractor shall provide consistent deliveries of portable ventilators and re-supply kits within an 18-month period.  Offerors are requested to propose a delivery schedule that can be accomplished within this timeframe or sooner and if not within this timeframe, include appropriate reasons why not.  Delivery shall be within the continental United States.  NOTE: Due to the national security and sensitive aspects of this program, information such as final delivery location(s) and point of contact(s) are considered confidential and as such shall only be disclosed to the resultant awardee.  Due to the confidential and sensitive nature of this procurement the contractor and affiliates shall be required to complete a confidentiality agreement within five (5) days of award.  Offeror must be able to provide standard commercial warranty term of at least one year after date of shipment as part of the mandatory characteristics (minimum requirements).  Because of the uniqueness of the DSNS stockpile program and this related procurement, the Government desires a warranty term that would begin at the point of 1st deployment of ventilators and continue through one year.  Offerors are encouraged to consider this optional characteristic provision and to include their response to this provision in the business proposal.  This provision as it is offered will be included in the price analysis portion of the evaluation.  Distributors/dealers are required to submit a letter from the manufacturer/s of the offered portable ventilators guaranteeing a source of supply for the term of the contract.  This letter must be from the manufacturer and on the manufacturers stationary.  Offers from distributors/dealers that do not submit the letter of commitment from the manufacturer will be rejected.

<DESC>Tuberculosis (TB) kills approximately two million people per year. Of the estimated two billion people infected with TB, eight million develop the disease annually. The disease threatens the poorest and most marginalized groups, disrupts the social fabric of society, and slows or undermines gains in economic development.  Ninety-five percent of all TB cases and 98% of all TB deaths occur in developing countries.  

The goal of USAID’s TB program is to halve TB prevalence and death rates in USAID assisted countries by 2015. By 2011, the objective is to achieve and sustain case detection of 70% and the successful treatment of at least 85% of those detected cases in USAID priority countries.  These objectives will be reached through the introduction and expansion of proven interventions in line with the WHO-recommended STOP TB Strategy, and they fully support the objectives and targets set forth in the STOP TB Partnerships Global Plan to STOP TB 2006 – 2010.  

USAID will continue to support and expand current efforts, provide global technical leadership for the introduction of new interventions, and build sustainable TB programs at the country level through the release of a new Tuberculosis IQC.  This new TB IQC  will implement and scale up all components of the STOP TB Strategy, including interventions to slow the emergence and spread of MDR-TB and XDR-TB. Task Orders  stemming from this award will support work in countries to build sustainable TB control programs that achieve USAID’s and the STOP TB Partnership’s targets.  In addition to scaling-up proven interventions, this award will provide a mechanism for contracting discrete global health technical leadership and technical assistance as needed.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS
FOR AFSO 21 COURSEWARE CONVERSION


1.  The Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Randolph Air Force Base (AFB), Texas, is soliciting interest and capability statements for a competitive acquisition for converting approximately 3300 hours of classroom instruction into computer based training (CBT).  This will impact 100 – 150 courses to distance learning.  The Government will provide a list of candidate courses to the provider.  The list is currently being refined and will be finalized at time of solicitation.  Some courses will be identified for immediate conversion.  Other courses will require feasibility studies to be performed.  Courses will consist primarily of knowledge based refresher or supplemental training.  Interactivity levels will range from level 1 thru 3.  It is expected that 25-30% will be level 1 with 60% at level 2 and 10-15% at level 3.  

2.  Courseware will be SCORM conformant in accordance with DODI 1322.26.  Results of SCORM self test will be required.  Self test software is available at http://www.adlnet.gov/downloads/index.aspx

3.  Courseware will be Section 508 conformant.  Completed checklist available at https://adlhub.golearn.csd.disa.mil/hub/tools_resources/tr_checklist.asp will be required to ensure conformance.  

4.  Provider will provide all documentation required by Air Force policy (AFI 36-2201, AETCI 36-2203, AETCI 36-2209).  These policies and publications can be found at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/

5.  The contractor shall provide sufficient, qualified personnel to perform the required services.

6.  The purpose of publicizing notices for potential actions is to increase competition, to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and to assist small businesses in general in obtaining contracts and subcontracts.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), but instead is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to issuing the RFP.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 611710 applies.  Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their business size for code 611710, particularly if they are a small business (the small business size standard is $6.5 million).  “Small business” means small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business.  If business size is transitioning to other than “small business” in the next 90 days, please indicate as such.

7.  This sources sought notice is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  It is not the intention of the Government to enter into a contract based on this notice or to otherwise pay for information solicited.  If the Government decides to contract for this effort at a later date, we will issue an RFP to industry for a period of 2 years.  The anticipated award date is September 2008.

8.  It is the Government’s intent to award one contract.  The Government currently plans to issue an unrestricted solicitation; however, it reserves the right to make this a small business (SB) set-aside based on the interest and technical capabilities received from SB concerns.  (Under an unrestricted solicitation, large businesses will be required to submit a subcontracting plan.)  Therefore, it is requested that SB concerns provide sufficient written information supporting their capability to perform (items H, I and J below).

9.  All interested parties are invited to provide the following information for your company/institution and for any teaming or joint venture partners:

A.  Company/Institute Name and CAGE code.
B.  Mailing Address.
C.  Point of Contact (to include phone/fax and e-mail).
D.  Web site, if applicable.
E.  State if your company is registered under NAICS code 611710 or not.
F.  State whether your company is small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned small, HUB-Zone, or 8(a) certified business concern.
G.  State the size of your company in terms of personnel.
H.  Degree of experience converting classroom instruction into computer based training (CBT). 
I.  Identify any past or current Government contracts for converting courseware within the last three years.
J.  Briefly describe how your company can satisfy the requirements described above, and your associated technical capabilities.

10.  Responses are due no later than 1600 CST, Monday, 29 May 2008, and shall be electronically submitted to both the Contract Specialist, 2Lt Bryce Fiacco, at bryce.fiacco@randolph.af.mil and the Contracting Officer, Mr. Kevin Shackleford, at kevin.shackleford@randolph.af.mil in a Word 97 (or above) or Adobe PDF file format.

11.  Questions relative to this market research should be sent electronically to both 2Lt Bryce Fiacco and Kevin Shackleford.

12.  NO PHONE INQUIRIES.  All communications shall be in writing.

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party.

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY for market research purposes to identify interested vendors for the requirement detailed below. A formal Solicitation, with Performance Work Statements or Technical Exhibits is not available for review at this time. Information obtained from this sources sought notice may result in a future formal Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government reserves the right to set-aside any subsequent acquisition based upon known sources and/or responses to this synopsis.
<p>The Air Force SEEK EAGLE Office (AFSEO) Electromagnetic Compatibility/Electromagnetic Interference Team (46 SK/SKI) requires accurate computational tools to support its flight certification activity. Computational Electromagnetic tools aid the AFSEO staff in determining Electromagnetic Compatibility/Electromagnetic Interference (EMC/EMI) and Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance effects for intra-aircraft and aircraft-stores integration.</p>
<p>One principal Computational Electromagnetic Model (CEM) tool used by the AFSEO is General Electromagnetic Model for the Analysis of Complex Systems (GEMACS) because it has many capabilities required by AFSEO. GEMACS is supported by the Computational Electromagnetic Modeling Framework (CEM Framework) for geometry model development, data post processing, and visualization. To realize the full potential of GEMACS and to provide the computational electromagnetic capability that the AFSEO needs to perform its mission, additional modifications, upgrades, and enhancements of GEMACS and the CEM Framework need to be added to the core High Performance Computer (HPC) capability of GEMACS.</p>
<p>This current effort is partially sponsored by the Institute for HPC Applications to Air Armament. Institute for HPC Applications for Air Armament (IHAAA) requires specific documentation of their sponsored projects.</p>
<p>The principal objective of this contract effort is to provide the ability to solve realistically sized electromagnetic problems of high resolution using distributed memory architecture on HPC at the DoD Major Shared Resource Centers. This objective is achieved by implementing the GEMACS and CEM Framework enhancements. The fundamental goal of this project is to modernize GEMACS and the CEM Framework to allow their full use on HPC systems and to expand their capabilities through the modifications, upgrades, and enhancements.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code for this effort is 541712; size standard in number of employees is 500. Period of performance is TBD.</p>
<p>The capabilities package should include information detailing similar efforts currently conducted by firm. In addition to a capabilities package, firms responding to this announcement should include company name, cage code, point of contact, address, and indicate whether they are a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and/or women-owned small business.</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis for market research purposes only and is not a RFP. No solicitation is being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Participation is strictly voluntary with no cost or obligation to be incurred by the Government.</p>
<p>Responses submitted should be original and one copy, a maximum of _5_ pages in length, and must be received within no later than 3:00 pm local time on 30 May 2008. Responses should be sent to AAC/PKES, 205 West D Avenue, Suite 467, Eglin AFB, FL 32542, Attn: Jason Barnes.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Public Debt, on behalf the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) seeks a contractor who can provide consulting services to recommend readability criteria for dynamic text in variable message signs (VMS).  

This is a Sources Sought Notice and not a request for quotations.  The purpose of this announcement is to determine the number of potential qualified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Hubzone, Small, or Large Businesses who can furnish the services below.

Please provide your size standard and your Duns # for your business.  Please provide a synopsis of your capabilities to provide the services as stated below.  Please discuss any similar services currently or previously performed.


PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

PROJECT
CONSULTING SERVICES TO RECOMMEND READABILITY CRITERIA FOR DYNAMIC TEXT IN VARIABLE MESSAGE SIGNS (VMS) 

	
BACKGROUND
Variable message signs (VMS) must often present more information than will fit in a single view.  Longer messages will therefore be displayed in a dynamic format, either by paging or by some form of scrolling or streaming.  [Paging information is static, but a number of pages of information are shown sequentially to convey the full message; scrolling moves the text down the sign from the top to the bottom; streaming moves the text across the sign from right to left].

A working group of the ANSI A117.1 committee is developing standards for dynamic sign displays.  The committee has asked the Access Board to support research that will determine the effect of moving signage on the comprehension of readers who have vision impairments.  The research shall identify a speed of presentation that is appropriate and effective for low-vision users for each dynamic format -- paged, scrolled, and streamed text.

OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to assess the readability of dynamically displayed text by readers who have vision loss.  The project will identify the optimum display speed for each of the three types of dynamic display format and will assess the relative usability to low-vision readers of the three types being investigated.  Existing findings suggest that streaming has the highest utility, but the research is far from definitive. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This is anticipated to be a three-phase, multi-year project.  Phase 1 will assess the current state of practice and provide an annotated synthesis of the research literature on dynamic VMS with emphasis on issues related to visually impaired sign readers. Phase 2 will plan and develop human factors research that can test the usability of a range of VMS features and Phase 3 will conduct that research and provide a report of findings to the Board.   

TASKS AND DELIVERABLES
Phase 1:  Literature and State of the Art/Practice Review
A synthesis of the state-of-the art and state-of-the-practice in VMS design and operation will be conducted with special emphasis on the technology and limits of dynamic text displays. This task may be accomplished through a research and literature review and interviews with manufacturers of VMS devices, both domestic and international.  A concurrent study of relevant issues in the literature/practice of low-vision research shall also be undertaken.  Phase 1 results shall be used in Phase 2 to isolate a candidate set of dynamic VMS treatments that shall be tested for effectiveness in Phase 3. 

Phase 2:  Develop Detailed Testing Plan
This phase shall consist of the development of a detailed test plan to evaluate the candidate set of dynamic VMS treatments identified in Phase 1. The research plan shall use the standard scientific method including identifying the problem, developing testable hypotheses, testing those hypotheses, analyzing the results of those tests, and formulating conclusions and recommendations based on the results. The plan shall include details of the methodology and procedures used, including the type of VMS used in the research, the types of dynamic displays tested, the speeds of presentation that shall be evaluated, the number of subjects and the types and severity of their visual impairments, and the kinds of statistical analyses that shall be used. The test plan shall be delivered to the Access Board at the conclusion of this phase for review and approval.

Phase 3:  Conduct Human Factors Research
This phase shall involve implementing the test plan developed in Phase 2.  This shall entail acquiring and setting up the experimental apparatus, recruiting, scheduling, and testing the subjects, and collecting, organizing, and analyzing the data.  This shall lead to the development of recommendations for the use of dynamic text on VMS for readers who have vision impairments.  At the conclusion of Phase 3 the contractor shall provide the Access Board with a report detailing all aspects of the data collection effort.



PRINT AND ELECTRONIC ACCESSIBILITY
Print documents shall be provided in standard black and white reproducible print, in large print, and on disk in a Word/Windows 2000 file with a text description of all figures and charts.   Graphic elements, such as photographs, drawings, icons, charts, graphs, etc., shall be provided as separate non-embedded files in GIF or JPEG format.  Information or data in tabular or columnar form shall be presented within a table, not by using tab spacing or text boxes.  For tables other than those having simple rows and columns (i.e., those with split columns or rows), a straight text alternative shall be provided.  

In addition, electronic files of all documents shall be provided, coded in PDF format and in HTML format following the Board’s standards for electronic and information technology (36 CFR 1194.23 (c)).  Internet-ready and presentation software shall include text descriptions in "alt" tags for all graphic images.  Audio files shall be accompanied by text transcripts.  Video files shall be captioned (e.g., using SAMI or other appropriate technologies).

<DESC>A.  DESCRIPTIONThis is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  The National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration (NASA) at the John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is seeking ideas,opinions, and concepts from industry, academia, and other prospective parties to identifypotential methods for the demolition, removal and salvage of the Fixed Service Structure(FSS) and Rotating Service Structure (RSS) at Launch Complex 39B. This is not a notice of solicitation and does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal,Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation; therefore, do not request a copy of thesolicitation. This RFI is for internal NASA planning purposes only and seeks to provideinterested parties an opportunity to assist NASA in planning.  This notice is not to beconstrued as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract, nor will theGovernment pay for the information submitted in response to this request.NASA intends to use the information provided in response to this RFI to determine, in itssole discretion, the potential methods available for demolition of the structures.NASA will review all comments/suggestions received, but shall be under no obligation torespond to industry comments or to incorporate any comments/suggestions into anyresultant drawings and specifications.	NASA reserves the right to enter into discussionswith one or more parties responding to this RFI if deemed to be in the best interest ofthe Government.  B. PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF WORKThe purpose of this RFI is to gather planning information on prospective methods ofdemolition, and suggestions for reuse/recycling for removed material.  This request islimited to the FSS and RSS at Launch Complex 39B, it does not include the concrete padsurface, surrounding facilities, Launch Complex 39A or any other KSC facilities, but doesinclude appropriate demolition of elevator, stairs, and stairwell unless required tosupport remaining structure.  Seeking cost estimates, demolition schedule, method of material removal and anygovernment requirements to support (example: rail car available at X location).  The RFIshould consider the balance of cost and schedule to maximize benefits for the government.This project includes demolishing the entire RSS structure from the pivot hinge at thesoutheast corner of the FSS back to the rail trucks but not the rail or Rail Bridgecrossing the flame trench.  The approximate weight of the RSS is 4500 tons of mostlysteel but also contains copper, aluminum and stainless steel.This includes the FSS from its footprint on the pad surface upward and on all sidesincluding everything being supported by the FSS structure but extending outside thefootprint above the pad surface.  This does not include the walkway extending northbeyond the north face of the FSS walkway which extends to the concrete structure locatedjust north of the FSS footprint (9099 interface facility).  The existing crew escapesystem cables and slide basket platform on the 195 foot level shall be removed.  FSSdemolition shall be to the pad surface with cutting and or capping all lines extendingthrough to below the pad surface.   A complete demolition design will be performed and provided to the demolition contractorwith specific hazardous material analysis and special safety requirements.  The primaryrestriction to this demolition will be that no explosive methods shall be used in the padarea nor shall any damage be allowed to the pad surface.  Pad surface must be left flat without tripping hazards.  All pipes and tubing must becapped or sealed at or below Pad surface. The Pad surface and subsurface must beprotected during demolition activities.  Pad surface can be assumed to support a 100-tontire crane and a live load on the Pad Terminal Connection Room (PTCR) roof of 500 psfuniformly distributed.	The soil bearing capacity under the Pad surface is assumed to be2500 psf.The contractor will be provided a lay-down area adjacent to the demolition site (outsidethe perimeter fence) to disassemble and temporarily store materials.  A high priority indetermining the method of demolition is the quick removal of material from site in orderto avoid complications or interference with launches.  One proposed lay-down site is onthe crawler-way to Pad B.  The contractor may propose other sites.  Proposal for removalof materials may use the rail, barge or vehicular transportation from the site.  The Padis approximately .3 miles from the rail.  The distance to the barge is approximately 4.3miles from Pad B.  Depending on proposed timeframe for demolition, the demolition mayrequire stopping and securing for Ares 1 test flight.All demolition debris shall become property of the contractor, who shall be responsiblefor removal from KSC or transportation to the KSC landfill.  All concrete debris shall bereduced to less than 2 feet in diameter prior to transportation to KSC landfill.  ExportControl requires that all items must be rendered unusable and unrecognizable prior toremoval from KSC.  Historic preservation/salvage is not a requirement for this structure. Failure to respond to this RFI does not exclude any interested party from futureconsideration for proposals for design/construction/demolition which may be announced orsolicited by NASA.C.  TYPES OF USES SOUGHT AND LIMITATIONS The goal of this RFI is to develop Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) costs, identify viablemethods for demolition and disposal, and to determine the capability and capacity ofinterested parties offering ideas to successfully implement and manage such activitieswith NASA.  Prior contracts at KSC are not required to submit a response to this RFI,however prior experience with large scale demolition projects is essential to providingan accurate assessment and response.D.  SITE VISITA site visit will be conducted on Friday, May 30, 2008, at 9 a.m. There will be only onesite visit offered. Anyone who plans to attend the site visit must give 48 hours writtennotice to the responsible Contracting Officer (CO), Joseph Bell.  ALL SITE VISITATTENDEES WILL NEED TO HAVE A TEMPORARY AREA ACCESS (TAA) BADGE WITH NUMBERS FOR LAUNCHCOMPLEX (LC) 39B IN ORDER TO HAVE ACCESS TO LC39B DURING THE SITE VISIT.  This TAA badgeis necessary IN ADDITION, to your access badge.

<CONTACT>Stephen J. Yuter, Contract Specialist, Phone 2026162146, Fax 2026167876, Email stephen.yuter@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Office of Acquisition Management (OAQ) is synopsizing its intent to award a sole source contract, pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, to SRA International for the NETLEADS information system (Law Enforcement Analysis Data System). The NETLEADS system is currently in use by the Systems Development Division (SDD), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) to perform intelligence and investigative analysis functions in support of the DHS law enforcement mission. SRA International is the sole developer and provider of NETLEADS. NETLEADS provides an integrated common interface for the fusion of all source intelligence and investigations information, and supports DHS priorities for criminal enforcement, border enforcement, and management information and integration. It has been determined that it may be unrealistic for another vendor in the current marketplace to satisfy the requirements considering: (1) the significant customization for DHS, (2) the proprietary and patented nature of NETLEADS and its associated components, and (3) the specialized and subject matter expertise of the personnel requirements. Market research efforts have yielded SRA as the only responsible source, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is currently available. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. Responses/proposals received within ten (10) calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open basis is solely within the discretion of the Government. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services. All contractors who provide goods/services to DHS must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR). The solicitation will require online certifications and representations (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov. Failure to comply with ORCA registration may make the offeror ineligible for award. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirements by submitting literature (white papers), technical data for the item, and past performance data no later than 4:00 p.m. (EST) 23 May 2008 to Stephen J. Yuter, Contract Specialist, DHS/ICE, Office of Acquisition Management, IT Services Branch, 425 I Street, N.W., Room 2208, Washington, D.C. 20536-0001. Questions may be submitted by email to stephen.yuter@dhs.gov.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The U.S. Coast Guard intends TO Procure contractor services USCG LEVEL III REPORTING SYSTEM. This notice is for a commercial item in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued. Therefore, please read this entire notice, the instructions herein, and the attachment documents carefully.  This acquisition is on an Unrestricted basis.  
Scope:
Situation Overview:
The United States Coast Guard (USCG) has a rich history of having the some of the best trained, well prepared people in support of our country.  USCG conducts almost 700 training courses each year for more than 40,000 students at seven regional training centers located throughout the United States.  Approximately one-third of these courses are conducted by the Department of Defense (DOD), one-third are conducted by USCG and the final third are commercial training programs.   

A key measurement following any of the training programs are Terminal Performance Objectives (TPOs).   There can be between 5 and 100 TPOs per training course with varying levels of complexity.  A Kirkpatrick Level III evaluation is conducted for each course six months after completion to understand each course participant’s utilization TPOs from each course.  The Kirkpatrick Level III evaluation is provided to each participant and to their supervisor in order to determine where gaps may exist in course effectiveness and participant skills. 

Currently each training center has its own Workgroup in SurveySolutions/EFM and will be responsible for creation of the evaluations for their particular training courses and distribution to participants in the 6 month timeframe. The USCG intends to leverage its existing investment in Perseus|WebSurveyor’s SurveySolutions/EFM online feedback solution to standardize the approach to conducting Kirkpatrick Level III evaluations. As part of a new approach, USCG intends to deploy a standard online survey instrument to each course participant and to their supervisors. Each instrument will be built to enable USCG to obtain feedback on the individual’s skills, as well as key demographic information about the individual’s rating, rank and TPOs.

As USCG implements this program, it is seeking to develop a reporting portal in which the results of all training course evaluations can be displayed and examined at a detail level by several different levels of management within the CG training organization, including course instructors, program managers, training center managers and analysts and curriculum planners at USCG headquarters. Key attributes of the reporting portal that will need to be developed include the ability to provide reports across the organization and the flexibility to easily and economically meet changing reporting requirements over time. In addition, while reports are currently envisioned to be text-tables only, USCG would like to have the flexibility over time to upgrade the reports to graphical formats, and to take full advantage of the Perseus|WebSurveyor application programming interface (API) to be able to more tightly integrate its own internal systems and SurveySolutions/EFM. 


Objectives:
&#61607;	Provide USCG with a reporting portal that will enable the organization to aggregrate data from standardized online Kirkpatrick Level III evaluations 

&#61607;	Provide report users with the ability to drill deeply into the data

Strategies:
&#61607;	Utilize the expertise of the Perseus|WebSurveyor Research Services team to develop a flexible online reporting portal to assist the USCG in meeting its reporting requirements

&#61607;	Utilize the SurveySolutions Application Programming Interface to create a flexible data repository for USCG

Description

The Library of Congress, Library Services (LS) has a requirement to create a blanket purchase order for the design of several LS products on a continuing basis.  The objective is to develop consistent design themes and standards, using the new Library of Congress logomark, and to create or update materials so that they have a consistent look for LS audiences, both external and internal.

Library Services is responsible for the “national library” functions of the Library of Congress.   The service unit maintains and manages the largest library in the world and is responsible for areas including acquisitions, cataloging, conservation and preservation research, preservation, access to collections, on-site reading rooms, services to blind and physically handicapped Americans, visitors services, publications, exhibitions and a variety of other public programs.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration is seeking a contractor for (ACTP): Analgesic Clinical Trials Data Transformation Pilot
REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ).  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.     

Requirements: 
Background: The mission of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) is to assure that safe and effective drugs are available to the American people.  CDER promotes, protects and enhances the health of the public through drug development, evaluation and continued safety monitoring throughout the drug life cycle.  To accomplish its mission CDER must contend with many important challenges. Failure rates in clinical development have remained largely unchanged over the past two decades.  FDA’s Critical Path Initiative (CPI) seeks to identify and address scientific and technical obstacles to optimize the development of safe and therapeutically important medical products.  Under the Critical Path Initiative (CPI), FDA is trying to identify innovative ways to enhance drug development and reduce the time it takes to bring therapeutically important and safer medical products to the market by leveraging prior knowledge.

To this day, the only analgesic drug products that are used widely and successfully are opioids,
acetaminophen and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), all of which have serious, potentially life-threatening toxicities even when used properly. While a number of products have been explorated early in the drug development process, there has been wide-spread reluctance on the part of the pharmaceutical industry to take novel products further into advanced development. This is in no small part due to the often daunting task of demonstrating the efficacy of analgesics in clinical trials. It is widely believed that the frequent failures of analgesic drug trials are due to numerous problems related to the design and analyses of these trials, including fixed-dose vs. titration-to-effect designs, choice of endpoints, high placebo response rates, frequent dropouts due to adverse events, and imputation strategies for missing data.  A systematic analysis of the legacy data of pooled trial data from multiple relevant analgesic trials for treatment of acute and chronic pain is critical to guide the design of future trials, improve success rates and pursue critical research questions. This knowledge base will provide a scientific foundation for pharmaceutical developers to build upon with regard to the study and development of novel analgesic products.

The FDA has accumulated the largest number of regulatory submissions of clinical trial data in the world. The Analgesic Clinical Trials Project (ACTP) seeks to analyze a large set of studies of several analgesics used to treat acute and chronic pain of varying etiologies.  The results of these analyses will help to understand why some studies are less successful than others, and will be used to improve analgesic trial design.  Currently, a systematic analysis of data from across various trials is difficult because the data from these studies have been submitted to the Agency in various non-standardized structures and formats. To facilitate meta-analysis across multiple studies, the legacy data that reside at FDA need to be transformed into a uniform standard structure that is compliant with the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC), Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM).  



IV. Objective: FDA wishes to engage independent expert consultants to provide technical assistance in developing methodologies for data transformation of legacy data into CDISC compliant SDTM datasets and metadata.

V.  Scope of Work: Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials and services necessary for performance of the work as described below.  

This contract could be used for one or more analytic studies, methodology development, testing and implementation support projects, and technical assistance. The contractor will assist in the development of a standard process for organizing, standardizing, analyzing, transforming, and validating the clinical trial data.  The contractor shall specify the methods it will employ in accomplishing the key tasks identified. The contractor shall demonstrate the ability to do the following:

1.	Supply the infrastructure, technology, and resources to build a secure repository of clinical data using the CDISC/SDTM model 

2.	Map and transform the raw data (from 2-3 studies) to the CDISC/SDTM model.  The technology will provide a visual design tool for building, implementing and managing data integration processes regardless of data sources, applications or platforms. 

3.	Provide validation and de-identification of the resulting SDTM data sets.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration is seeking a contractor for Automated Medical Device Safety Monitoring
REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ).  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.     

Requirements: 
Automated Medical Device Safety Monitoring

Post-market safety surveillance of medical devices is a complex task compounded by rapid dissemination of new medical technology, lack of standards in data collection, and inadequate passive adverse event reporting mechanisms. Researchers in Massachusetts have developed a computerized tool, that can monitor the adverse event rates of new medical devices through the continuous surveillance of clinical outcomes databases using a variety of statistical monitoring tools. 

The system has been tested and validated on a large clinical database at a single center within the domain of interventional cardiology and showed that the system was efficient in identifying very low frequency events. In addition these researchers have explored various alerting algorithms triggered by event trends.

It has been proposed to extend the system surveillance system to monitor a Massachusetts state-wide mandated outcomes data registry in interventional cardiology that is rigorously collected according to national standards. The system supports continuous monitoring utilizing dichotomous and continuous outcome analytic methods. The system MUST use Mass-DAC data and also has the ability to capture state-wide hospital and discharge information.

This automated safety monitoring system network may offer a valuable complementary approach to existing methods for medical device safety surveillance. This approach can be readily extended to monitor the safety of technologies outside of interventional cardiology as outcomes data repositories become available. 

Tasks: 
1. Use this network to prospectively monitor the safety of new cardiovascular devices recently approved, including use profiles and rates of diffusion.

2. To assess what outcomes are optimal for surveillance (in terms of sensitivity, specificity, etc.) by device type


  


 

It may be technically feasible to develop a modified version of the system for implementation at participating MedSun facilities that would have the following features:   
a) ability to locally or remotely configure prospective safety monitoring analyses as new devices are released or new concerns are raised 
b) ability to fully de-identify patient level information to forward to a central analysis in the system's server
c) ability for an alert at one center to trigger (via both e-mail and analytic configuration) the detailed automated review of similar cases (devices or patient subsets) at other centers with the system.  

5.  Reporting Requirements and Deliverable Items:  Quarterly reports which provide results of safety monitoring for recently approved cardiovascular devices and which outline what outcomes are optimal for surveillance by device type. 

6.  Duration of Base Project:  Period of performance is September 1, 2008 to August 31, 2009

This proposal addresses two fundamental challenges of continuous medical device safety monitoring.  The first is the necessary availability of a large scale, representative, high quality and granular outcomes registry.  The Mass-DAC dataset, like other audited, regulatory mandated outcomes registries, is of extremely high data quality, primarily due to the threat of loss of licensure in the state if a center is non-compliant with the strict regulations of data collection and audit.  The second challenge of the system network proposal is the timeliness of the information available for analysis.   Since the system’s clients will be integrated into the routine real-time clinical data acquisition at the sites, the system will have outcomes information as they become available to the participating centers.  The system will be "aware" of outcomes within 2-4 weeks of patient discharge.  Importantly, the system network is secured and HIPAA compliant and the Mass-DAC central processing center receives de-identified data from each client site (allowing for rapid aggregated analysis).

(End of Clause)   
The United Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), National Employee Development Center (NEDC) has a need for a Contractor to design and provide a course on plant herbivore interaction.  The Contactor must demonstrate expert knowledge of the specific circumstances and unique design needs of NRCS personnel as they work with private land users in the management of grazing lands.  

The course as designed and presented, through lectures and dialog, must explore functional relationships among soils, plants, herbivores, and people as they pertain to managing landscapes. Discussions must involve the behavioral principles and processes, explore avenues for research, and talk about implications for agricultural production involving feedlots, pastures, and rangelands; enhancing and maintaining biodiversity through grazing; ecosystem restoration involving grazing, invasive species, and riparian areas; enhancing wildlife values by mitigating human-wildlife conflicts; and conservation biology including re-introducing endangered species. 
Emphasis must be on the principles of plant and animal behavior to ensure that attendees can, upon completion of the course, translate the behavioral principles into practices that will provide an array of solutions to challenges people face in managing to improve the integrity of the land and to make a living from the land.  

The course instructor shall present a pre and a post test to the attendees to measure the effectiveness of the course.  The tests shall be given to the COR at the end of the course.  

Projected performance period for the initial course is June 17-26, 2008.  It is estimated that the course will have approximately 25-30 attendees. Students will be primarily those specializing in Grazing Land Management.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this course due to lack of enrollees.  If the Government cancels this course and no further courses are ordered during the ordering period of June 1, 2008 through May 31, 2011, the Government will pay a one-time amount of not more than $2,500 to the Contractor for the preparation required to present the courses.  

 The Contractor is responsible for the location of the training.  The Contractor shall provide all equipment and supplies necessary for presenting the course.  

Proposals: Contractors are asked to include the following information with their proposals.  

1) Summary of performance with federal agencies in the past 24 months, include contract number, purchase order number and agency phone number(s). If no past performance with federal agencies in past 24 months, include 3 professional business references.
2) Copy of proposed curriculum. 
3) Detailed quote on a per student basis for services rendered.  All quotes should be all inclusive and priced per attendee.  The awardee will only be paid for actual attendees.  (The Contactor shall figure the per head cost to include the cost of the training plus any overhead costs.)
4) Description of the location of training.  

The Instructor will be responsible for providing attendees with an electronic copy and a printed copy of English language course training materials.

Course completion reports shall be provided to the NECD COR (to be named upon award) not later than seven (7) days after course completion.

The Instructor shall be a professional, technically-qualified subject matter expert who possesses the necessary experience, knowledge and skills to perform the task outlined above.   The Instructor shall:

1.  Possess not less than ten years research and adult students teaching experience in the functional relationships among soils, plants, herbivores, and people as they pertain to managing of landscapes.

2. Demonstrate research and publication of scholarly articles in academic and professional journals including discussions on plant herbivore behavioral principles and processes and their implications for agricultural production involving feedlots, pastures, and rangelands; enhancing and maintaining biodiversity through grazing; ecosystem restoration involving grazing, invasive species, and riparian areas; enhancing wildlife values by mitigating human-wildlife conflicts; and conservation biology including re-introducing endangered species.

3. Presented information which demonstrates publication of not less than 12 scholarly papers and participation in academic conferences and professional organization meetings that emphasize principles of plant and animal behavior. 

4.  Demonstrate thorough understanding of Plant Herbivore Interaction principles and practices that focus attention on an array of solutions to challenges people face in managing, improving quality, integrity and living from the land. 

5. Demonstrate understanding of environmental factors and the infrastructure of a ranch such as corrals, fences, and water development.  

6. Demonstrate understanding of plant herbivore and interaction factors that scientists and managers often ignore the power of behavior to transform systems, despite compelling evidence.  

7. Demonstrate knowledge of the genome-environment interactions that begin during development in utero and early in life and continue throughout life. 

8.  Demonstrate understanding of the interaction of environments with the genome to create behaviors.  

9.  Demonstrate understanding of how the power of behavior to transform systems ecologically, “technology” packages transferring, economically, and socially, and fundamentally, change the way people understand and use animal behavior and plant interactions to manage ecosystems.  

10.  Demonstrate capacity to accomplish the requirements by providing evidential support for training a minimum of 25 adults and/or conducting Workshops in Plant Herbivore Interaction at not less then five locations within the United States and/or not less than five locations in Western developed democratic countries.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: technical capability of the firm or individual to meet the Government requirement, present/past performance and price.  Technical Capability of the firm or the individual combined with present/past performance is of a significant greater value than price. 

The evaluation of qualifying proposals will be carried out by the Contracting Officer and other personnel deemed necessary to complete the evaluation.

Technical Evaluation:  The evaluation of each proposal will assess and measure the ability and knowledge of the Offeror to provide the services described above.  In the evaluation of Technical Capability, the evaluator will use the following adjectives and related definitions to define the Technical Capability the proposal poses.
 
RATINGS	EVALUATION CRITERIA
Blue	Proposal meets all solicitation requirements, demonstrates an excellent understanding of the requirements, and possesses skills that offer significant advantages to the Government.  Excellent in all aspects.  Advantages/strengths are not offset by disadvantages/weaknesses.
Green	Proposal meets solicitation requirements and demonstrates an adequate understanding of the requirements but does not offer significant advantages to the Government over basic requirements.  Where there were areas of concern, clarifications given by the Offeror were acceptable.  Disadvantages/weaknesses are not significant.  
Yellow	Proposal meets some but not all of the solicitation requirements, but offers disadvantages (weaknesses) outweighing other advantages (strengths).
Pink	Proposal meets some but not all of the solicitation requirements. Proposal does not address all required criteria.  Proposal contains errors, omissions or deficiencies that may be able to be corrected without major rewrite or revision of proposal.
Red	Proposal demonstrates little or no understanding of the solicitation requirements; or approach fails to meet acceptable re-configuration expectations.  Proposal contains major errors, omissions or deficiencies and these conditions cannot be corrected without major rewrite or resubmission.  There is an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Government’s requirements.  

An Offeror’s Past/Present Performance will be evaluated at a factor level that most accurately defines the Offeror’s performance considering all potential evaluation criteria identified in the following section.  The evaluation will consider the Offeror’s past/present performance relating to the following factors: 

(1)	Customer Relationship
(2)	Prior Experience
(3)	Adherence to Delivery Schedule
(4)	Ability to Successfully Perform

The purpose of this notice is to inform all interested parties that the Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC intends to award a Firm Fixed Price type contract as a result of this solicitation.  The period of performance will be one year from the date of award. PROJECT TITLE: ?Acceptance Testing Services for 46.2mm Teflon Filters. 
Background
The  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina is responsible for procuring, testing, and distributing teflon filters of high purity to the State/local air pollution control agencies.  The teflon filters are used with a sampler to collect PM-2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 micrometers) samples.  This process assures filters with uniform characteristics and known quality assurance testing for the national particulate networks.
EPA obtains the filters each year from a filter manufacturer and has them shipped to EPA for acceptance testing.  The filters for a specific year must be made from the same lot of raw materials for distribution to the States.  If the acceptance testing confirms that the filters meet EPA's specifications for physical and chemical properties, the contractor shall ship the filters to the State/local air pollution control agencies.
Statement of Work
The following procedures, references and standards apply to the testing of filters during both the base period and option period.  The Government is under no obligation to exercise any part of the option requirement.  During both of these periods, the contractor shall test 525 filters from the batch of Teflon filters provided by the manufacturer, where a batch is defined as the filters to be used in one calendar year, specified by the PO for acceptance testing by the physical and chemical test described below.  All 525 filters shall be subjected to the visual inspection tests and then a certain quantity (specified in chart) shall be subjected to the other tests described below.  The contractor shall use a random number generator to select twenty-five (25) boxes of fifty (50) filters each from the total delivery.  The contractor shall then use a 
random number generator to select 525 filters (or more) for acceptance testing.  Only filters that pass the visual and physical testing shall be used for subsequent testing.   
A.	The contractor shall use the following test methods, which will be provided by the PO, to check the filters.!  American Society of Testing Methods (ASTM) Method D645-92 (standard test Method for Thickness of Paper and Paperboard)!  ASTM Method D828-93 (tensile Properties of Paper and Paperboard Using constant-Rate-of-Elongation Apparatus with Attachment for use on Hi-Vol Filters)!  Filter Flow Rate Acceptance Test Procedure!  Atmospheric Research and Exposure Assessment Laboratory (AREAL)  Visual Inspection Test for filters!  ASTM Method D2986-91 (Standard Practice for Evaluation of Air Assay Media by the
 Monodisperse DOP (Dioctyl Phthalate Smoke Test)
1.  Physical Properties: the list can be viewed at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.   
1.a.  Additional tests as required by 40CFR, Part 50, Appendix L, shall be performed on 50 filters.
(1)  Maximum moisture pickup:  Not more than 10 ?g weight increase after 24-hour exposure to air of 40 percent relative humidity, relative to weight after 24-hour exposure to air of 35 percent relative humidity.
(2)  Collection efficiency.  Greater than 99.7 percent, as measured by the DOP test (ASTM D 2986-91) with 0.3 ?m particles at the sampler's operating face velocity.
(3)  Filter weight stability.  Filter weight loss shall be less than 20 ?g, as measured in each of the following two tests specified in 6.9.1 and 6.9.2 of Appendix L.  The following conditions apply to both of these tests:  Filter weight loss shall be the average difference between the initial and the final filter weights of a random sample of 50 test filters.  The filters shall be weighed under laboratory conditions and shall have had no air sample passed through them (i.e., filter blanks).  Each test procedure must include initial conditioning and weighing, the test, and final conditioning and weighing.  Conditioning and weighing shall be in accordance with Part 50, Appendix L, and general guidance provided in the following reference:
REFERENCE
   Quality Assurance Handbook for Air Pollution Measurement Systems, Volume II, Ambient Air Specific Methods (Interim Edition), EPA/600/R 94/038b, Section 2.12.  Available from CERI, ORD Publications, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 26 West Martin Luther King Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45268.  (Note: Prior to publication and inclusion of Section 2.12 as part of this Handbook, prepublication draft copies of section 2.12 will be available from EMAD/MQAG (C339-02), U. S. EPA, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.)
(4)  Test for loose, surface particle contamination.  After the initial weighing, install each test filter, in turn, in a filter cassette (Figure numbers L-27, L-28, and L-29 from Appendix L) and drop the cassette from a height of 25 cm to a flat hard surface, such as a particle-free wood bench.  Repeat two times, for a total of three drop tests for each test filter.  Remove the test filter from the cassette and weigh the filter.  The average change in weight must be less than 20 ?g.
(5)  Test for temperature stability.  After weighing each filter, place the test filters in a drying oven set at 40 ?C ?2?C for not less than 48 hours.  Remove, condition, and reweigh each test filter.  The average change in weight must be less than 20 ?g.
(6)  Alkalinity.  Less than 25 microequivalents/gram of filter, as measured by the procedure given in the above reference.
1.b.  Trace Metal Analyses
The contractor shall analyze 50 filters for the trace elements listed below.  The acceptance criteria is that 90 percent (or 45 of the 50 filters) shall meet the following criteria.  The average concentrations for the total of the 30 trace metals in 90 percent of the filters shall be less than the stated concentrations (which is twice the minimum detectable concentrations).  The EPA shall reject the filters if any trace metal is ten times the minimum detectable concentration (or five times the concentrations stated below).
Maximum Concentration (ng/cm2) forTeflon Filters for XRF Analysis

2.  Visual Inspection for Acceptance
The maximum number of rejects allowed for all physical characteristics combined is 6 percent.  No defect is permitted for filter identification, and the maximum number allowed for the visual is 10 percent for defective filters and 5 percent for rejected filters.
The following descriptions of visual defects shall to be used in the acceptance inspection of the filters.  Each filter is inspected, using a light screen or table or by viewing over a black surface, for the following defects:
(a)  Pinhole - a small hole appearing (1) as a distinct and obvious bright point of light when examined over a light table or screen, or (2) as a dark spot when viewed over a black surface. Such a filter is considered a reject or unusable filter.
(b)  Separation of ring - any separation or lack of seal between the filter and reinforcing ring.  Such a filter is considered a reject filter.
(c)  Chaff or flashing - any extra attached residual material on the ring or heat seal area which would prevent obtaining an airtight seal when the ring is placed under compression.  Such a filter is considered a reject filter.
(d)  Loose material - any extra loose material or dirt particles on the filter which would require removal by brushing prior to weighing.  A filter with such a defect is considered a defective filter.  Defective filters are considered usable.
(e)  Discoloration - any obvious visible discoloration which might be evidence of a contaminant.  Such a filter is considered a reject filter.
(f)  Filter non-uniformity - any obvious visible non-uniformity in the appearance of the filter when viewed over a light table or black surface which might indicate graduation in porosity across the face of the filter.  A filter with such a defect is considered defective. (g)  Other - a filter with any imperfections not described above, such as irregular surfaces or other results of poor workmanship, may be considered defective.
B.  Distribution
The contractor shall distribute approximately 196,000 filters, provided by EPA, to the State/local air pollution control agencies as soon as the testing has been completed and the filters are determined to be acceptable to EPA.The Teflon filters will be shipped by the manufacturer in one lot packed in sets of 50 filters per container in suitable clear hard dust-tight non-contaminating plastic.  The contractor shall transfer the appropriate number of filter boxes from the manufacturer=s shipping cases to boxes provided by the contractor for distribution of the filters to the State/local air pollution control agencies nationwide.  The contractor shall never ship a partial box, and the smallest quantity of filters to be shipped to any location shall be one (set of 50 Teflon) box.  EPA will provide to the contractor shipping labels and a master letter (one-sided, 10 page document to the State/local agencies).  The contractor shall make copies of this letter
and include one copy in each shipment to the agencies.

After the filters are distributed, it is anticipated that 16 boxes of filters, measuring 16" x 20" x 14", will remain.  The contractor shall store the remaining filters until the PO notifies the Contractor in writing to either (a) send to State/local agencies whose filters were damaged in shipment, or (b) to dispose of them.
If a State/local agency receives the filters from the Contractor in a condition where contamination is suspected due to a shipping mishap and the Contractor is notified, the Contractor shall immediately notify the EPA PO to get written consent to ship another set of filters to the participant.
V.  Deliverables
A.  The contractor shall submit two copies of all test results to the PO within 75 days after receipt of the filters.B.  The contractor shall ship the filters to the designated State/local agencies within 5 days after notification by the PO. C.  The contractor shall store the remaining filters for up to 12 months.

L	EVALUATION FACTORS 
Award will be made to the responsible quoter submitting an overall quote that is determined most advantageous to the Government, price and non-price factors considered. Award will be made to the firm whose quote meets the Government’s requirements and whose technical performance and price represent the best value to the Government. The evaluation of quotes will be based on a technical evaluation of the Ability to Meet the SOW Requirements, Experience in Successful Delivery of the Required Classes and Past Performance non-price evaluation factors.  Ability to Meet the SOW Requirements and Experience are equally important to the Past Performance.  When combined, the technical evaluation factors of (1) Ability to Meet the SOW Requirements, (2) Experience and (3) Past Performance are significantly more important than price.  As the technical evaluation of quotes approaches equality, greater will be the importance of price in making the award determination.  In the event that two or more quotes are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent), award may be made to the lower priced quote.  It should be noted that award may be made to other than the lowest priced quote if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quotation, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted.  Awards may also be made on the basis of initial quotes without discussions.  Quoters are therefore cautioned that each initial quote should contain the quoter’s best terms. 

L-1	Ability to Meet the SOW Requirements 
The quoter must demonstrate the ability to meet the requirements as set forth in the SOW.  Provide evidence of Defense Acquisition University (DAU) course equivalency and evidence of American Council on Education (ACE) accreditation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC><p>Some questions that come to mind are;
<p>Will there be standing or flowing water present?, as I was informed there would be during my site visit. YES</p>
<p>In addition to side slopes, &amp; bottom it is also stated; all vegetation is to be removed from along the fence line &amp; shoulders. Only up to the fence the road is next to the ditches.</p>
<p>So are we talking about a requirement to manually clip/dig out vegetation that may be entangled in the chain link fence?, or will removal of any &amp; all vegetation accessible through mechanical means be acceptable?. For instance would it be acceptable to roto-till, or disk the fence line area if accessible with a small tractor should excavator reach prove to be limited? No only clean up to the perimeter fence. <br />. <br />Is there a cross section drawing available giving payline limits?. NONE</p>
<p>What is the actual total footage of the ditches to be cleaned? +or- 3575 FT.</p>
<p>Are elevation figures available to give an indication as to the percentage of fall between any structures, pipe crossing etc.?. NO</p>
<p>Please clarify: The paragraph 3.0 SCOPE, which seems to conflict with paragraph 5.0 GENERAL REQUIRMENTS. In regards as to whom is to grade out spoil piles at a later date. CES will grade out spoils.</p>

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS ISSUED UNDER AN RFP FORMAT.  THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO ISSUE A PERFORMANCE-BASED CONTRACT.  BELOW ARE THE EVALUATION FACTORS UPON WHICH EVALUATION WILL BE MADE:

EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD
 
4.1          Award.
 
4.1.1.      Contract award will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is compliant with the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, cost and non-cost factors considered.  The following evaluation factors and sub factors will form the basis for award.  The factors are listed in descending order of importance.  Factor A is significantly more important than Factors B and C.  Sub factors for Factor A are of equal Value.
 
Factor A: Past Performance      
                                                Factor B: Experience 
Sub factor 1: Technical Capability
Sub factor 2: Management Capability
Factor C: Cost
 
4.2          Evaluation Criteria
 
4.2.1.      Factor A: Past Performance: Past Performance is a measure of the degree to which an offeror has satisfied its customers in the past, and complied with Federal, State and Local laws and regulations.  Assessment of each offeror’s past performance will be subjective and based mainly on reputation with customers and others.  This evaluation is separate and distinct from the Contracting Officer’s responsibility determination.  The assessment of the offeror’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror to successfully meet requirements of the contract.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.
 
Evaluators will contact some or all of an offeror’s customers and others, including, but not limited to, Federal, state, and local government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases.  Contacts will be asked the following:
 
(1) Whether or not they believe that the offeror was capable, efficient, and effective;
 
(2) Whether the offeror’s performance conformed to the terms and conditions of the contract;
 
(3) Whether the offeror was reasonable and cooperative during performance;
 
(4) Whether the offeror was committed to customer satisfaction.
 
(5) Whether the offeror’s performance is devoid of wage and hour issues, complaints, and/or investigations.
 
Offerors lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably for pas performance.  However, an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous offer to the Government and thus may be an unsuccessful offeror when compared to other offerors.  Offerors will be required to submit Past Performance information as outlined below or an offeror must affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant, directly related, or similar past performance.
 

4.2.2                                       
                Factor B: Experience:  The following sub factors are of equal 
          importance and will be considered in the evaluation of the technical proposals.  Each offeror will be required to provide the information associated with the sub factor listed.
 
               Sub factor 1: Technical Capability: Offerors will be evaluated based on the following technical capabilities:
 
                Proven capabilities and experience in performing facility service work as described in the Section C-1, Scope of Work.
 
               Sub factor 2: Management Capability: Offerors will be evaluated based on the following management capabilities:
 
               Organizational structure for demonstrating contractual arrangement and lines of authority among key personnel. 
Specialized experience and professional qualifications of the key personnel in providing comprehensive services.
                
  
                
4.2.3.      Factor C: Price: The Government will use the total evaluated price method for evaluation purposes, including options.  Price may be the deciding factor for selection, depending upon whether a highly evaluated technical proposal warrants the evaluated cost differential.
 
All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  The degree of importance of cost increases with the degree of quality of the proposals or when the cost is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the technical superiority to the Government.  All others shall be evaluated against the established standards set forth herein.

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.           Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.           Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<DESC>This Notice is being issued to make the following changes to the Advisory Multi-Step Instructions.<BR><BR>1) Paragraph 3 (BOSS-R Scope) has been changed to read:<BR><BR>The scope of this acquisition has been defined in broad terms to support the expansive mission of the Biometrics requirement, but with sufficient detail to allow vendors to ascertain BTF Biometrics program requirements.  The Contractor shall provide the full range of biometrics services, technical and management expertise, and solution-related enabling products the functional categories to meet the mission needs of the BTF.  The Contractors shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, equipment, facilities, travel, and other services required to satisfy the ordered biometric capabilities and solutions.  While the requirement identifies three functional categories, the suite of resulting contracts is intended to satisfy the full range of biometric related requirements.  With the pace of change it is impossible to anticipate how biometric requirements and individual programs will evolve over the life of the contracts.  It is intended that the BOSS-R contract remains current and continues to provide the full range of biometrics capabilities/solutions and emerging technologies throughout its life.  The Contractor shall provide solutions for one or more of the following functional categories.<BR><BR>2) Paragraph 5.3 (Content Requirements) has been changed to read:<BR><BR>All submissions must include the information described in Sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.2.

FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514

TITLE:  Tangram:  A Fully Automated, Continuously Operating, Intelligence Analysis Support System 

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA # 06-04-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 should be submitted by 15 Dec 05; FY 07 by 1 Oct 06; FY 08 by 1 Oct 07 and, FY 09 by 1 Oct 08 and FY10 by 30 Sep 09.  White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 Sep 10, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section V of this announcement for further details. 

I.     FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

This BAA seeks research efforts that advance the state-of-the-art in the area of Intelligence and analytic support systems.   

The Intelligence Community and the Air Force routinely sponsor classified and unclassified research to advance the state of the art in intelligence and analytic support systems. To date, many of these programs have focused on developing systems, tools and algorithms to detect international terrorist activities and planned events of interest.  By relying on highly accurate and analyst-vetted knowledge about known terrorists, groups, affiliations, and activities these tools and methods have proven to be very effective at tracking terrorist suspects and detecting their threat event intentions.  In total, these programs have resulted in the development and evaluation of several methods of detecting and searching for patterns of terrorist behaviors, representing these behaviors in human and machine interpretable form and efficiently searching large data stores for evidence of known behaviors.  Significant effort has been invested in improving the performance and scalability of the most promising algorithms, often resulting in two orders of magnitude increase in scalability and four orders of magnitude speed-up in compute time.  However, the total production time for a single answer is currently measured in days and weeks.  To have any demonstrable improvement in the intelligence process we need to provide answers in hours or minutes.   Several fundamental challenges remain before the technology can be deployed broadly within the Intelligence Community.  The four key challenges that define the essence of the Tangram program are:

•	Reduce system and data configuration time of all automated entity and threat discovery processes by two orders of magnitude (100 x).
•	Reduce threat entity and event discovery time by two orders of magnitude (100 x).
•	Increase overall efficiency by three orders of magnitude and overall productivity by two orders of magnitude over current processes while delivering a consistently high intelligence value as determined by experienced analysts.
•	Improve the detection of low observable threats and events where guilt by association assumptions may not apply. 

The fundamental technologies developed under previous programs have been evaluated through peer review and technical evaluations. There is no debate that these technologies are capable of filling an important void in the Intelligence Community’s analytic arsenal. However, to achieve their potential, we must develop the processes, procedures and standards to deploy a fully automated, analytic system capable of processing tens of thousands of simultaneous analytic inquiries in an efficient and scalable manner. To achieve this, the data, algorithms, and computing resources must be flexible and adaptable.  Essentially, the system must be self composing because of the variety and unpredictability of the questions to be answered.

Tangram is unique in that it takes a systematic view of the process; applying what is now a set of disjointed technologies that are difficult for non-technical users to apply, cumbersome to configure into a self–configuring, continuously operating system.

Tangram is envisioned as a fully automated, continuously operating, intelligence analysis support system that’s capable of configuring itself to achieve a reasonable tradeoff between estimated intelligence value and cost, where:

•	Analysis Support means the production of hypotheses representing an adversary’s intentions, methods, logistics support or intended targets based on: 1) behavioral patterns, relationships or context that are expressed only in data and, 2) analyst feedback about prior hypotheses.

•	Configuring itself means the system is aware of the data characteristics, algorithm capabilities and requirements, and hardware resources such that it can reason how best to produce an answer.

•	Reasonable means good is enough, optimal is not required.

•	Intelligence Value is a subjective score or estimate of the intelligence utility of a hypotheses produced by the system.

•	Cost is the effort required to produce an answer and the opportunity cost of not producing a higher intelligence value product using the same system resources.

This BAA seeks research efforts that advance the state-of-the-art in the following areas: 1) System Research, 2) Component Research, and 3) Gap Filling Research, and 4) System Evaluation Architecture (SEA).  Additional details regarding these areas are detailed in the TANGRAM Proposer’s Information Packet (PIP) and other documents which can be found at https://extranet.if.afrl.af.mil/programs/TANGRAM/TANGRAM-extra.html.  Offerors wishing to propose in more than one area should submit separate white papers and proposals.

II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $49M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 06 - $8M; FY 07 - $12M; FY 08 - $12M; FY 09 - $12M; and FY10 - $5M.     

Offerors should make a genuine effort to estimate their actual costs for their research efforts and not attempt to use estimates of the number of awards and total program budget to guess at a realistic cost.  When evaluating cost realism and reasonableness the Government will take this into consideration.

For the System Research area, two awards are anticipated for a period not exceeding 48 months with go/no-go decisions at 24 months.  However, the Government may consider a single System Research award to an offeror. Any exceptionally strong system prototype proposal that demonstrates a solid understanding of the problem, proposes a technical approach with well managed risks, has an exceptionally proven team and the capabilities to transition their technology into classified  environments will be considered for a single award. Each award is not expected to be less than $3M per year.  For the Component Research, awards will not normally exceed 24 months with dollar amounts ranging from $250K to $2M per year.     For the System Evaluation Architecture (SEA), a single award not to exceed 48 months with dollar amounts ranging from $500K to $1.0M per year is anticipated.  For the Gap Filling Research, awards will not normally exceed 48 months with dollar amounts ranging from $150K to $750K per year.  The government plans to restrict the SEA award winner from also being awarded a System Research or Component Research award.  

Teaming:  AFRL anticipates awards to integrated team(s) to achieve the desired technical capabilities for the System Research technical area, the Component Research areas, and the System Evaluation Architecture (SEA) area.  Individual awards are anticipated for the Gap Filling Research areas. Teams may have any organizational structure capable of performing the work.  However, when a team is structured, a specific individual and institution with overall responsibility for team performance must be identified.

Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. 

The anticipated start date for the FY 06 efforts under the solicitation is May 2006.

The Project Management Plan should describe how the offeror plans to manage the team (i.e., primes/subcontractor relationships or multiple research groups within a single institution, as applicable).  Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. If the offeror wishes to restrict its white papers/proposals, they must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b). All white papers/proposals shall be single spaced with a font no smaller than 10 point.  In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to the technical POC, as discussed in paragraph five of this section.  
 
3.  SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 by 15 Dec 05; FY 07 by 1 Oct 06; FY 08 by 1 Oct 07; FY 09 by 1 Oct 08, and FY 10 by 30 Sep 09. White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 30 Sep 10, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  
     
4.  FUNDING RESTRICTIONS:  The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY, are regulated by the DoD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS). 

5.  OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  DO NOT send proposals or white papers to the Contracting Officer.  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Deborah Cerino, AFRL/RIED, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441.  Respondents are required to provide their Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number with their submittal and reference BAA-06-04-IFKA.

Electronic submission to BAA0604@rl.af.mil will also be accepted.     

VI. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:  (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - Including understanding the problem,  the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology, integration approach, and appropriate levels of readiness at yearly intervals, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3)  Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Cost Realism, Reasonableness, and Project Management Plan - The overall estimated costs should be clearly justified and appropriate for the technical complexity of the effort.  Evaluation will consider the value of the research to the government and the extent to which the proposed management plan details the capabilities necessary to effectively manage the team and allocate resources to achieve the capabilities proposed.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.     Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.     

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.       

VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.     Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white paper/proposals will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VIII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after whitepaper/proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:     

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

AFRL intends to team with one or more U.S. intelligence agencies, and may desire that proposers selected for award would perform in collaboration with those agencies.  Key Performers of prospective awardees whose activities would involve collaboration with the Intelligence Community must hold a current Top Secret Department of Defense (DoD) clearance and be approved for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access.  A sufficient number of non-key performers to enable the effective accomplishment of the proposed research effort must also hold a Top Secret DoD clearance with SCI access, or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access.

TITLE:  Network Attack Traceback
ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement 
FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 05-04-IFKA
CFDA Number:  12.800 
DATES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 05 should be submitted by 5 Apr 05; FY 06 by 1 Mar 06;  FY 07 by 1 Mar 07; and FY08 by 1 Feb 2008.  White papers will be accepted until 2 p.m. Eastern time on 1 Mar 09, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.         

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

DESCRIPTION:  Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)/IF, in conjunction with the Advanced Research and Development Activity (ARDA), is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to increase our knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required in support of  Network Attack Traceback, to include beta testing of prototype capabilities.  Solutions to basic and applied  research and engineering traceback problems using innovative approaches are sought.   This includes high-risk, high-payoff capabilities for non-cooperative and/or hostile network environments. The scope of this effort concerns the development of various tools and techniques that provide capabilities which will increase our knowledge of the true source of a network attack, ideally to the originating host, using solely technical means.  We are particularly interested in tracing attacks that would compromise the confidentiality and integrity of information on Intelligence Community (IC) networks.  These IC networks include the NIPRNET, SIPRNET, JWICS, and IC enclaves.  Techniques designed for tracing Denial-of-Service attacks in IC networks are NOT the focus of this BAA, nor are techniques that involve probabalistic packet marking. ARDA is especially interested in traceback techniques for attacks launched with single packets involving encrypted payloads, chaff and other obfuscation techniques. 
Research efforts under this program are expected to result in complete functional capabilities ideally addressing both the collection and analysis aspects of the traceback problem.  However, projects specializing in highly novel and interesting techniques for just collection or just analysis will also be considered, if deemed to be of “breakthrough” quality and importance.  The effectiveness of the developed technologies for potential operational use will be assessed through preplanned testing and evaluation activities.  Technologies that can be transitioned for operational use, particularly within the IC, are of high interest. 
Offerors are encouraged to describe the pre-conditions that are necessary for the proposed techniques to work efficiently. 
Offerors are encouraged to submit classified white papers via the appropriate channels.  Contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII.  
SCOPE:  The scope of this effort concerns the development of various tools and techniques to increase our knowledge of the true source of a network attack. The areas of interest include the broad range of tools and techniques to traceback the network attack to the originating Local Area Network, the attacker’s Internet Service Provider, or an originating Autonomous System with the goal of identifying the specific host which launched the attack. Deliverables will be technical reports, software, demonstrations, and  results of experiments which provide evidence and metrics concerning the assertions/claims about the research. Demonstrations may involve exploratory development models (ie brassboards) if appropriate.

II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $24.9M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 05 - $400K; FY 06 - $3.6M.  Additional funding of $17.9M each in FY07 and FY08 is also being pursued.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 18 months, and have a total value in the range of $400,000 to $1,000,000.  The total value of all efforts awarded under this BAA will not exceed $24.9 million.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts only.

The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  The program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Governments inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares and product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1.

<a href="mailto:norma.m.martinez@us.army.mil">ACA, White Sands Missile Range</a>
<DESC>Third set of questions and answers.<BR><BR>1.  I've completed a first draft of our TTE-1 Distributive Command and Control (C2) and Situational Awareness Portal white paper.<BR><BR>However, I'm not sure about the actual whitepaper required content/format.<BR><BR>The BAA clearly says only 15 pages.<BR><BR>But in the BAA page 26 there is a section called Content of White Papers that calls out a separate Microsoft Project File.  Also the page 26 discussions do not seem to match the White Paper Content Order or page counts given later.<BR><BR>I've attempted to do Content of White Papers 1 in the Technical Approach and Content of White Papers 2 in The Technology Overview.  Then a Gantt chart is required.  A quad chart, a separate MS Project File a WBS and a ROM--how do these count in the page count?<BR><BR>Then there is a section B. White Paper Content Order with conflicting instructions about the first ten pages or the first thirteen.  To be safe I've done 10 pages for sections 1-6 then separate pages for the Gantt schedule, WBS, quad chart and ROM. That's 14 pages not counting the cover.  I have a MS Project Gnatt File also to send with it but that's not a page.<BR><BR>Can you clarify this for me?<BR><BR>Response:<BR><BR>The 15 page limit is for the narrative. Any and all Appendixes required do not count towards the 15 page limit.<BR><BR>Please realize the attachments do not count.  Also, please disregard any conflicting guidance that calls for the first 10 pages.  Rather its the first 13 pages.....<BR><BR><BR>2.  Is there any specified number of phases and options suggested by the government? Is there any suggested duration of these phases and options?<BR><BR>Response: <BR><BR>Typically the White Paper should not go beyond three years.  In addition, the White Paper should provide for a phased approach indicating on-going progress towards deliverables.  As far as the options are concerned, it is up to the Offeror to determine when and where any options are needed.  It is up to the Government to determine if those options are to be exercised.  The duration (Period of Performance) on phases is set by the Offeror, but the Government will have periodic reviews to assess progress. <BR><BR>3.  Do the section headings in my white paper need to be exactly the same as the bold-face headings above and also in the exact same order, or it is alright so long all the contents described above are included in the paper?<BR><BR>Response: <BR><BR>Of course the major issue is content.  However, consistency does facilitate easier assessment.<BR><BR>4.  Are we to submit one white paper per subsection under each of the four major topics or one white paper per major topic?<BR><BR>Response: <BR><BR>The goal is to focus on a major topic area even if it may relate to other subsection areas.  This can be explained as shown in the TTA section on page 18 of the BAA for an example of S&T Needs in the third column.  The first example describes a proposal that is emphasizing the major topic area of Modeling and Architecture (MA) development although it also has relevance to other subsections.  These are indicated by the subsection references in the parentheses.  <BR><BR>5.  This concerns a statement on page 26, point 2, re delivery of software:<BR><BR>The Contractor shall specify whether...computer software is intended to be delivered with limited or restricted rights that would preclude it from being disseminated to other Contractors or foreign countries or integrated at system level.<BR><BR>As we will be proposing JACK and JACK Teams (our proprietary COTS<BR>software) as the basic framework for our approach, any future use and dissemination would involve s/w licensing (i.e. our software is not freeware).<BR><BR>Please advice if this licensing requirement would preclude the use of our technology in research associated with this BAA.<BR><BR>Or, for that matter, if a license requirement is considered as a 'negative' or 'minus' during assessment.<BR><BR>Response:<BR><BR>The use of limited or restricted rights is not considered as a 'negative' or 'minus' during assessment.<BR><BR><BR><BR>6.  Is the quad chart included in the 15 page limit?<BR><BR>Response: <BR><BR>The quad chart is Appendix E and consequently a separate page over and above the 15 page limit.  <BR><BR>7.  Is the WBS included in the 15 page limit?<BR><BR>Response:<BR><BR>The WBS is Appendix G and consequently a separate page over and above the 15 page limit<BR><BR>8.  On page 28 of the BAA, paragraph ii, the solicitation refers to the first 10 pages and then the first 13 pages. Which is correct? Should the WBS and quad chart be inserted in this section?<BR><BR>Response:<BR><BR>Ignore the 10 page instruction set.  Only the first thirteen pages apply.<BR><BR>9.  Where are the white paper submission instructions?<BR><BR>Response: <BR><BR>Page 27, Paragraph A. White Paper Instructions.<BR><BR>10.  The UAST BAA says, The deployment must include consideration for final transition to a partner that will take the technology to operational maturity (TRL 7-9, see Appendix J). <BR><BR>In order to line up potential transition partners it would be helpful to know what commitment (particularly financial) is expected of them in taking the technology to operational maturity. <BR><BR>Response:<BR><BR>The S&T program is designed to invest in scalable technology solutions that could have large ramifications and therefore would require commensurate investments assuming it was can be demonstrated and that the technology was both scalable and feasible.  It would be determined over the course of the S&T process what the follow-on investment strategy would be.  The investment dollars for FOC can be rather large depending on the overall value proposition.    <BR><BR><BR>11.  Page 25 -- Part II:  White Paper Preparation and Submission, Solicitation Process, Special Note: states:  Separate white papers are requested for each topic area for potential technology development that the Offeror is interested in submitting.  Even if the topic(s) is/are related, do not combine more than topic per white paper.<BR><BR>Page 12 defines four main categories: Models and Architecture; Aspects and Protocols; Testbeds and Test Environments; and Analytics& hereafter... referenced as the four Technical Topic Areas (TTAs).  <BR><BR>Is the special note on page 25 referring to these four Technical Topic Areas, and does Appendix K indicate that any (or all) of the items MA-1 through MA-7 would be included in a single white paper on the topic UAST Modeling and Architecture (MA) ?<BR><BR> 1.  UAST Modeling and Architecture (MA)     <BR><BR>MA-1 Sensors and Intelligence Fusion Processing<BR><BR>MA-2 Multi-Agent, Multi Sensor, MultiModal Decision Making<BR><BR>MA-3 Modeling, Simulation, and Prototyping for Complex Adaptive Environments  <BR><BR>MA-4 Energy and Sustainment<BR><BR>MA-5 Human Systems Integration and Human Machine Interface<BR><BR>MA-6 Adaptive Architectural Frameworks<BR><BR>MA-7 Collaborative Tools<BR><BR><BR>Response: <BR><BR>Page 18 of the BAA provides three examples of the types of projects we are looking for.  The intent was to limit the White Paper to one major topic area even though there might be a relationship to other areas.  The subtopics in the Appendix are there primarily to restrict the scope of the major topic areas. The Government wants to avoid the impression that an Offeror has to submit proposals for each subtopic area, but rather to focus on the major topic area and then describe relationships to the subtopic areas. The number of White Papers submitted is a decision the Offeror needs to make.<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>Section 1: Introduction

The Budget Formulation and Execution Line of Business (BFELoB) is chartered under the Budget Officers Advisory Council (BOAC) and managed by the Department of Education.  This is an interagency effort to improve the quality of budgeting in the Federal Departments and Agencies.  The BFELoB has initiated a number of activities to improve collaboration between members of the Federal budgeting community, improve the skills of budget professionals, document common business processes, improve the flow of budget data between Federal entities, and identify and improve the automated budgeting tools available to the Federal Departments and Agencies.

The BFELoB has created a working group consisting of knowledgeable staff from a number of Federal Departments and Agencies to develop a comparison of off the shelf budgeting software tools both in use by Federal Departments and Agencies and available in the private sector. 

This comparison is not part of any procurement activity.  It is intended solely to help Departments and Agencies judge their own needs and make plans for fulfilling those needs.  The comparison would be available only to the Federal budgeting community.  

The off the shelf software tools of interest to the BFELoB are those that provide widespread support to the complicated processes involved in Federal budget formulation and execution, to include activities such as strategic planning, payroll modeling, budget performance and integration, budget document production, and reporting.  The BFELoB is not including in its review software developed for a specific Department application (that could not be used in another Agency setting) or of general budgeting use that does not meet the specific needs of Federal budgeting organizations (spreadsheet applications, for example). 

The BFELoB had earlier surveyed Federal Departments and Agencies and is aware of what is in place within those organizations.  As described below, the work group is participating in demonstrations of those systems as part of this review.  The final data gathering step in our process is to gain an understanding of systems meeting our criteria that are available in the private sector, so that those systems can also be included in our review.

Section 2: Approach

The BFELoB work group, which consists of acting professional Federal budget and IT officers, was established last year.  Steps taken to date and planned in the near future are as follows:

2.1	Develop Generalized Functional Requirements 

To focus the review process, both on the part of the reviewers and organizations with budgeting tools being reviewed, the work group developed a generalized set of functional requirements containing elements needed by most Federal budgeting organizations.  This set of requirements was initially based on the functional requirements used by several Federal Agencies in earlier procurement activities.  This generalized set of functional requirements is available at:

https://max.omb.gov/maxportal/webData/lob/datahost/Revised_Decision_Matrix_Requirements_v2.0.xls

2.2	Develop Budgeting Scenarios

To guide people demonstrating the budgeting tools and to help the work group review the products, the work group has developed a set of scenarios depicting common business processes that are part of the Federal budget formulation and execution process.  These scenarios are being used by the working group during the demonstrations described below.  The functionality called for in the scenarios will for the basis of the comparisons. The scenarios are available at:

https://max.omb.gov/maxportal/webData/lob/datahost/Formulation_and_Execution_Scenarios_v._2.doc

2.3	View Demonstrations

The work group has begun viewing demonstrations of budgeting software in use in Federal Departments and Agencies.  During these demonstrations, work group members are determining whether the particular information system meets the functional needs contained in the scenarios. 

The next step for the work group is to view demonstrations of vendor products not yet in use in a Federal Department or Agency.  As stated above, the work group is interested in reviewing software products that meet the specific needs of Federal budgeting organizations, not just generalized budgeting tools.

2.4	Create Comparison Document

When the work group has witnessed all of the demonstrations, it will produce a matrix document listing each software product, and whether it addresses the required functionalities in each of the scenarios.  It is assumed that no software product will contain all of the functionalities contained in the scenarios. 

The comparison document will be made available to Federal budget officials for review.

Section 3: Requested Action

Vendors that have budgeting tools designed to meet some or all of the needs of Federal budgeting operations as spelled out in the functional requirements document and the related scenarios, but not yet in use in a Federal Department or Agency, are encouraged to volunteer to demonstrate their software to the working group. Vendors are also welcome to optionally indicate which of the specific functional requirements in the Decision Matrix Requirements their product addresses.  They may do so by sending an email within thirty days of the date of this RFI to: Budgetlob@ed.gov .  The email should describe the software proposed for demonstration including (but not limited to) such elements as:
·	A broad description of the functionality included in the product,
·	A brief description of the technical aspects of the product (platform, underlying software, scalability, etc.), and
·	A description of the product’s availability.
The email should also include the vendor’s contact information including name, phone number and email address.  The working group will contact vendors from whom we would like to receive a demonstration.

To reiterate, this comparison is not part of any procurement activity.  It is intended solely to assist Federal Government Departments and Agencies in assessing their current budget process capabilities and making plans to fulfill their needs.  Further, the inclusion of certain vendors in the comparison document should not be construed as an official endorsement by the U.S. Department of Education of any products or services offered.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to the original Presoliciation Notice posted on 29 April 2008 for the competitive procurement of the FY08 requirements for the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) of Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) craft is to revise the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) anticipated Request for Proposal (RFP) release date from 14 May 2008 to 23 May 2008.  As an administrative convenience, the entire Presolicitation Notice is provided below, with only the anticipated RFP release date changed; there are no other changes included herein.
The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) and Southwest Regional Maintenance Center (SWRMC) intend to competitively procure the FY08 requirements for the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) of Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) craft.  Two separate unrestricted Request for Proposals (RFPs), one issued by NAVSEA, the other issued by SWRMC, are planned for release in Spring 2008 leading to the award of two firm fixed price contracts.  This announcement only addresses the NAVSEA procurement.  A separate announcement will be released to address the SWRMC procurement.  NAVSEA intends to issue an unrestricted competitive RFP on or about May 23,2008 for the procurement of SLEPs for two Assault Craft Unit Four (ACU-4) crafts for FY08 with one FY08 option craft with the potential for one option year (FY09) for three additional craft SLEPs.  The LCAC SLEP scope of effort includes repair and upgrade of the buoyancy box (structural hull), gas turbine engine replacement, installation of an integrated Command, Control, Communication, Computer and Navigation (C4N) equipment package, and accomplishment of selected craft alterations and repair work.  The gas turbine engines will be furnished by the Government.  The SLEP effort is to be performed in accordance with Government prepared statements of work, specifications, drawings, work item descriptions, and craft alteration records.  Offers will be accepted nationwide.  Proposals will be accepted for either on-site work to be performed at ACU-4, Little Creek Naval Amphibious Base, Norfolk VA or off-site at Contractors facilities.  Offerors are not restricted to Master Ship Repair Agreement (MSRA) or Agreement for Boat Repair (ABR) holders.  Technical and price proposals will be required.  A SLEP FY08 website has been created to provide interested parties an overview of the SLEP program. Responses of interest in this announcement are to be provided via e-mail to Mr. Jeffrey Juger, NAVSEA Contracts, at the following address: jeffrey.juger@navy.mil.  The e-mail subject line must be titled "FY08 LCAC SLEP."  It is requested that responses be limited to one per company.  Responses shall include company name, primary point of contact with full contact information (i.e., mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address), and a list of individuals (including email addresses) requiring access to the SLEP FY08 website.  Each individual will receive information concerning website access.  Note that website access accounts established prior to 21 March 2008 are no longer valid and require reissue using the above process.  Accounts reissued or established from 21 March 2008 to date of release of this notice are still valid.  If you are interested in this planned procurement, it is advised that you monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Any updates and/or changes for this planned procurement, the posting of the RFP, and any future Amendments to the RFP, will appear at this FBO website.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of announcements and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case the FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.  Questions concerning this announcement shall be directed to Mr. Jeffrey Juger at telephone number (202) 781-2879 or by e-mail at jeffrey.juger@navy.mil (e-mail is preferred).

The design of the engineering and architectural features of the project shall be accomplished or reviewed and approved by engineers and architects registered to practice in their particular field within the District of Columbia.  The architect-engineer portion of this design-build entity must be a firm or joint venture having an existing active office located within the Washington, DC metropolitan area.  This existing active office will have the responsibility for providing the architectural and engineering services.

Offerors, individually or as a team, must have the capacity to obtain performance and payment bonding for up to 100% of the firm-fixed-price Design-Build Contract.

While the contractor's personnel will have to satisfy the requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12, the Government does not anticipate that any special security clearance (i.e., TOP SECRET) will be required to participate in this procurement.  

GSA intends to award a firm-fixed-price design-build contract pursuant to the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 36.3 and Subpart 15.  The procurement will be completed in two phases: Phase 1 will be a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and Phase 2 will be a Request for Proposals (RFP).  During Phase 1, Offerors will prepare and submit their qualifications as specified in the RFQ package which will be issued on or about March 17, 2008, on the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  

The evaluation factors for Phase 1 are as follows:  1) Past Performance, 2) Technical Approach, 3) Specialized Experience and Technical Competency, and 4) Capability to Perform.  Refer to the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) package for details on the Phase 1 evaluation criteria and information for submittals.  On or about early May 2008, the Government anticipates extending invitations to a maximum of five (5) of the most highly qualified offerors to submit Phase 2 proposals, which will be due on or about mid June 2008.  The short listed firms will be issued the Request for Proposal (RFP) package and may undergo a presentation and review process under separate evaluation factors.  Details on the evaluation factors and submittals will be outlined in the RFP.  The Government anticipates making an award in July 2008.  This solicitation is not set-aside for small businesses.  However, this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (F.A.R. 52-219-19).  Any qualified responsible firm, including small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small businesses, is encouraged to participate as prime contractors, or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses, or as subcontractors.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, to reflect this commitment.  Consequently, an Offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction), must demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.

The proposed site covers approximately 25 acres, bounded by Nebraska Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue, Rock Creek, and private property.   The scope of the project is to provide a three feeder spot network electrical system including utility metering switchgear, underground distribution, underground vaults and connections to the existing buildings. Critical programmatic requirements include the need to keep the existing buildings in operation until the new system is complete.  

The design-build scope of work includes all engineering, civil, architectural /structural, design, construction, and other related services necessary to design and to construct the electrical distribution system.  Related services include, but are not limited to, geotechnical evaluation and monitoring, archaeological monitoring, permitting, testing and inspection during construction, commissioning and potential additional geotechnical analysis of the site.  Preliminary approvals have been secured from National Capital Planning Commission for the current design. Additional submissions will be required to secure final approvals.

This project requires the construction of a new primary electrical system including underground utility metering vault, duct banks, underground network transformer vaults, connection to existing electrical systems and removal of the existing electrical system, including salvage of designated equipment at the Nebraska Avenue Complex, together with associated mechanical, electrical and general construction work. Work includes selective demolition of existing electrical system and storm water system, and provision of underground electrical substation vaults, electrical distribution system, spot network substations, including transformers and switchgear, medium voltage metering switchgear and cabling, PEPCO connections, switchboards, connections to existing electrical system, temporary wiring, excavation and backfill and surface restoration and incidental related work. The Contractor shall provide the services of Registered Professional Engineers and Architects, experienced in the type of work contemplated, to provide design, calculations, field survey, drawings and specifications covering the work. Disciplines anticipated include electrical engineering, structural engineering, civil engineering, architecture, and horticulture.

The Contractor shall provide all the necessary labor, materials, supervision, management, quality control plan and testing to produce a finished and operational electrical system conforming to the contract documents.

The completed project will meet or exceed all Federal design and construction statutes, standards, and regulations, including but not limited to the energy goals stated in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards, and Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection measures.  

Interested Offerors must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, which has successfully and satisfactorily completed projects of similar complexity, scope, and size; or, which has similar projects currently in construction.

The design of the engineering and architectural features of the project shall be accomplished or reviewed and approved by engineers and architects registered to practice in their particular field within the District of Columbia.  The architect-engineer portion of this design-build entity must be a firm or joint venture having an existing active office located within the Washington, DC metropolitan area.  This existing active office will have the responsibility for providing the architectural and engineering services.

Offerors, individually or as a team, must have the capacity to obtain performance and payment bonding for up to 100% of the firm-fixed-price Design-Build Contract.

While the contractor’s personnel will have to satisfy the requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12, the Government does not anticipate that any special security clearance (i.e., TOP SECRET) will be required to participate in this procurement.  

GSA intends to award a firm-fixed-price design-build contract pursuant to the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 36.3 and Subpart 15.  The procurement will be completed in two phases: Phase 1 will be a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and Phase 2 will be a Request for Proposals (RFP).  During Phase 1, Offerors will prepare and submit their qualifications as specified in the RFQ package which will be issued on or about March 17, 2008, on the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  

The evaluation factors for Phase 1 are as follows:  1) Past Performance, 2) Technical Approach, 3) Specialized Experience and Technical Competency, and 4) Capability to Perform.  Refer to the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) package for details on the Phase 1 evaluation criteria and information for submittals.  On or about early May 2008, the Government anticipates extending invitations to a maximum of five (5) of the most highly qualified offerors to submit Phase 2 proposals, which will be due on or about mid June 2008.  The short listed firms will be issued the Request for Proposal (RFP) package and may undergo a presentation and review process under separate evaluation factors.  Details on the evaluation factors and submittals will be outlined in the RFP.  The Government anticipates making an award in July 2008.  This solicitation is not set-aside for small businesses.  However, this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (F.A.R. 52-219-19).  Any qualified responsible firm, including small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small businesses, is encouraged to participate as prime contractors, or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses, or as subcontractors.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, to reflect this commitment.  Consequently, an Offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction), must demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  YOU ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF UPLOAD OF THE RFQ AT THIS SITE AND REGISTER ON THE INTERESTED VENDOR LIST (IVL).  In accordance with the requirements of the RFQ, Phase 1 proposals shall be submitted approximately April 25, 2008, by 1:00 PM, EST, to the following address: GSA, NCR, ROB, Bid Activity (WPP) - Room 1065, Seventh and D Streets, SW, Washington, DC 20407.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice for Scanning Electron Microscope System<BR><BR>The Government is interested in obtaining information regarding a Scanning Electron Microscope System used to study the chemical and physical properties of concrete and other materials on the microscopic level. Analysis of the needs for the system requires imaging of nanosized, uncoated conductive samples of various materials including building materials, soils, etc. The ERDC requires that uncoated samples such as concrete be imaged.  Furthermore, research into nano-sized materials requires precise navigation to allow repeatability and consistency in measurement.  In addition, the ERDC requires imaging of samples at both high and low accelerating voltages to be able to not damage samples as well as be able to obtain quantitative chemical analysis.<BR><BR>The Government is interested in any vendor that can furnish and deliver the system with the following specifications:<BR><BR>1.	Schottky Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) that combines high- and low-voltage ultra-high resolution capabilities. A low-voltage BSE detector must be included to obtain superior contrast and compositional information.  It must have an immersion lens mode combined with low-vacuum that will allow for unique, ultra-high resolution, characterization in an environment that suppresses charge build-up on non-conductors without limiting the overall size of the specimen. Clean and contrasted imaging is required when imaging in low vacuum for those samples that suffer from residual surface contamination.<BR><BR>2.	The system must be equipped with a complete oil-free vacuum system. In addition, the gun section must be pumped by a two-stage ion getter pump and separated from the specimen chamber by an isolation valve. Through-the-lens differential pumping must be included to enable the use of two specimen chamber vacuum modes: high vacuum and low vacuum. Specimen exchange must be able to be made in a few minutes. The system must be able to be switched between two vacuum modes enabling the investigation of conductive, non-conductive and high-vacuum incompatible materials: High vacuum (typically 10-5 mbar) for imaging and microanalysis of conductive and/or conventionally prepared specimens; Low vacuum (up to 200 Pa chamber pressure) for imaging and microanalysis of non-conductive specimens without preparation or coating;<BR><BR>3.	The FESEM must be equipped with a 5-axes motorized x-y-z-rotate-tilt stage, of which x, y, and rotation movements are piezo-controlled. Movements provided must be: x = y = 150 mm (motorized); z = 10 mm (motorized); Tilt +60 to 5 degrees (motorized); Minimum step size is 100 nm; Repeatability at 0 degrees tilt is 1 micrometer, and 2 micrometers at greater than 50 degrees tilt. Stage control software must include standard facilities for: Store and recall of sample position; Double-click feature select function; Multi-directional stage drive; Rotation<BR><BR>4.	The Electron optics system features must include: The Schottky FEG gun, a high stability ultra-high brightness FE electron source with high beam current capability; A two-mode final lens, allowing for immersion and field-free operation. The field-free mode ensures undistorted, very low magnification imaging. In immersion mode, the highest resolution is achieved; Beam deceleration, which can be activated for getting higher surface sensitivity and contrast using low and very low landing energies down to 50 eV, must be implemented as an additional degree of freedom to optimize contrast and surface sensitivity while improving the optical performance of the electron column. <BR><BR>Source:    FEG with ultra-high brightness Schottky field emitter<BR>Voltage:  High voltage 200 V to 30 kV, continuously adjustable<BR>Landing energy:  50 V to 30 kV, continuously adjustable<BR>Beam Current:  Up to 100 nA<BR>Resolution:  High-vacuum: 1.0 nm @ 15 kV, 1.6 nm @ 1 kV with secondary electrons (SE); Low-vacuum: 1.8 nm @ 3 kV, with optional SE detector<BR><BR>5.	The system must have high-resolution digital scanning engine controlled from the user interface:<BR><BR>Resolution: 512x442, 1024x884, 2048x1768, 3584x3094 pixels<BR>Minimum dwell time: 50 ns/pixel<BR>Electronic scan rotation by n x 360 degrees<BR><BR>6.	The system must have an in-lens SE and BSE detection for high-resolution imaging at both high and low kVs, as well as an Everhart-Thornley SE detector for conventional SE detection. The balanced field extraction system of this in- the-lens detector must allow continuous mixing of SE and BSE electrons. This in-lens system allows TV rate BSE imaging to an accelerating voltage of 1 kV. For imaging of non-conductive or contaminating samples, the system must be equipped with an SE detector that directly detects SE from gas amplification, as opposed to indirect means of photomultiplier detectors,  and enables imaging in low vacuum at low high-tension values, giving maximum surface information and minimal contamination. An integrated IR-CCD camera for in-chamber viewing must be included.<BR><BR>7.	Images must be displayed in an area of 1024 x 884 pixels, configurable for single frame display or 4-quadrant (live) display. Images must be able to be viewed live, averaged or integrated. Images must be able to be saved in TIFF, BMP or JPEG file formats, and in 8-bit or 16-bit depth, to the hard disk  on a support computer provided with the system or LAN  (via the Support Computer) from the graphical user interface. Image printing must be available from the user interface.<BR><BR>This Sources Sought is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ). This Sources Sought is not to be construed as a commitment by the U. S. Government. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this Sources Sought. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.

<DESC>1.  NOTICE:  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Pittsburgh District, is providing notice that it will extend the current term of contract number DACW59-03-D-0001.  This “bridge” extension is a short-term measure that will enable the agency to complete acquisition activities related to the competitively awarded follow-on contract to contract number DACW59-03-D-0001.  The contract provides service support for generator set activities in response to natural and man-made disasters, to include Incidents of National Significance, in the United States or its territories.  An Incident of National Significance is an actual or potential high-impact event that requires robust coordination of the Federal response.  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with other departments and agencies, and the White House, as appropriate, declares Incidents of National Significance.  There are no automatic triggers for an Incident of National Significance.  The contract will be extended for a period of five months.  The initial extension will be for a two month period and on a month to month basis thereafter until a replacement contract is awarded.  This is not a request for proposals.  Time does not permit the competitive solicitation, evaluation, and award of a bridge contract.

2.  CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS:  The current contractor is responsible for providing all labor, materials, transportation, equipment and supervision and required internal logistical support to perform generator set activities.  Generator set activities are defined as assessing power needs; preparing, hauling, installing, operating and maintaining, servicing, fueling, relocating and recovering diesel powered generator sets (Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and associated fuel systems; purchasing materials and installing miscellaneous electrical equipment in support of the response missions.  The Government furnished generator sets range in size from 4 KW up to 1MW.  The Contractor may also be required to lease generators to meet mission requirements.  The contractor will be required to perform generator set activities on leased generators, too.
