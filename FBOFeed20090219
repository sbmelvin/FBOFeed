<DESC>The intention of this solicitation is to select a Construction Management (CM) firm to serve as a CM at risk and provide professional management and construction services for the Garage, Spalled Concrete Project by means of a firm fixed-price contract. The CM at risk will be a member of the Project Team consisting of representatives of the Kennedy Center, the Architect/Engineer and other consultants.  In general, it will be the responsibility of the CM at risk to integrate the design and construction phases, utilizing their skill and knowledge of general contracting to develop schedules, prepare project construction estimates, study labor conditions, perform site investigations, and perform other similar tasks to contribute to the development of the project during the pre-construction/design phase. 

During the construction phase, the CM at risk will be responsible for construction of the project under the Guaranteed Maximum Price inclusive of all construction services therein. The CM at risk will utilize all labor, material, equipment, supervision, and transportation to modify

The JFKC garage exists on three levels below the footprint of the Kennedy Center building.  It has three levels, one of which is on grade and the other two are structured. The structure consists of a 10- inch thick cast in place, non-post tensioned slab, with small drop panels at the columns. The columns are steel with a substantial cast in place encasement with a mushroom cap, which supports the garage slabs. North and south additions to the garage are post-tensioned concrete. The new areas are not included in the repair program. The elevated garage slabs, which cover an area of about 375,000 sq. ft., exhibit a varying degree of deterioration on the underside. The top side of most slab areas was partially removed and recast under an earlier repair campaign using a micro silica concrete, and are topped with a traffic bearing membrane. During the repair work all normal garage operations and programs will continue, requiring maintenance of existing utilities, protection of adjacent properties and the traffic flow patterns.

Richter Cornbrooks Gribble Inc. have been contracted for the design services, including construction administration and will remain contracted directly to the Kennedy Center for the duration of the project.  

Proposals will be evaluated using the source selection procedures contained in the Request for Proposal (RFP), and award will be based upon the Best Value to the Government.  Technical factors are considered more importance than price. The Technical Factors to be addressed are: Firms Qualifications and Past Performance, Project Approach, Key Personnel Qualifications and Apprenticeship Program effort. 

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236220, Commercial Institutional Building Construction. The Size Standard is $28.5M. The estimated range for this project is between $1 Million and $2 Million.  The estimated time for completion is 22 months at 8 hours per day, Monday through Friday.  The estimated solicitation release date is March 5, 2009.  The estimated due date for proposals is April 2, 2009. The entire solicitation will be available for viewing and downloading at www.fbo.gov.

A pre-proposal site visit is anticipated, the schedule will be provided in the solicitation.    

In addition to standard mail service, questions may be forwarded via facsimile to Michelle D. Coleman, Contracting Officer, 202-416-7993, or e-mail mdcoleman@kennedy-center.org.

<a href="mailto:rsisneros@doeal.gov">Ray James Sisneros, Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>Notice of InterestDE-AR52-09NA29249February 18, 2009This Notice of Interest concerning the release of a Broad AgencyAnnouncement(BAA) to solicit research and development (R&D) regarding Nuclear ExplosionMonitoring Research and Development (NEM R&D) is issued in accordance with10CFR Part 600 and 48 CFR Part 35.016.  Offerors should not submit a proposalinresponse to this Notice of Interest, but may submit a proposal afterrelease ofthe solicitation.The United States Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and the DepartmentofEnergys National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) are strongadvocatesfor the small business community and interested small businesses, smallbusiness-lead teams, and joint ventures that qualify as small businessesareespecially encouraged to submit proposals under this BAA.Description:  AFRL and NNSA will jointly solicit proposals for R&D toimprovenational capabilities to detect, locate, and identify nuclear explosions.Itis anticipated that this planned solicitation will be released on or aboutMarch 18, 2009 and close on or about May 7, 2009 seeking proposals with aperiod of performance of 1-3 years with awards starting in fiscal year (FY)2010.  Research products developed under this planned solicitation shallsupport Air Force requirements for improving the nuclear explosionmonitoringcapabilities.The objective of this planned solicitation is to enhance U.S. capabilitiesinnuclear explosion monitoring primarily with ground-based systems. This willbeachieved through advances in the state-of-the-art for nuclear explosionmonitoring, basic and applied research that enhances understanding of theunderlying phenomena, developing new methods of tackling monitoringproblems,or developing new data for use in nuclear explosion monitoring.  Fieldexperiments may be proposed.Individual proposals should be directed to only one of the topic sub-areasdescribed below, but the Offeror may submit proposals in more than onetopicsub-area.  All topic sub-areas are of importance.  However, depending ontheproposals received and programmatic needs, funding may not be distributedevenly among the topic sub-areas.Research is being sought in the following topic areas:TOPIC 1: Radionuclide StudiesTOPIC 2: Regional Seismic StudiesTOPIC 3: Seismic PhenomenologyTOPIC 4: Seismic Methods in 3-DTOPIC 5: Infrasound StudiesTOPIC 6: Hydroacoustic StudiesTopic 1: Radionuclide Studies 1a. Xenon Measuring Instrument. Proposals are sought for the developmentofcompact instrumentation for the quantification of stable xenon as part of aradioactive xenon monitoring instrument with the objective of determiningthetotal amount of stable xenon in a mixed gaseous sample (xenon in nitrogen)fromindependent measures of pressure, temperature and mole fraction of xenon inorder to calculate the stable volume (standard ccs).  This measurement ischallenging due to the low pressures (1-100 torr) expected during thequantification, placing constraints on the binary gas analysis techniquetherefore it is expected that new gas sensing technologies will bedevelopedunder this project. The combined relative uncertainty (random and systematic) in the reportedvolume should be less than 1%. The technology should be robust, fielddeployable and not require regular calibration (6 months betweencalibrationchecks).  The anticipated quantity of xenon available for the measurementis0.25 cm3 (standard temperature and pressure).  The amount of nitrogen isanticipated to be in the range of 0.25  0.75 cm3 (STP).  A desired outcomefrom this work would be a compact instrument or technique usable for bothlaboratory and automated and unattended field measurements.1b. Elimination of Radioxenon Memory Effect. Proposals are sought for thedevelopment of detectors, materials and/or components that can be used forbeta-gamma coincident spectrometry gas cells, such as used in the AutomatedRadioxenon Sampler-Analyzer (ARSA), that exhibits very low or noappreciablememory effect for radioxenon samples in contact with the detector surfacesfor>24 hrs. A useful detection system will be rugged enough for field use, andbepossible to obtain in quantity.  The materials used in a beta-gamma gascellshould allow high detection efficiency at low energy (~30 keV) x-rays andbetasup to 1 MeV, and also allow for high resolution (<15% desired) detection ofconversion electrons in the range of 100-200 keV.1c. Portable Xenon Calibration Sources. Proposals are sought for portableequipment that can be used to produce low activity level, calibratedradioactive gaseous xenon calibration sources.  These sources should becompatible with commercial low level radioactive xenon detection systemsandtherefore concentrations in the range of 1-10 Bq per sample of radioactivexenon is the desired range.  This research must also address a technique toverify that the calibrated xenon sources are reproducible to significantlybetter than 10% accuracy. Successful proposals will address the productionofisotopes such as 133mXe and 135Xe, as well as the more common 133Xe.Production of these xenon isotopes singly and in combinations are desired,while minimizing the contamination of 133Xe and 131mXe in the samples.1d.  Xenon Sources and Background. Proposals are sought for the study ofsourceterms for Xe producing natural, medical, industrial, military and nuclearprocesses, the fate and transport of the Xe released and the regionalbackgrounds that might be encountered.Topic 2: Regional Seismic Studies2a. Velocity Models. Proposals are sought that develop advanced models oftheEarths velocity structure with predictive capability, especially inaseismicregions and in Eurasia. Of particular interest are: new techniques ofdetermining 3-D, spatially variable velocity models; techniques forbuildingmodels by fitting multiple datasets, especially of different types of data;techniques to estimate the uncertainty in geophysical models and assess thetradeoffs between different parameters of the models, as well as theuncertainty in predicted observables, such as travel times; studies thatcompare different methods to show their strengths and weaknesses; andmodelsthat can predict seismic amplitudes as well as travel times. Considerationshould be given to issues relating to integration of models intooperationaluse, such as supplying metadata, including the data used to derive and testthemodel, how the model is represented, resolution and reliability at theboundaryof the model. Priority will be given to studies of Eurasia. The influenceoflaterally-varying 2-D, 2.5-D, and 3-D structures, including 3-D scattering,onthe stability of propagation of Pn, Pg, Sn, and Lg phases and how thesephasespropagate to local (less than 200 km) and regional distances (less than2,000km) are of interest.2b. Attenuation Models. Proposals are sought to develop local and regionalattenuation models, with emphasis on their ability to match observedamplitudesof Pn, Pg, Sn, and Lg phases, their codas, and surface waves. Proposals todevelop new methods for measuring attenuation, to estimate uncertainty inattenuation models, and to develop models that fit multiple datasets (e.g.bodywave and surface wave amplitudes), are of interest.2c. Location and Discrimination Ground Truth. For seismic locationcalibration,collection of ground truth at a GT5 level (absolute location and deptherrorsless than 5 kilometers) or better, including dedicated explosions, issoughtfor events of magnitude 2.5 and larger. Research on new methods ofacquiringlocation ground truth will be accepted under this topic. Studies thatgeneratenew discrimination ground truth events, along with source geometry andothercharacterizing information, are sought. Waveform data, both the data usedtodefine ground truth and any other data generated by the event, are desired.Calibration of regional coda magnitude is of interest.Topic 3: Seismic Phenomenology3a. Seismic Energy Generation. Proposals are sought that complementexistingefforts to understand how seismic energy is generated from a range ofsources(explosions, earthquakes, mine collapses, and other modes of rock failure),andhow energy is partitioned between P, S, and surface waves. Experiments toimprove physical understanding of the generation and initial propagation ofthese wave types are of interest. Improved explosion source models, bothempirical and theoretical, which can predict observed P, S, and surfacewaveamplitudes over a wide range of frequencies are sought. New methods ofestimating the yield of fully coupled explosions, how emplacementconditionsaffect the observations, and the effect of multiple simultaneous andnear-simultaneous explosions, are of interest. Proposals for theoreticalandobservational investigations will be accepted under this topic.3b. Local and Regional Monitoring and Discrimination. Proposals are soughtthatwould produce new understanding of the properties of small seismic eventsandtheir seismic waveforms at local (200 km or less) and regional (2000 km orless) distances. Innovative methods of event detection that are appropriateforlocal events are of interest. Of particular interest are methods forestimatingyield, with low uncertainty, of seismic events recorded at local distances.Newmethods for discriminating explosions from earthquakes that have a firmphysical and statistical basis are of interest. Methods that candiscriminatedistributed from single-point explosions are also of interest.Topic 4: Seismic Methods in 3-DMethods appropriate for use in 3-D models, including the determination ofsuchmodels, are sought. Methods to calculate travel times that are accurate(within0.01 sec), rapid, and complete (all phases without ambiguity), or anycombination of these, are sought; however, accuracy should be at least 0.1sec.Proposals that examine such questions as what resolution is needed oroptimalto obtain a desired accuracy in path travel times or attenuation, and/orwhatthe accuracy that can be expected from a given model, will be consideredunderthis topic. Rapid and accurate methods to compute synthetic seismograms in3-Dmedia that offer significant advantages over current methods, particularlyathigh (> 1 Hz) frequencies are desired. Improved techniques for eventlocationin 3-D using models and/or ground truth are sought at local, regional ornear-teleseismic distances, particularly methods that use more than asingletype of data jointly. Robust estimation of uncertainty is of importance.Topic 5: Infrasound Studies5a. Seismo-Acoustics. Proposals are sought on the interpretation of signalsfrom co-located infrasound and seismic sensors at local and regionaldistances.Improved understanding of the fundamental physics of generation ofinfrasoundfrom underground and near-surface explosions and other sources is desired.Themaximum infrasound signal expected from events that do not have a surfacecomponent of energy release, such as shallow earthquakes, and the nature ofsuch a signal (impulsive or emergent) are of interest. Proposals thatexaminescaling of peak frequency and/or amplitude with (effective) source yield atlocal or regional distances are sought. Experimental, observational andtheoretical studies are of interest.5b. Propagation. Propagation of infrasound signals to local andnear-regionaldistances (less than 1,000 km) is of interest, particularly thephenomenologygoverning reception and characteristics of infrasound signals within theso-called zone of silence. Atmospheric conditions that affect detection,phaseassociation, yield estimation, and event identification are of particularinterest. Another topic of interest is the uncertainty in azimuth and rangedeterminations for infrasound signals from seismic events at local andregionaldistances.TOPIC 6: Hydroacoustic StudiesWe do not anticipate funding proposals for hydroacoustic studies, however,proposals which would significantly enhance nuclear explosion monitoringthrough hydroacoustics or which present a unique opportunity inhydroacousticstudies may be submitted for review.***********************END OF TOPICS********************************AFRL and NNSA reserve the right to determine which procurement instrumentshallbe used.  The procurement instrument shall be appropriate to the scope ofworkand procuring organization.  NNSA will predominantly issue contracts, butfinancial assistance awards may be used under certain circumstances.  TheAirForce will issue contracts only.  In the event a contract is issued,acquisition regulations apply per 48 CFR, and a cost reimbursement typecontract is anticipated.  In the event a financial assistance instrument isissued, 10 CFR 600 applies, a cooperative agreement is anticipated.The BAA will solicit proposals from all responsible organizations (foreignanddomestic) including industry, academic institutions, research institutions,andnon-profit organizations.  Federal agencies may submit proposals asprime/leadcontractors subject to appropriations language but may not partner withFederally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC).  FFRDCs,includingNNSA national laboratories, cannot directly respond to this solicitation asprime/lead participants.  FFRDCs, including NNSA national laboratories, mayparticipate in this solicitation as team members; however, suchparticipationmust be consistent with the FFRDCs sponsoring agreement.  The FFRDC effortforany proposal, in aggregate, shall not exceed 50% of the total effort of theproject.  Information will be provided in the solicitation on how toincludeFFRDCs, such as NNSA national laboratories, as a team member(s).Enhancing programmatic value is encouraged.  Low-cost proposals focused onvalidation or proof-of-principle issues will enhance programmatic value.Teaming is, also, an interesting way to add value, for example, teaming tofacilitate integration of research products into the Knowledge Base willenhance programmatic value.  Teaming which results in the training ofgraduatestudents (in particular university/industry teams working on real worldproblems with Ph.D. candidates) will enhance programmatic value.Programmaticvalue is anticipated to be one of the selection criteria for proposals.  Ifteaming arrangements are proposed, a clear statement of the intendedbenefit ofteaming must be provided along with the proposed technical approach,deliverables and costs clearly delineated for individual team members.  TheGovernment reserves the right to award to the team or to individual teammembers.All awards will have an NNSA Product Integrator (subject matter expert)assigned at the time of award to help ensure the successful transitioningofresearch products to operations, as appropriate.  Information about theNNSANuclear Explosion Monitoring Research and Development (NEM R&D) programintegration of research products into operational form for the Air Forcecan befound online at https://na22.nnsa.doe.gov/KnowledgeBase.The NNSA and AFRL each reserve the right to fund, in whole or in part, any,allor none of the proposals and to award without discussions.  This Notice ofInterest is being issued in advance of passage of FY 2010 appropriations toprovide more time for potential offerors to prepare and to allow awards tobemade as early as practicable within FY 2010.  The topics in this Notice ofInterest represent the maximum set of topics that may appear in thesolicitation.  The final number of topics and awards, however, are subjecttothe availability of funds.

<DESC>The Innovative Partnerships Program (IPP) provides technology for NASAs MissionDirectorates, Programs and Projects through investments and technology partnerships withindustry, academia, government agencies and national laboratories. As one of NASA'sMission Support Offices, IPP supports all four Mission Directorates and has programoffices at each of the ten NASA Centers. The IPP Partnership Seed Fund over the last fewyears has demonstrated success by enhancing NASA's ability to meet mission technologygoals by providing seed funding to address barriers and initiate cost-shared,joint-development partnerships. The IPP Seed Fund is used to provide "seed" funding toenable larger partnerships and development efforts to occur and will encourage, to themaximum extent possible, the leveraging of funding, resources and expertise from non-NASApartners, NASA Programs and Projects and NASA Centers.This Call to NASA Centers is soliciting proposals for cost-shared partnerships withindustry, academia, research institutions, national laboratories and other governmentagencies for joint development of technology that is of Mission interest to NASA. Awardsmade under this Call are contingent upon NASA budget appropriations and fundingavailability.  This solicitation is being distributed through the NASA Center IPP Offices(IPPO). In order to solicit external interest for partnerships through this Call, thisAnnouncement is posted to www.Fedbizops.gov and the http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/     website. Responses to this Announcement must involve partnerships with NASA and bereceived from NASA personnel participating as a Partnership Manager (PM) in the CenterIPP Office; with proposals including both an internal NASA Co-Principal Investigator(Co-PI) and an External Co-PI.	Proposals submitted directly from parties external toNASA will not be accepted.Proposed projects, due for submission by April 30, 2009, must include one or morenon-NASA partners in addition to non-IPP NASA partners who are committed to cost-share ata desired level at least equal to or greater than the IPP funding provided to theproject. For prior Seed Fund projects in the aggregate, additional internal NASAresources have typically matched IPP funds with external resources matching total NASAresources for a nearly 4:1 total leveraging for the project, relative to the IPP funding. Higher leveraging is desired and may enable more awards. Acceptable cost-sharing fromthe partner excludes any sunk costs and includes only actual dollars applied directly tothe project, in-kind considerations such as workforce labor and the use of unique anddedicated facilities and testbeds. Monetary valuation of partner in-kind facility and/ortestbed access should be based solely on actual costs incurred by the partner in theperformance of the proposed project, and should not reflect the partner'salready-incurred cost for developing the technology including the original capitalexpenditure for construction of the subject facilities and/or testbeds. For further information and questions regarding this announcement, including the fullPartnership Seed Fund Call for Proposals  2009, visit the IPP Seed Fund website(http://ipp.nasa.gov/ti_seed_fund.htm	  ) or kindly contact the IPP Points of Contactat any of the ten NASA Centers listed below.

<DESC>1.0	 Background

The National Childrens Study (NCS) is a major longitudinal cohort study that will follow children from before birth to at least 21 years of age and will evaluate the effects of a variety of environmental factors, including chemical, physical, biological, and psychosocial factors, on childrens health and well-being.  Researchers will analyze how these elements interact with each other and what helpful and/or harmful effects they might have on childrens health.  Data will be collected from children and their families from different areas of the country, from varied backgrounds, and of different family types.  

In order to study the main hypotheses for the National Childrens Study, a variety of data will be collected from participants, including biological specimens.  Biospecimens from a potential mother, father, and/or child will either be collected by a data collector or self-collected by the participant, and will take place at defined visits during the study. Study Centers from across the nation will manage the data collection within their area and will work with the Program Office (National Institute of Child Health and Disease (NICHD), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Centers for Disease Control (CDC)) and the Westat Coordinating Center to meet the needs of the study.  The study will begin with 7 Study Centers but will add on Study Centers over the first 11 years of the study to reach approximately 105 Study Centers.  

With a longitudinal study of this magnitude, it is essential that the quality of specimens and data be assured from the collection through testing for various analytes.  The purpose this SOW is to obtain laboratory services as part of the quality assurance and control plans for the NCS.  There are four major tasks to be supported: 1) characterization and storage of quality control (QC) pools; 2) measurement of analytes from a select number of biospecimens collected in early in the study from each Study Center; 3) conducting a methods study using Microfluidics, or lab on a chip; and, 4) analysis of biospecimens for pilot studies conducted to test stability of biospecimens under a variety of collection, processing, and storage conditions.  

2.0 Characterization of Quality Control Pools

QC specimen pools will be shipped from the NCS repository to the Contractor for characterization.  The analytes to be assayed and methodologies are summarized in Appendix 1.  For each analyte listed, the measurements must be made in duplicate in 20 sequential analytical runs to obtain maximum among- and within-run variation to calculate the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for precision and accuracy estimates for the quality control pools.   Forty laboratory measures will be performed on each analyte in a given matrix.  It is expected that all measurements will be completed within 30 working days of specimen receipt.

3.0 Operational Quality Control Testing

The Contractor will analyze specimens collected at seven NCS Study Centers during the pilot phase.  The first specimens will be submitted for laboratory analysis in June 2009 (see Appendix 2).  Specimens will be collected using NCS protocols and transferred to the NCS repository.  For the first 2 Study Center specimens, 308 specimens will be measured for each analyte measured in blood.  Urine specimens will be collected using a urine collection container from adults and diapers from infants resulting in a total number of 616 urine measures. Salivary cortisol measurements will be performed on collections of 6 specimens (3 specimens over 2 days per subject) resulting in a total number of 1778 assays.  Specimens will be shipped to the laboratory for analysis according to the time table outlined in Appendix 2.   Blind QC samples will be seeded into the study participant specimens as a method of internal quality assessment for the study operations.

Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters. The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance. The assessment of the quoter's past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ. The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most releva! nt to the RFQ.

<DESC>The Information Technology Acquisition Center (ITAC), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), plans to establish a DHS Information Technology (IT) department-wide contract for commodity products under the program name First Source. This procurement is being conducted by the ITAC in cooperation with the DHS Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the DHS Component IT and procurement communities. IT commodity products and solutions represents a significant portion of the DHSs IT budget and are currently provided through a disparate collection of acquisition methods, including Component-centric contracts, task orders against General Services Administration (GSA) schedules and Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs), and InterAgency Agreements. The establishment of a consolidated portfolio of multiple-award IT commodity contracts that are available for use throughout the Department is considered a primary ITAC objective. The First Source Program will support the DHS goal of a functionally integrated Department, promoting standardized equipment consistent with the Enterprise Architecture (EA) initiative among and between the various Components with the IT products and systems that enhance mission effectiveness and create economies of scale through the buying-power of the Department as a whole through consolidation of requirements. In support of its mission and strategic goals, DHS requires commercial IT commodity solutions for a wide variety of applications throughout the Department and its 22 Operating Components. DHS needs to access technological advances as they occur, and new business practices that may increase productivity, efficiency, and/or reduce costs while leveraging DHSs Department-wide buying power to obtain competitive prices. Therefore, the purpose of this contract is to provide DHS with access to a wide variety of commercial catalogs for IT commodity products from multiple Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), producers, and suppliers. The resulting contracts will include, but not be limited to: IT equipment and software, networking equipment, wireless technology, imaging products, voice recognition technology; on-line data reporting services for order, delivery, warranty, asset, and spend tracking; and associated product maintenance, installation, and support.  The First Source Program Objectives are to: 1. Maintain competitive prices for all offered IT commodity products by leveraging DHS buying-power by combining requirements on an enterprise-wide basis and through the contractor sponsored Dynamic Pricing Model; 2. Maintain continuous access to new IT technology consistent with the DHS Enterprise Architecture, as the technology is introduced to the commercial marketplace through the contractors commercial catalog; and 3. Meet DHS customer requirements for IT commodities, special delivery needs, and related services throughout the term of the contract. The First Source procurement is a Small Business set-aside using NAICS Code 541519; the business size standard is 150 employees. First Source is a complementary program to the EAGLE program.  EAGLE contractors will use First Source as a mandatory for use source for any equipment requirements in their task orders issued under EAGLE. The First Source procurement will result in multiple IDIQ contracts.  Contract term is a two-year base period with three one-year options. The Source Selection will be conducted using a best value analysis.  Evaluation factors for award will emphasize price, technical and management solutions, and past performance. The number of contract awards for all commodities will be sufficient to maintain adequate competition for specific delivery orders for products during the entire term of the contract. Offerors will be required to propose their published, commercial IT commodity catalogs for any or all of the required products. Prices for products included in the offerors catalogs will be based on the offerors proposed Dynamic Pricing Model (DPM). The DPM is the offerors proposed pricing mechanism which is devised to continuously assure that the most competitive prices for its offered products are available to DHS for the duration of the contract. First Source is not intended as a direct replacement of any legacy small or large business contracts. Rather, the high level equipment descriptions are intended to provide sufficient flexibility to meet a comprehensive range of potential agency requirements.  Specific requirements will be identified and defined at the delivery order level. First Source contracts will promote the use of performance-based contracting.  Specific equipment requirements will be defined in individual delivery orders that will be competed prior to their issuance.  Delivery orders will have their own delivery or performance period requirements.  IDIQ contract guaranteed minimums will be set at $250. DHS intends to conduct an Industry Day in which senior DHS procurement and IT officials will provide an overview of their strategies and perspectives on both Department-wide and Component initiatives. The date for the Industry Day will be announced via FedBizOpps. Seating will be limited, therefore registration is on a first come first served basis and only two representatives from each company will be allowed.  There is no registration fee associated with attending this event.  Telephone reservations and inquiries will not be accepted.  All vendors who respond to this announcement will receive an e-mail confirming their attendance for the Industry Day session. More information regarding the First Source Program can be found at www.dhs.gov/openforbusiness. It is anticipated that the First Source RFP will be released in early September 2005, via FedBizOpps, with contract awards in early CY2006. The draft First Source RFP is posted with this synopsis. Written comments received at dhsfirstsource@dhs.gov on or before August 26, 2005 will be considered for inclusion in the final First Source RFP.  Due to the anticipated level of interest, the Contracting Officer will not entertain requests for vendor visitations or marketing calls, or respond to telephonic inquiries.  Future information regarding First Source, including a complete list of Industry Day attendees, and vendor questions and DHS responses related to the First Source RFP, when posted, will be released to the public through the FedBizOpps  and the DHS.gov website. Any inquiries shall be made in writing via email to DHS at dhsfirstsource@dhs.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Description of Action:

The General Services Administration, Public Building Service, Region 7, Acquisition Services Division intends to award a stand alone, firm fixed price contract to Hodgetts and Fung Design and Architecture, Inc. for A/E consulting services during the design of the Donna Land Port of Entry project.

Therefore, only Hodgetts and Fung can provide the required services as they originally competed and won the 20% design concept contract.  The work will include design review and guidance through the design process to improve adherence to the GSA Design Excellence program.   In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), any responsible source may submit a capability statement detailing their ability to meet the requirement of being the author of the Donna Land Port of Entry 20% design concept and ability to provide the design consulting services.

<CONTACT>Lisandra Torres E-mail Only
<DESC>This Presolicitation Notice is being posted in advance of Solicitation No. M67854-09-R-3014 for the General Purpose (GP) Medium Shelter.  This commercial procurement is being issued as a total Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small business set-aside under authority of FAR Part 19.1305.  Any offer submitted to the resultant solicitation shall be in compliance with FAR 52.219-3 and 52.219-14.  This is a Presolicitation Notice only; no proposals are being requested at this time.  Information contained in this notice is subject to change.  The Marine Corps System Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense Systems, has a requirement for GP Medium Shelters with 512 to 650 square feet of floor space.  These shelters are to provide environmental protection for the United States Marine Corps field forces during the entire spectrum of military operations.  Shelters shall include the following requirements: they shall be mob! ile, durable, terrain-adaptable, all-weather, lightweight and have the ability to be quickly erected and struck and be suitable for use in the wide range of environmental conditions encountered during military operations.  The estimated total contract quantity (including all options) is a maximum of 3,400 shelters.  The NAICS code is 314912, Canvas and Related Product Mills, with a size standard of 500.  This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2. The Government will make Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract award(s) for initial minimum quantities of two (2) shelters each to no more than five (5) responsible HUBZone offeror(s) meeting or exceeding the technical acceptability standards for all non-cost factors at the lowest evaluated price.  After contract award, the Government anticipates exercising options for additional quantities above the contract minimum quanti! ties to no more than one (1) of the awardees based on the results of a Limited User Evaluation (LUE) of submitted shelters.  The basis for making the option exercise decision will be set forth in the solicitation. 
The Government anticipates evaluating shelters against the Salient Characteristics included in Section 2.0 of the Commercial Item Description (CID) which will be provided as an attachment to the solicitation, as well as commercial warranty provisions and monthly manufacturing capacity.  The Government also anticipates reviewing additional information provided to aid in making a responsibility determination.  Only those offerors determined to be acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award.  The Government will use test data to verify snow load, rain intrusion and wind load.  The Government will use test data and exterior fabric certifications (i.e. opacity) from the fabric manufacturers for detectability (including blackout capability and near infrared signature).  The Government will use certifications from the fabric manufacturers to verify flame resistance for the following component fabrics: exterior material, liner, plenum and!  floor.  Test methods will be identified in the forthcoming solicitation.  All test data/test reports and certifications required must be submitted with the offeror's proposal.  The test data/test reports and certifications the offeror submits as part of the written proposal shall clearly demonstrate the proposed shelter meets the requirements of the solicitation.  If the offeror proposes a modified shelter design/model different from that reflected in the test/data reports and certifications and/or an alternate test method/certification than the methods/certifications identified, the offeror shall clearly explain any and all differences between the two.  Such detailed explanation shall include why the submitted test data/certifications are technically relevant to the requirements and why additional testing on the proposed shelter is not required.  If the test data/certifications and/or the explanation/justification submitted fails to satisfactorily address or meet these cr! iteria, the Government may enter into discussions to resolve any inconsistencies.  Test data/test reports for testing conducted via commercial laboratories other than Aberdeen Test Center are acceptable as long as the offeror clearly documents the same testing procedures were followed.
Evaluation factors will be set forth in the forthcoming solicitation.  Solicitation No. M67854-09-R-3014 is anticipated to be issued within the next thirty (30) days and will be posted on the internet at the Federal Business Opportunities website located at the following address:     http://www.fedbizopps.gov, and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at http://www.neco.navy.mil.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award, Solicitation No. M67854-09-Q-4047The Marine Corp System Command intends to award a sole source contract to General Dynamics C4 Systems, Inc., 77 A Street., Needham, MA 02494-2806, for the following on February 25, 2009; TACLANE-GigE KG-175A  Encryptors.  Justification: Market surveys were conducted prior to the original purchase of equipment at the MCNOSC primary facility to determine which products were available on the market that would best meet the requirements of the Marine Corps.  The current requirement is for specific IT equipment to match what is in use at the primary site. Additional market survey efforts are not required or cost effective. Use of IT equipment other than what is currently in use at the MCNOSC primary facility would result in significant costs incurred from retraining personnel, additional engineering and redevelopment of current architecture and processes, as well as reduce the overall efficiency of failing over MESF to a duplicate site. Due to the processes involved in failing ov! er the required systems and the types of contingent events that will cause this reactive situation, it is imperative that all efforts be taken to reduce any possible corruption and potential for failure during this evolution. Like hardware platforms at both sites would significantly reduce the probability for technological failure as well as human error during the process of fail-over in an austere environment. These reasons would more than offset any savings achieved through the purchase of a new product. Therefore, it is not practical or reasonable to deviate from the requested hardware platform. This announcement is in accordance with FAR 5.101(a) (1). The point of Contact is Mr. Julian O. Boggan, Contract Specialist (703) 432-3512, E-mail: julian.boggan@usmc.mil.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. The Government does not intend to award a contract or any other type of agreement on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this synopsis. This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation for bid. The intent of this request for information is to conduct a market investigation to collect supporting data and documentation on which to base an appropriate acquisition strategy. Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this synopsis.
<p>The 685th Armament Support Squadron intends to openly compete the Weapons Planning Software (WPS) contract. This contract will develop components for Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) applications supporting precision guided munitions (PGM) mission planning requirements. The scope of this contract is expected to include continued development and sustainment of the following JMPS software components:</p>
<p>a. PGMPS: This JMPS Common Component (CC) provides mission planning support for Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Joint Stand Off Weapon (JSOW), Wind Corrected Munition (WCMD), Small Diameter Bomb I/II (SDB I/SDB II), AGM-130, and the United Kingdom Paveway 4 (PW4) munitions. Other weapons may be added as directed and funded by authorized organizations. For example, under the WPS contract, the Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) may be integrated into PGMPS.</p>
<p>b. JMPS Target Manager (JTM): JTM is a JMPS CC that manages target data to assist mission planners execute air strikes against the targets. This component integrates directly with PGMPS and provides interfaces such that other JMPS components may interface with JTM if desired. JTM evolved from the PGM Target Data Base (PGMTDB). Besides JTM, PGMTDB will be sustained in the UNIX environment on the USAF's Unix-Mission Planning System (MPS). PGMTDB will not be upgraded to the capabilities of JTM except for mandatory interface changes required to receive target data.</p>
<p>c. Universal Armament Interface Common Component (UAI CC): UAI CC integrates with PGMPS and aircraft Unique Planning Components (UPC) to facilitate passing of weapon target data sets to the weapon using the Mission Data Exchange Format (MiDEF) specified in MIL-STD-3014.</p>
<p>d. Key Handler Common Component (KHCC): The KHCC is now under initial development and will facilitate the passage of key data to allow mission planning of Network Enabled Weapons (NEW).</p>
<p>e. Weapon Data Link Initialization Common Component (WDLI CC): This CC provides the planner with network initialization data needed to allow NEW to operate in combat networks and is also under initial development.</p>
<p>All of the above mission planning components integrate with one or more of the other components. Additionally, all WPS contract components will integrate with fighter and bomber aircraft Mission Planning Environments (MPE) to provide a complete mission planning package for the various aircraft operational communities. WPS contract products will be used by F-15E, F-16, A-10, F-22, F-35, and B-1 operational units worldwide, including foreign nations flying those aircraft. During the expected WPS period of performance, WPS products are expected to be extended to B-2, B-52, and F-18 units as a minimum. Extensive integration efforts are required to support these aircraft MPEs.</p>
<p>Respondents to this RFI should provide documentation for Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level III. Respondents should document their experience in military mission planning software development in general and in JMPS software development in particular. This contract will develop new JMPS components and sustain existing JMPS products. The developer must be fully competent in JMPS development and provide a seamless transition at contract award with minimal schedule impact.</p>
<p>Respondents to this RFI should document their mission planning software development experience and capabilities dealing with the following mission planning areas of special interest to the Government: precision guided munitions, data link, data base tools, universal armament interface, crypto keys and key management.</p>
<p>The Government is anticipating a 10-year long term pricing agreement. If the RFI respondent does not accept these terms, please stipulate the length desired for contractual execution. Also provide your CAGE and DUNS codes.</p>
<p>The following sub-paragraphs are not to be addressed in your replies to this RFI. The Government intends to include evaluation factors similar in nature in the source selection. You should consider this information as you determine your ability and/or interest in submitting a proposal should the Government issue a Request for Proposal.</p>
<p>a. One of the first tasks assigned under the WPS contract is expected to be the integration of Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) mission planning requirements into PGMPS. The contractor's technical description of how to accomplish this task will be a critical Mission Capability evaluation factor. There is an existing MALD planning JMPS component but it is not integrated into PGMPS. A task for source selection evaluation will be to describe how you will meet all MALD mission planning requirements while fully integrating the MALD mission planning functionality into the PGMPS architecture and user interface design.</p>
<p>b. WPS contract products provide supporting mission planning capabilities for aircraft MPEs. It is imperative that WPS contract product development schedules be met. Otherwise, aircraft MPE schedules are adversely affected causing substantial financial impacts on those programs. Impacting dependent program schedules during the transition from the current contractor is the highest near term risk for the WPS contract. Bidders will be expected to address how they can transition from the current contractor and mitigate this program risk.</p>
<p>Clearly mark any proprietary information included in your submission.</p>
<p>Limit your RFI responses to five pages, each page shall be single spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch (10 point).</p>
<p>For questions, please contact: 685 ARSS, Attn. Jason Barnes, 207 West D Avenue, Suite 626, Eglin AFB, FL 32542; jason.barnes@eglin.af.mil; 850-882-0058. Responses to this Request for Information should be sent to Grisselle Nusimow, Contracting Officer, at Grisselle.Nusimow@eglin.af.mil. Please respond no later than 6 March 2009.</p>

<DESC>The Indian Health Service (IHS) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources for construction of the new Norton Sound Regional Hospital in Nome, Alaska. Please note that this is not a request for proposals and the Government is only seeking information for market research and acquisition planning purposes. 

This project will involve construction of an approximate 146,250 SF steel frame structure including 3 levels plus a mechanical penthouse.  The building will be located in Nome, Alaska on a 38.9 acre site. The replacement hospital will provide space and adequately support a modern, fully staffed health care delivery program including inpatient acute care and nursing and delivery (14 beds); endoscopy; outpatient surgery; ambulatory care; emergency and urgent care; ancillary for diagnostic imaging and laboratory; dental; optometry; audiology; respiratory and physical therapy; community health including public health nursing; nutrition; health education; alcoholism; environmental health; mental health and social services.

This project is presently being designed under a grant awarded by the Denali Commission to the Norton Sound Health Corporation (NSHC). The design by the firm of Kumin Associates, Inc. of Anchorage, Alaska in association with Mahlum Architects of Seattle, Washington is anticipated to be completed in February 2009.  NSHC will own and operate the new hospital which will be built on land owned by NSHC.  NSHC has also completed construction of the foundation gravel pad and the steel pile foundation will be complete by February 2009.

The current estimated construction cost range is $90 to $130 million.  Full funding for the construction project has not been appropriated but is anticipated to be made available in phases over 5 fiscal years beginning in Fiscal Year 2009.  The NAICS code for this effort is 236220 and the Small Business size standard is $33.5 million.   

General Contractors interested in this opportunity should submit a letter of interest that includes the following information to Abram Vinikoor at abram.vinikoor@ihs.gov by December 31, 2008. 

1. Provide the name of firm, a brief description of the firms history and capabilities and the contact information for the primary point of contact. 

2. Provide a brief narrative on three projects that you feel demonstrates your firms prior experience in providing general construction services of similar size, scope and location. 

3. Would your firm bid or propose on the project on its own or as a part of a joint venture?

4. Based upon the size standard, provide your business size and status: Large Business, Small Business, Indian or Native owned, Small Disadvantaged, Veteran Owned Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, 8(a) Contractor, or HubZone. 

5. What is the current and anticipated bonding capacity of your firm?

6. What issues should the Government consider in phasing and contracting the construction in the most efficient manner given the construction seasons and conditions in Nome? 

7. The early purchase of structural steel is being considered in 2009 so it could be provided as Government Furnished Materials for installation by the General Contractor in Spring 2010. Would this be advantageous? What assistance could you provide to the Government during steel detailing and fabrication to facilitate installation of the structural steel?  

8. Do you have any other recommendations on packaging the acquisition that would simplify the acquisition process or make participating in the project more likely for your firm?

<DESC><p>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE:  Management and support services to the research and development activities of the HIV Drug Resistance Program (HIV-DRP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR).</p>
<p><br />Notice Number:<br />SS-NCI-90001-MM</p>
<p>Issued By:<br />National Cancer Institute (NCI), <br />Office of Acquisitions (OA) <br />http://www.nci.nih.gov  or http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/</p>
<p>Key Dates:<br />Capability Statement Due Date:  March 5, 2009</p>
<p>General Information:</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified small business concerns including 8(a), HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned business concerns that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.</p>
<p>As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the NCI may issue a Request for Proposal (REP). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  However, should  such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The purpose of this contract is to:  (1) provide program augmentation and support for the HIV-DRP of the National Cancer Institute; (2) provide professional services, including studies and analysis; and (3) technical support for HIV-DRP activities or other new projects.  The HIV Drug Resistance Program (HIV-DRP) represents a focused basic science research effort that addresses this need and builds on the existing strength of HIV and retrovirus research within the Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NCI intramural research program has a long-standing tradition of strength in retroviruses, due to their importance to cancer research. This tradition has carried over into AIDS research, and there are currently more than 20 research groups within the NCI and contract laboratories who devote at least part of their effort to the study of HIV.  The studies currently underway range from basic research into how the virus interacts with its host cell to vaccine development and drug discovery.  The NCI houses one of the largest and most productive HIV and retrovirus research programs in the world. At present, there is no organizational mechanism to coordinate the efforts of the many groups within the program, despite their focus on many common problems.</p>
<p>Description of Information to be included in the Capability Statement:</p>
<p>Objective:<br />Specifically, the contractor/individual shall be expected to provide program development, building on past successes. The work to be performed covers a large variety of tasks, including:<br />1. Reviewing and making recommendations regarding design and interpretation of experiments covering the entire range of HIV studies (from basic to translational to clinical to prevention studies) performed by DRP personnel. Because some of the research done in HIV-DRP involves non-HIV retroviruses, a broad knowledge of retrovirology is essential.<br />2.  Review and provide written in depth analysis of scientific manuscripts prepared by Principal Investigators (PIs) in the program.  <br />3.  Meet with DRP PIs to discuss research results and ongoing experiments.  As an expert in the field, attend lectures/presentations by junior staff and provide critique to include suggestions for future scientific presentations.<br />4.  Review written patient protocols to determine feasibility of patients, drugs, conditions, budgets, how many beds needed, and timeframe of study.  Review analyses from different patients, drug reactions/interactions, on study continuance, changes, etc.<br />5.  Reviewing and making recommendations regarding the organization and staffing of the DRP and CCR AIDS research Programs.<br />6.  Provide services in the organization of scientific conferences relating to HIV and AIDS.<br />7. Researching and relaying the latest scientific and technological advances applicable to the HIV and AIDS research, and making recommendations regarding their application to the research goals of the DRP and CCR.<br />8. Reviewing and making recommendations regarding management of the DRP and COE (Center of Excellence) AIDS research budgets.<br />9.  Representing the DRP to the scientific community:  provide recommendations and guidance on developing the agenda for the annual DRP Symposium on Antiviral Drug Resistance, as well as the annual HIV Think Tank meeting; represent the HIV-DRP at scientific meetings devoted to HIV, AIDS, and antiviral drug resistance. Attend four scientific meetings during the contract period to keep abreast of scientific discoveries.  <br />10.  Participate in onsite meetings with CCR management as well as the HIV and Cancer Virology Center of Excellence leadership to provide recommendations concerning the overall research direction of the HIV-DRP and the associated cost impact on the fiscal year budget.  <br />11.  The contractor shall typically be at the NCI Frederick two days per week (Tuesdays and Wednesdays) during the contract period.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>These tasks can only be accomplished successfully by contractor personnel who have research training and experience necessary to perform the duties specified and meeting the following requirements:<br />1.  The contractor shall be involved in the area of HIV and AIDS research conducted in a laboratory setting, and experienced in management and strategic planning necessary to the operation of an internationally recognized HIV/AIDS research program. <br />2.  A broad, up-to-date, and sophisticated understanding of all aspects of research in HIV/AIDS and who have the deep understanding of research that comes from a long and successful career in research in many facets of HIV and retrovirus research with an expertise that extends from basic biochemistry and virology to patient-based studies and the interpretation of clinical data.<br />3.  To be able to provide relevant recommendations and guidance to the DRP and the CCR the contractor needs to have experience in the direction and management of large research programs, including recruitment of PIs and other personnel, development of their research programs and careers, analysis and development of operating budgets, development of research goals and creation and implementation of strategic plans to achieve these goals.<br />4.  Because the DRP sponsors different types of meetings the contractor needs experience in the organization of major international scientific meetings.<br />5.  To help judge the success of the individual research programs in the DRP, and the overall progress made by the program, the contractor needs experience in oversight and review of scientific programs in the NCI and elsewhere.<br />6.  Because the contactor will represent the DRP to the international AIDS research community, he/she needs sufficient international recognition and respect in the HIV/AIDS field to be able to communicate effectively with senior leaders within the NIH and elsewhere regarding collaboration, participation in scientific meetings, requests for advice, and the like.<br />7.  At least 20 years of postdoctoral experience and currently holding a senior position, equivalent to full Professor or Senior Scientist; extensive knowledge in the fields of retroviruses, HIV, and AIDS, as evidenced by more than 50 publications in these areas in peer-reviewed journals, as well awards and honors, and invitations to address national and international audiences. <br />8.

<DESC>SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/MARKET SURVEY Design and Construction Best Practices, Analysis and Recommendations for Dry Deck Shelter (DDS) to support a next-generation SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV).
DESCRIPTION:  This RFI is being conducted to determine if there is industry interest to produce or modify DDSs to support a next-generation SDV should the Government decide to procure such vehicles.  The decision to procure said DDS or a next-generation SDV has not yet been made, but this RFI would help inform programmatic questions inherent in that decision.  This RFI is for fact finding only and does not constitute a commitment or obligation by the Government to issue an RFP, contract or order.  The Government would not pay for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this announcement, nor would the Government return any data provided.  
A next-generation SDV should provide theater Special Operation Forces (SOF) commanders the operational capability to conduct insertion and extraction of SOF personnel and/or payloads into strategically planned operational areas.  The submersible would transit to the local operation area housed in a DDS mated to a host submarine.BACKGROUND: The existing six (6) DDSs are 9 feet wide, 9 feet high, 38 feet long, and displace approximately 35 tons.  They consist of three interconnected compartments made of HY-80 steel within a fiberglass fairing, each capable of independent internal pressurization to a depth of at least 130 feet.  When attached to its host submarine, the DDS can withstand external pressure to the submarine's full depth capability.  The DDS can be hosted by specifically modified LOS ANGELES, VIRGINIA, and OHIO (SSGN) Class submarines.  The forward-most compartment, a sphere, is the hyperbaric chamber which is used for treatment of injured divers.  In the middle compartment, or transfer trunk, operators enter and exit the submarine and/or either of the other compartments. The third compartment, the hangar, is a cylinder with elliptical ends which houses either the SDV or up to 20 SOF personnel with Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC).  For SDV missions, Mark 8 Mod 0 or Mod 1 SDVs are used.!   After flooding the hangar from sea and equalizing it with outside pressure, the DDS operators open the hangar's large outer door and wheel out the portable track onto the topside surface of the submarine. The cradle and SDV roll out on the track, and the SDV departs.  When the SDV returns, divers secure it to its cradle, winch it back into the DDS, wheel in the portable track and shut the hangar outer door.  The sea water in the hangar is then drained to the submarine.The next-generation SDV will provide increased range, payload, and transport a greater number of SOF personnel.  The capabilities of the next-generation SDV will be constrained by the space and payload weight carrying capacity of the DDS as well as the current method of launching and recovering the SDV.  Additionally, the extent of any increased dimensions or weight to the DDS may be constrained by various design factors of the DDS host submarines.  These factors include, but are not limited to, weight margin for host submarine stability, host submarine load-out within the existing equilibrium polygon,  structural constraints for mounting the DDS, and required piping and electrical interfaces between the DDS and host submarine.  An extended DDS is not intended to be installed on any LOS ANGELES Class Submarines.  The cost of modifying or building a new DDS to support the next-generation SDV, as well as cost of any required changes to the interfaces between the submarine and ! the DDS, will be a major factor in determining affordable capabilities of the next-generation SDV.
APPROACH:  In order to minimize technical risk and expeditiously deliver the capability to the fleet in a cost effective manner, an approach may leverage the design of the existing (6) DDS units for modification or upgrade.  Considerations should include means of adding hangar volume to house a larger SDV.  Changes to the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for launch and recovery of the next-generations SDV may allow for more efficient use of total DDS volume and length and alternate means of launching and recovering an SDV. The Government may provide limited access to a DDS for ship checks on a not to interfere basis and expects to provide the following items to potential responders as discussed below:a)	Drawings of the current DDS unitsb)	Specifications used to design and build the current DDS unitsc)	Current SDV launch and recovery proceduresd)	Topside arrangement drawings for VIRGINIA Class and OHIO Class SSGN host submarines

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: These unclassified system key performance parameter areas are applicable to the DDS which can support a next-generation SDV:a)	Largest dimensions of next-generation SDV which can be accommodatedb)	Number of SOF personnel which can concurrently with a housed next-generation SDVc)	Dimensions and weight of the DDS,d)	Launch and recovery CONOPS for the next-generation SDV and associated duratione)	Durability of the DDS while subjected to hydrodynamic and sea state conditions
DATA LIBRARY:  The Government will provide a classified electronic library (e.g. CDs) for responder accessibility to the GFI data/documents identified above for those responders cleared to receive the level of classified data.  In addition the documents will be made available at or near the Program Office in the Washington Navy Yard.  The Government does not warrant the content and performance of the design data contained therein.  Respondents may submit a request for classified information up to the Confidential level to: Naval Sea Systems Command Attn: Stephen Walsh, Code PMS399, 614 Sicard Street SE, Stop 8840, Washington Navy Yard DC 20376-8840, phone 202-781-2686, e-mail Stephen.T.Walsh@navy.mil.  Requests shall specifically include Respondents Name, Address and Zip Code, Cage Code and Cognizant Security Office (Name Address and Zip Code ) as well as the actual performance location including: Address and Zip Code, Cage Code and Cognizant Security Office, Address and Zip!  Code.  Classified documents will be forwarded only after Government review of the respondent's authorized security level.  Access to classified information shall only be for the duration of the RFI including Government evaluation of the RFI responses.
RESPONSES: Respondents must have the capability to handle classified material up to the level of CONFIDENTIAL.  Respondents should submit responses in hard copy and electronic format (.pdf, word, excel, project, powerpoint).  Responses must include the name, position, telephone number, and e-mail address of the Industry Point of Contact (POC) for technical and contractual issues.  Information is desired in the following areas:
a)	General sketches and description of a DDS concept (whether new, modified or modernized) which can support a larger and heavier next-generation SDVb)	New or developing technologies or proprietary products/processes associated with the responder's conceptc)	Contractor's assessment of the 10 highest risk areas and mitigation strategies.d)	Recommended changes to launch and recovery CONOPS that would facilitate advanced technologies or increased capabilitye)	ROM estimate of the scope of effort to refine the responder's concept to demonstrate feasibility with supporting calculation, mockup, analysis and or testsf)	ROM estimate of the cost to design, build, or modify DDS unit to provide six (6) DDS capable of  supporting a next-generation SDVg)	Description of required modifications to DDS host submarines or the submarine interfaces with the DDS, if any.h)	Estimated schedules and program timelinei)	Description of responder's facilities to conduct the work of the program or potential teaming arrangements

<DESC>This announcement is for market research and does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information (RFI), or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.  This RFI is issued for the purpose of gaining knowledge regarding the various types of environmentally friendly shuttle bus services available.
One shuttle bus would be required with seating capacity of 18-26 passengers plus 2 wheelchairs.  Buses must be accessible to individuals with disabilities.  A back-up bus must also be available in case the main bus cannot be used.
The current contract for Shuttle Buses on the Environmental Protection Agency campus at Research Triangle Park utilizes buses run on only on gasoline.  In keeping with the EPA?s mission, it is desired that the new contract utilize environmentally friendly vehicles.  Furthermore, the current contract leases and maintains the vehicles while a separate contract provides drivers of the vehicles.  It is the agency?s desire to combine these into one ?turn-key? contract. 
The agency is interested in receiving information regarding companies that can provide environmentally friendly shuttle bus vehicles along with the required maintenance and drivers for the vehicles.
Although a hybrid vehicle (i.e. gas-electric) is the agency?s preference, the term ?environmentally friendly? can include various factors including the use of alternative fuels or anything else that can be shown to have less of a carbon footprint than typical gas operated vehicles of the same size. 
A demonstration of bus capabilities on our campus at Research Triangle Park would be welcomed.  If a company wishes to set up such a demonstration please contact the contract specialist listed below.
The EPA requests that information on companies providing the above services be provided no later than March 5, 2009.  Please include description of vehicles, driving services and maintenance information along with information regarding vendor?s business status (e.g. large, small, small disadvantage, minority-owned, 8(a), SDVOB, etc.).

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, is conducting a sources sought notice to locate business concerns for providing software support as part of the development of a state-of-the-art, fully-integrated tool suite to assess and communicate aviation?s environmental effects.  The primary focus of the program is to develop a new capability to assess the interdependencies between aviation-related noise, emissions, and fuel burn, and to provide comprehensive impact and cost and benefit analyses to inform aviation environmental policy decisions.  The three main building blocks of the tool suite are: 
Environmental Design Space (EDS)  develops performance, noise, fuel burn, and emissions characteristics for aircraft.
Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT)  comprises the integration of both existing and original aviation noise and emissions analytical modules to provide an integrated capability to assess interrelationships between noise, emissions, and fuel burn across study scales from a single airport to world-wide 
Aviation environmental Portfolio Management Tool (APMT) ? applies economic, environmental response, and valuation modules based on information provided by AEDT and EDS to evaluate common, transparent cost/benefit methodologies for coordinated aviation and environmental policy development.
The main focus is the development of the APMT Partial Equilibrium Block (PEB), a component within the APMT.  Development of the PEB will greatly enhance APMT modeling and impact analysis capability.  Representative areas of the work are described below.
Continued PEB development, including developing codes, databases, and algorithms to enhance the tool and the overall tool suite;EB integration with APMT and other elements of the FAA / AEE tool suite;PEB assessment, as well as related system-level assessment;Domestic and international aviation analyses using the PEB and other related tools;Reducing and analyzing tool suite-related data, both domestic and international.

<DESC>Y -- SOURCES SOUGHT

The U. S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set-aside an acquisition for Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business or Small Business concerns only.  The estimated magnitude of this construction project is more than $25,000,000.00.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this acquisition is 236220 and the small business size standard is $33.5 Million.  The estimated time for completion is 540 days.  The solicitation, when issued, will be formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with the requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 for a competitive negotiated procurement utilizing the authorized Two-Phase Design-Build selection procedures of FAR 36.3.  The acquisition is for the design and construction of a Rescue Swimmer Training Facility (RSTF) to include a Modular Egress Training Simulator (METS) or Dunker at the U. S. Coast Guard Support Center, Elizabeth City, NC

The project scope includes the design and construction of approximately a 50,000 gross square feet (GSF) facility to directly support the ATTC command in the training of the Coast Guards Rescue Swimmer program.  The RSTF will consist of two training pools; (1) a 25m x 50m training pool and (2) a 30ft x 60ft dunker pool; each with a durable, low maintenance pool finish.  The 25m x 50m pool will promote a safe training environment for all Rescue Swimmer training scenarios; particularly when working with parachutes.  This pool will also have many technological features to simulate the real-world environment to include jumps towers, rotor wash simulation, fog generation, dusk and night simulation, and a wave generator.  The RSTF will also include a Modular Egress Training Simulator (METS) or Dunker pool.  The Modular Egress Training Simulator (METS) is an advanced underwater escape training simulator.  The METS demonstrates real-time immersion and inversion, and features exit-specific technology that replicates more than a dozen types of fixed-wing and rotary aircraft.  In addition to the construction of two pools, the RSTF will also include properly sized support spaces.  These support spaces include segregated locker rooms for students and instructors, a wet storage room for training gear/aids, a lecture classroom, an inflatables laboratory, an oxygen laboratory, and instructor office space.  At the present time, the acquisition is expected to be issued under full and open competition procedures.  However, in accordance with FAR 19.1305 and FAR 19.14, if your firm is HUBZone or a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by e-mail to Mrs. Donna Miller at donna.e.miller@uscg.mil or fax to (757) 852-3495.  In your response, include a positive statement of your intention to submit an offer for this solicitation as a prime contractor.  Your response is requested by December 1, 2008.  A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUBZone Small Business Set-aside, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Small Business concern or on an unrestricted basis will be posted on FEDBIZOPS at www.fbo.gov.

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<br />The 99th Medical Group located at Nellis AFB, Las Vegas, NV 89191 requires renewal of its maintenance support for its Script Pro 200 robotic Dispensing machine. The 99th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Script Pro USA, Inc. of Mission KS. 66202. Interested parties may e-mail stephen.colton@nellis.af.mil or fax 702-652-5405, Attn: Stephen Colton, not later than Wednesday, 25 February 2009; 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time.<br />Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:<br />22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within six days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>Script Pro's drug dispensing equipment is the equipment currently in place at Nellis AFB's main hospital. To acquire maintenance and support services from another company, other than script pro would void the current warranty and forfeit the Govt.'s right to future software upgrades and updates. To purchase any other brand of equipment, at this point, would cost the Govt. approximately $180,000. This figure greatly exceeds the current Independent Govt. estimate. In summary, to procure maintenance and support services from any company, other than Script Pro would result in substantial duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through full and open competition.</p>

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity proposes to solicit and award on a brand name only basis for an EMC Storage Area Network (SAN). The reason for brand name only request is that the EMC brand is for a replacement system for our current EMC SAN, an upgrade to our current system.

Partition of network drives i.e. J: Drive, S: Drive would not require extensive reconfiguration.  Providing seamless transition to WRAIR researchers. Competing this requirement and awarding to any other source would result in substantial delays and disruption of a sustem already in place and would also increase the overall cost to the Government.  Solicitation No. W81XWH-09-T-0110 will be issued on or about 06 March 2009 and proposals will be due on or about 16 March 2009 @ 1:30 PM EST.  This procurement shall be under other than full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source (brand) and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334112 with a size standard of 1000 employees.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be issued by this contracting office.  All interested parties can view, download and print a copy of the solicitation and any resulting amendments on or about 07 March 2009 at the following website:  www.usamraa.army.mil, click on Solicitations, then click View Additional Solicitation on the ASFI website.  In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, all contractors wishing to do business with the Department of Defense must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

Boston Healthcare System. This software package facilitates the integration of real-time Intra-Cardiac Echocardiography, ICE, images acquired during interventional electrophysiology procedures, providing concurrent side by side analysis of patients anatomy without undue or repeated manipulation of cardiac needles, wires, sheaths or catheters potentially causing deleterious events and minimizing medical staff and the patient to excessive ionizing radiation. The CartoSound System is compatible with the Siemens Cypress AcuNav ICE Echo machine already on station which as well has previously been acquired by V.A. Boston Healthcare System. The Medically ordered utilization of the Carto XP System upgraded with CartoSound is authorized by the Medical Director of the Electrophysiology Laboratory. The authorization of medical technology of advanced application provides a community standard of care to VISN 1 patients in that performance of procedures will be more safely executed and not to use an imaging system of such great capacity could result in injurious procedures, protracted procedures exposing patients and laboratory staff to excessive ionizing radiation and extended therapeutic procedures expose patients to infectious processes. Biosense-Webster, Inc. is the sole source vendor for this sophisticated software upgrade and they maintain proprietary solicitation rites to their distribution. Not to upgrade the existing system and utilize this technological imaging enhancement could compromise patient care and extend and magnify hospitalizations for therapeutic management of Congestive Heart Failure, CHF.

Any questions received after the specified date and time above will not be responded to. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated award date is on or around March 20, 2009. Basis For Award: The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter(s) whose quotation is responsive to the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach.  Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoters quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important that the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical and management quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoterss technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor. These factors are listed in their relative order of importance: Factor I - Technical Capabilities: a. Contract Requirements; Quotations will be evaluated on the quoters ability to provide all of the contract requirements relating to lodging, meeting space, food and beverage, and secured storage requirements.  Quotations must address the quoters ability to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as it relates to lodging and meeting space.  Quotations should reflect quality of services provided and maintained; b. Location Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoters to provide a facility located within the specified postal zip codes with adequate parking for participants and presenters; c. Availability of dates Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested. Additional consideration will be given to those quoters who can provide the services on the dates in the order indicated; Site Visits: The EEOC reserves the right to conduct a site visit of all quoters who are rated to be technically acceptable.  The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities portion of the technical evaluation factors; Factor 2  Past Performance The quoter must provide references for at least three (3) federal government contracts for the same or similar services.  Contracts should have been awarded within the past three (3) years.  Contact information for each reference shall include the following: Contract type, Contract number, Contract value, Point of contact phone number, Type of services provided, List any problems encountered on each contract and the contractors corrective actions. EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of timely deliveries and customer service on similar requirements; NOTE: In the event that a quoter has no Past Performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase quoters overall rating nor decrease it. Factor 3  The Government will evaluate price in comparison to the independent Government cost estimate. Notice: The Government reserves the right to make contract award without discussions with quoters (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, quoters must submit their most favorable terms from a technical standpoint.  In addition to the above, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commerical Items applies to this acquisition. The vendor shall include a complete copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items with your quote. Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions---Commercial Items; Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders---Commercial Items; Clause 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Person; Clause 52.222-3, Convict Labor; Clause 52.222-19, Child Labor-Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies; Clause 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities; Clause 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; Clause 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities; Clause 52.225-13, Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases; Clause 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration, are incorporated by reference.

<CONTACT>Jason J Day, Phone 618-229-9285, Fax 618-229-9177, Email jason.day@disa.mil
<DESC><p><br />DISA/DITCO, intends to issue a sole source contract to Aperture Technologies, Inc, 9 Riverbend Drive South, P.O. Box 4906, Stanford, CT 06907. This acquisition is for maintenance of Aperture TRVISTA software covering 81,000 square feet. The software being maintained is proprietary and protected by copyright laws. No third party maintenance is authorized. Period of performance is 01 Mar 2009 through 31 Aug 2009. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304( c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Companies who can provide the above listed software maintenance renewal must complete the solicitation, HC1028-09-T-2069 available at http://www.fbo.gov/. The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price purchase order. This is a small business set aside. The NAICS code is 541513 for this procurement. The justification detailing the government's essential need for Aperture Software Maintenance is listed below.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following paragraphs, IAW FAR Part 13.501, are provided to support the brand name justification for proposed orders exceeding the micro-purchase threshold, but not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>This requirement is for the renewal of software maintenance of Aperture's product Vista 500C for 81,000 sq. ft. of DISA raised floor area. Vista 500C is an Aperture database, which contains floor plan drawings for each processing center. The drawings identify equipment locations, equipment environmental requirements, total floor space, inventory and other pertinent information. In turn, this provides authorized users access to Aperture data via secure web interface, and to operate with the secure ESM operating environment. The period of performance is 03/01/09 through 08/20/09.</p>
<p>Aperture Technologies Inc is the only company in the United States that can provide support for this proprietary COTS software and is currently providing licenses/ maintenance under existing software maintenance contracts in DISA. Aperture Technologies Inc owns all proprietary rights to the source code.</p>
<p>Obtaining replacement software products from other sources would result in extensive software conversions resulting in additional costs for the Military Services and Agencies and central design activities, which have developed in house applications using these COTS software products in their application systems. Therefore, a competitive acquisition for this renewal is not feasible, and it is determined that DISA will use Aperture products.</p>

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;
 (g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is included.

  Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) Warrants;
(ii) Options;
(iii) Contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) Convertible debt instruments;
(v) Others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

"ENCLOSURE:  Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, 
Notice for Filing Agency Protests, is included with this solicitation.
 
Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. 
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
     Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Ombudsman Program
The Coast Guard Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests is a program intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns informally within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum. It is designed to resolve contractor protests in a faster, less expensive manner than could be accomplished at an external forum. Concerns of interested parties can be resolved through independent, government binding adjudication taking place outside the procuring activity's chain of command.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement contains the written solicitation, and quotes are being requested. The 319th Contracting Squadron at Grand Forks AFB, ND intends to purchase the Professional DynaMetric Programs Platinum Plan&reg; behavioral assessment tool. This purchase is Brand Name approved. PDP's Platinum Plan includes 5,000 surveys, web access to the company's database, job models, and team reports. Contractor shall maintain company web site for a period up to a maximum of one year after date of award. The contractor shall also be responsible for the training and certification for 10 individuals at Grand Forks AFB, ND and provide 10 Facilitator's Guides.<br />The Contractor shall also provide 200 PDPWorks&reg; Application Workbooks:<br />75 ea Developing Effective Communiciation Skills.<br />63 ea Strengthening Leadership Peformance.<br />62 ea Developing High Performance Teams.<br />Quote should also contain transportation and per diem costs.
<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR BRAND NAME PURCHASE:<br />The PDPWorks&reg; assessment tool is the only software suite that meets the agency's need. The 319th ARW purchased 500 PDP&reg; Platinum surveys at the end of FY08. These surveys cost the 319th ARW $7,988.00. Over 450 man hours in the past four months were spent training on the PDP for both individuals and organizations system equating to $3,789.40. The 319th ARW/HC Chapel Tithing and Offering Funds has purchased nearly $10,000 in PDP surveys and other products. An additional 240 hours were spent on this portion of the program. If an assessment system other than PDPWorks&reg; were to be purchased, this would result in substantial duplication of cost and man hours to the Government that is not expected to be recovered.</p>

The equals must be the same fit and function as the Sun Micro model and are subject to review before approval.  It is the responsibility of the vendor to obtain Sun Micro's specs based on the part # given and to match these specs.

<DESC>As a result of the RFI, numerous questions were received.  At this time, the government has chosen to answer the two below.  The other responses to the other questions received will be taken into account if a request for proposals is issued.

1.  Does DDC have a preference for the basis to be used in developing ROM pricing such as number of users, number of handheld devices etc? 

ANSWER: Yes.... Number of devices.  Devices are expected to be shared between users and between shifts. We expect each user to have his/her own headset, but share handheld terminals, at the end of shift with another employee. 

2.  Does the below segment from page 7 of the RFI, imply that the preferred solution must enable DLA personnel to voice-enable their applications?

Applications Program Development.	Any script/macro/program generation/development software and applications software will be required as part of the prototype to allow dedicated DLA applications programmer and IT technicians to continue to develop applications that utilize this technology.

ANSWER: Yes. We see this project if approved to have the initial application professionally developed. Follow on applications will be developed by the dedicated DLA programming staff. Tools and training have to be available to add additional functionality.

<DESC>The following are vendor questions and the Government's responses:1.	QUESTION:  Section B.3, Statement of Work, the following is stated: "The Department of Veterans Affairs southeastern regional group of 8 hospitals (VISN 6) has multiple opening for various clinical positions such as physicians, nurses, therapists, etc.  Many of these positions are difficult to fill, have been vacant for an extended period of time and are a priority for filling in the VISN." In Section B.2, Schedule of Items/Prices, the following is stated: "Contractor shall perform a Talent Search Services for the physicians noted on Task Orders issued on an as needed basis." Is the Talent Search for physicians only, or for a variety of clinical positions?  If the Talent Search is for physicians only (see question 1), are you seeking a flat fee regardless of specialty area (General Practitioner vs Surgeon?) ANSWER:  The Talent Search is primarily for Physicians, but we can request other clinical positions be filled, as needed.  Yes, we are seeking a flat fee regardless of specialty area.2.

<DESC>A. General Information:

In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), this request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the announcement. This is a Sources Sought regarding potential sources. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires Professional Services to provide consultation, advisory and project management services to Whole-genome sequence analysis of Salmonella enterica serovars commonly associated with foodborne outbreaks from processed foods, fresh-cut produce, and poultry.
 

The intent of this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement is to conduct market research to identify sources to support informed decisions to procure for the required services, i.e., a total small business set-aside action  (e.g., SBA Certified 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned, HUBZone, Small Disadvantaged, Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned,), GSA task order, etc. Our intention is to specifically identify small businesses. This notice is a Request for Information (SOURCES SOUGHT) for all interested qualified small businesses that meet the requirements for this effort.
The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541380 with a small business size standard of $12 million. This is not an invitation for bid, request for quote or other solicitation. 

B. Statement of Work Base Contract:
The contractor shall:

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, furnish the necessary personnel, services, and otherwise do all things necessary for, or incident to, the performance of the work. 

The contractor shall provide staff (contract staff) to be trained and capable of performing the tasks as described in this contract providing quality of work.  

Ensuring the American public that their food supply is safe to the consumer is a paramount mission of the US Food and Drug Administration. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, in conjunction with ORA, has the responsibility to provide the technology and methods for the analysis of foods. The emphasis of this contract is to focus on obtaining data that will reflect a broader scope of the frequency and levels of bacteriological human pathogens that have historically been associated with fresh produce commodities and a variety of ready-to-eat (RTE) foods.  Since the United States government has been advocating that the American public consume more fresh produce so Americans can lead longer and healthier lives, it is incumbent on all the players in this field, from the grower, processor, transporter, and grocer to the government agencies that provide an oversight on food production, to ensure that foods are safe to consume. This should apply to produce commodities grown and processed domestically and to imported foods as well, since the United States imports much of its food supply. All commodities that enter this country should also be devoid of any biological or chemical agent that can be deleterious to health.  Since the late 1990s, there have been an average of 16 foodborne outbreaks annually attributed to fresh produce. In many cases, the source of the outbreak is unknown; however, some, such as the recent Salmonella outbreak associated with jalapeno peppers, made national and international news. Although the Food and Drug Administration in 1998 (final guidance in 2007) issued its Guide to Minimize Microbial Food Safety Hazards for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables (Good Agricultural Practices and Good Manufacturing Practices), the Agency has had to respond to several major produce-related outbreaks over the past few years.  The potential risks, from either zoonotic or human sources, to contamination with either a viral, protozoan or bacterial human pathogen can be traced to specific commodities, locations (domestic and imports), water sources and perhaps equipment used in processing and collection. For instance, examples of contaminated commodities include leafy greens (EHEC, Salmonella), tomatoes (Salmonella), green onions (HAV, Shigella), cantaloupe (Salmonella), parsley, cilantro, culantro (Salmonella, Shigella). 

In order to better understand how pervasive microbial pathogens are in fresh produce commodities the objective of this contract is to analyze selected foods for the presence of Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli O157:H7.  As for RTE foods, our focus will be on Listeria monocytogenes. Our plans include the generation of a database for these select produce as to the frequency of isolation/detection of the aforementioned pathogens in each commodity as it relates to its geographical location and growing season. 

The impact of such data collection could have an affect on any Produce Safety Regulatory Options Developed by FDA with the following parameters: Consistent across the U.S., based on sound science, overarching (most commonly consumed fresh produce), accommodate specifics (commodity, region, operations, practices, size of establishment), and allow the U.S. to meet its obligations under WTO SPS.

All data collected as part of this contract will be evaluated for potential posting at www.FoodRisk.org is an online information resource providing data, tools, and resources for risk analysis professionals.  The site is hosted by the Joint Institute for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (JIFSAN) which is a partnership between FDA and the University of Maryland.  FoodRisk.org has agreed to host the formatted data and make it available through the website.  Having the data of this study from surveying environmental and food samples in regard to the presence of Listeria monocytogenes  in RTEs, purchased from supermarkets data accessible through JIFSAN will help FDA and others refine existing food safety risk assessment models, build improved models, and develop appropriate consumer education and outreach campaigns.  FDA supports the need to reformat the data and make it widely available through the internet.
C. Project Background:

The US Food and Drug Administration and The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutritions (CFSAN) mission is to promote and protect the publics health by ensuring that the nations food supply is safe, wholesome, sanitary, and labeled in earnest. Ensuring the American public that their food supply is safe to consumers is a paramount mission of the US Food and Drug Administration. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, in conjunction with ORA, has the responsibility to develop, apply, and provide the necessary technology and methods for the effective screening, detection, and identification of foodborne pathogens from foods. This analysis often requires the application of facile molecular genetic methods in order to allow for a rapid and highly accurate genetic trace back of a foodborne pathogen to a particular food source, pathogen cluster, or locale. Such techniques often rely heavily on the genetic information provided from the genome-wide sequence analysis of these strains.  That is, the use of fully sequenced genome information often provides the starting point for identifying and applying unique genetic signatures in the form of SNPs (single nucleotide substitutions) for the differentiation and clustering of closely related pathogenic strains.  To this end, massive collaborative efforts are now in place between several genomic institutes which provide rapid throughput whole genome sequencing and federal and state public health laboratories which exploit the nascent sequence data to develop rapid subtyping methodologies based on SNP detection technology. As examples, several of these technologies include the Luminex SNP detection platform (Bio-Rad), Pyrosequencing (Corbett), and the IBIS T-5000 EIS-TOF SNP detection (IBIS) platforms. 

In recent times, numerous Salmonella serovars have been associated with a number of foodborne outbreaks in the U.S. Many of these outbreaks have come from Salmonella strains isolated from tomatoes, sprouts, cantaloupes, and derivative juices. Foodborne illness from Salmonella Newport, for example, has been associated with consumption of tomatoes cultivated on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.  In 2002 (512 cases), 2005 (71 cases), and 2006 (107 cases), S. Newport was found to have sickened consumers who ingested raw tomatoes from several Eastern shore farms.  The epidemiological complexity of Salmonella-induced outbreaks is manifold and includes: (i) potentially numerous natural reservoirs of Salmonella in the ecosystem, (ii) a lack of suspect isolates actually found on tomato, and (iii) a widely-dispersed area of affected individuals to name but a few aggravating circumstances. Salmonella, in general, appears to be a prominent and rising pathogen associated with produce and increased foodborne illness. In addition, Salmonella poses a substantial health risk since numerous strains appear to be resistant to at least one antibiotic with many strains displaying multi-drug resistant phenotypes. Salmonella has been shown to persist in certain niches for long periods of time.  For example, recent reports have demonstrated long-term survival of S. Newport in the gut of free-living nematodes.  Other studies have shown these serovars to be effective colonizers of living plant tissues that would help to account for the persistence of Salmonella on tomatoes and tomato plants. The ecological complexities of this recurrent contamination of tomato by Salmonella mandate the development of more effective and more sensitive DNA sequence-based subtyping methodologies.  These methods are important for more rapid and effective responses to these Salmonella-induced foodborne outbreaks as they should provide important information about the origins of an outbreak including the produce commodity, the geographic locales, and the genetic/epidemiological lineage of the Salmonella involved. 
This project is intended to provide CFSAN with a detailed nucleotide-sequence based survey of the complete genomic structure of a significant number of those current and specific Salmonella pathogens associated with produce-borne outbreaks of salmonellosis among the American public. Outbreaks due to the contamination of produce have received a heightened interest from the American public, public health agencies, and regulatory bodies. 

The first task order that will be issued will provide significant data on the specific DNA sequence-based genetic structures of several of the most common Salmonella strains to associated with human illness caused by the consumption of fresh produce. These data will facilitate the design of specific diagnostic tests for effective detection, identification, and differentiation of foodborne outbreak strains of Salmonella.  That is, the full-length genomic data harvested from this project will allow for the identification of effective nucleic-acid based targets for uniquely and unambiguously identifying a specific strain or serovar of Salmonella.  All data generated, including all of the raw nucleotide sequence files generated will be sent to the project officer and encompass a comprehensive genomic database of Salmonella pathogens within CFSAN that are commonly associated with foodborne outbreaks originating from fresh-cut produce and undercooked poultry and eggs.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled FY2009 IPP SEED FUND CALLANNOUNCEMENT which was posted on February 19, 2009.  The Innovative Partnerships Program (IPP) provides technology for NASAs MissionDirectorates, Programs and Projects through investments and technology partnerships withindustry, academia, government agencies and national laboratories. As one of NASA'sMission Support Offices, IPP supports all four Mission Directorates and has programoffices at each of the ten NASA Centers. The IPP Partnership Seed Fund over the last fewyears has demonstrated success by enhancing NASA's ability to meet mission technologygoals by providing seed funding to address barriers and initiate cost-shared,joint-development partnerships. The IPP Seed Fund is used to provide "seed" funding toenable larger partnerships and development efforts to occur and will encourage, to themaximum extent possible, the leveraging of funding, resources and expertise from non-NASApartners, NASA Programs and Projects and NASA Centers. This Call to NASA Centers is soliciting proposals for cost-shared partnerships withindustry, academia, research institutions, national laboratories and other governmentagencies for joint development of technology that is of Mission interest to NASA. Awardsmade under this Call are contingent upon NASA budget appropriations and fundingavailability. This solicitation is being distributed through the NASA Center IPP Offices(IPPO). In order to solicit external interest for partnerships through this Call, thisAnnouncement is posted to Fedbizops.gov. For more information, please visit the Seed Fundwebsite: http://ipp.nasa.gov/ti_seed_fund.htm	  .  Responses to this Announcement mustinvolve partnerships with NASA and be received from NASA personnel participating as aPartnership Manager (PM) in the Center IPP Office; with proposals including both aninternal NASA Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI) and an External Co-PI. Proposalssubmitted directly from parties external to NASA will not be accepted. Proposed projects, due for submission by April 30, 2009, must include one or morenon-NASA partners in addition to non-IPP NASA partners who are committed to cost-share ata desired level at least equal to or greater than the IPP funding provided to theproject. For prior Seed Fund projects in the aggregate, additional internal NASAresources have typically matched IPP funds with external resources matching total NASAresources for a nearly 4:1 total leveraging for the project, relative to the IPP funding.Higher leveraging is desired and may enable more awards. Acceptable cost-sharing from thepartner excludes any sunk costs and includes only actual dollars applied directly to theproject, in-kind considerations such as workforce labor and the use of unique anddedicated facilities and testbeds. Monetary valuation of partner in-kind facility and/ortestbed access should be based solely on actual costs incurred by the partner in theperformance of the proposed project, and should not reflect the partner'salready-incurred cost for developing the technology including the original capitalexpenditure for construction of the subject facilities and/or testbeds. For further information and questions regarding this announcement, including the fullPartnership Seed Fund Call for Proposals  2009, visit the IPP Seed Fund website(http://ipp.nasa.gov/ti_seed_fund.htm	  ) or kindly contact the IPP Points of Contactat any of the ten NASA Centers listed below.

<DESC>The Information Technology Acquisition Center (ITAC), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), is pleased to issue this solicitation for the FirstSource program.  This procurement is being conducted by the ITAC in cooperation with the DHS Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the DHS Component IT and procurement communities. This final solicitation replaces the draft issued on August 9, 2005.ITACs primary goal of the FirstSource acquisition is to establish a portfolio of IT commodity contracts that are available for use throughout the Department.  The FirstSource Program will support the DHS goal of promoting a functionally integrated Department with standardized equipment consistent with the Enterprise Architecture (EA) initiative among the Departments Components. DHS needs access to technological advances and new business practices as they occur that may increase productivity, efficiency, and/or reduce costs while leveraging DHSs Department-wide buying power to obtain lowest possible prices. 
The FirstSource Program Objectives are to: 1. Maintain competitive prices for all offered IT commodity products by leveraging DHS buying-power by combining requirements on an enterprise-wide basis and through the contractor sponsored Dynamic Pricing Model; 2. Maintain continuous access to new IT technology consistent with the DHS Enterprise Architecture, as the technology is introduced to the commercial marketplace through the contractors commercial catalog; and 3. Meet DHS customer requirements for IT commodities, special delivery needs, and related services throughout the term of the contract. 
The method for accomplishing these objectives is to provide DHS with access to a wide variety of commercial catalogs for IT commodity products from multiple Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). The resulting contracts will include, but not be limited to IT equipment and software, networking equipment, wireless technology, imaging products, voice recognition technology, on-line data reporting services for order, delivery, warranty, asset, and spend tracking, and associated services. The high level equipment descriptions are intended to provide sufficient flexibility to meet a comprehensive range of potential agency requirements. Specific equipment, delivery, and performance requirements will be defined in individual delivery orders that will be competed prior to their issuance.
The FirstSource procurement is a 100% Small Business set-aside using NAICS Code 541519; the business size standard is 150 employees. FirstSource is a complementary program to the EAGLE program.  EAGLE contractors may use FirstSource as a source for any equipment requirements in their task orders issued under EAGLE. The FirstSource procurement will result in multiple IDIQ contracts.  Contract term is a two-year base period with three one-year options. 
The Source Selection will be conducted using a best value analysis. Evaluation factors for award will emphasize price, technical and management solutions, and past performance. Offerors will be required to propose their published, commercial IT commodity catalogs for any or all of the required products. Prices for products included in the offeror catalogs will be based on the offeror proposed Dynamic Pricing Model (DPM). 
Any inquiries shall be made in writing via email to DHS at dhsfirstsource@dhs.gov.

<DESC><p>This pre-solicitation synopsis is for Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS) Funds Administration Services requirement. This synopsis is prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2. The Federal Communications Commission (Commission) intends to select a Contractor to assume the roles and responsibilities of the Interstate TRS Fund Administrator (Administrator). The Administrator shall be responsible for all functions associated with administering the Interstate TRS Fund (Fund) including (1) collecting monies from covered interstate common carriers and VoIP providers to create the Fund; (2) developing annual compensation rates, in accordance with Commission guidance, for the various forms of TRS; (3) determining the annual Fund size and carrier contribution factor based on the compensation rates and projected minutes of use for each form of TRS; (4) paying monies from the Fund to eligible TRS providers to compensate them for their reasonable costs of providing TRS; (5) advising the Commission on cost-recovery issues and managing and safeguarding the Fund; and (6) Implementing effective internal controls in accordance with the standards and guidelines established in OMB Circular A-123. The Administrator is responsible for administering and managing the Fund in an efficient, effective manner to ensure that people with disabilities enjoy the benefits of the program as Congress intended. The Contractor shall assume the Administrator functions from the entity currently performing these functions. Title IV of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which added section 225 to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Act), requires the Commission to ensure that TRS is available to persons with hearing and speech disabilities. Specifically, section 225 of the Act instructs the Commission to ensure that TRS is available, &ldquo;to the extent possible and in the most efficient manner,&rdquo; to persons with hearing or speech disabilities in the United States. The statute requires each common carrier offering &ldquo;telephone voice transmission services&rdquo; to offer TRS to persons with hearing and speech disabilities that is &ldquo;functionally equivalent&rdquo; to voice telephone service. TRS is available nationwide, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, so that persons with hearing and speech disabilities can make calls to, and receive calls from, voice telephone users. In some circumstances, TRS equipment also permits persons with hearing disabilities to communicate directly with each other (although such calls are not TRS calls). Initially, only interstate TTY-based TRS (&ldquo;traditional TRS&rdquo;) minutes were reimbursed from the Fund; however, today the Fund reimburses relay service providers for several forms of TRS. These are: (1) interstate traditional TRS; (2) interstate Speech-to-Speech (STS); (3) interstate captioned telephone service (CTS); (4) interstate and intrastate IP Relay; (5) interstate and intrastate Video Relay Service (VRS); and (6) interstate and intrastate Internet Protocol (IP) captioned telephone service (IP CTS). Required services are to cover a one-year base period and four one-year option periods. The Government anticipates the release of Solicitation No. SOL09000002 within 2 to 3 weeks predicated on a full and open competition basis. The Government anticipates a vendor response time of 90 days after release of solicitation. Although it is the Government&rsquo;s intent to release the solicitation electronically via Government Point of Entry (GPE), potential sources interested in receiving a copy of the solicitation must contact Tony Wimbush, Contracts Specialist/Contracting Officer, FCC/Contracts &amp; Purchasing Center, at 202-418-0932 or via email at anthony.wimbush@fcc.gov. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.</p>

<DESC><p>COMMERCIAL SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE<br />________________________________________<br />GENERAL INFORMATION<br />Document Type: Request for Information and Sources Sought Notice <br />Solicitation Number: MSC-NGW<br />Posted Date: 02 February 2009, Amended 19 February 2009<br />Original Response Date: 03 March 2009<br />Current Response Date: 03 March 2009<br />Original Archive Date: 24 March 2009<br />Current Archive Date: 24 March 2009<br />Classification Code: D - Information Technology Services, including Telecommunications Services<br />NAICS Code: 517410 - Satellite Telecommunications Carriers/Resellers
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION<br />PURPOSE: The purpose of this announcement is to encourage your company to respond to<br />the RFI. This is market research to assist the government in its ability to<br />meet its needs. The purpose of publishing this notice is two-fold. First, it is a Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research which will be used to formulate an acquisition strategy for turnkey "solution provider engineered" space segment services, supporting hardware/software, and lifecycle support services necessary to provide end-to-end Internet Protocol (IP) communications connecting the global Military Sealift Command (MSC) maritime/mobile platforms to the two fixed shore-side MSC Continental United States (CONUS) Network Operation Centers (NOCs). This should be an all-inclusive integrated solution that will require minimum MSC effort to install, operate, and maintain.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is a sources sought notice for small businesses that can provide the required services under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 517410, Satellite Telecommunications Carriers/Resellers. All small businesses to include Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone, Women-Owned and Service Disabled are strongly encouraged to provide timely responses to this RFI. A response to this RFI will assist DISA in determining the potential levels of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability within the small business community to provide the required services. In addition, this information will be used to establish a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract/small business participation plan small business goal percentages. This Sources Sought Synopsis is issued to assist the agency in performing market research to determine whether there are qualified and capable small businesses to provide turnkey commercial satellite communications service to MSC.</p>
<p>Request small business respond and discuss your company's ability to perform in accordance with the Limitations on Subcontracting clause (FAR 52.219-14). Interested small businesses meeting the small business standard of NAICS code 517410 are requested to submit a response to this RFI. Please include your DUNS number and CAGE code and a statement of self-certification under the NAICS code. Request your response include recent (within the past 5 years) and relevant experience (work similar in type and scope) to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contact with telephone numbers where the offeror performed the relevant work. Although marketing brochures and generic company literature may contain pertinent information, these would not be sufficient for the Government to determine capability of the business to perform the scope of work required.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal or a promise to issue a Request for Proposal in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>TARGET AUDIENCE: Satellite operators, managed service providers, and satellite system engineering and integration resellers and integrators who can integrate and provide turnkey end-to-end integrated Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) services, infrastructure, and operations for MSC. In particular, small businesses are requested to respond to this RFI to assist MSC in formulating an acquisition strategy that fairly considers small business ability to participate in the acquisition, either as prime contractors or as subcontractors.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: COMSATCOM is an essential component of today's DoD communications. Current capacity of on-orbit Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) systems cannot meet the increasing communications demands of the joint warfighters.</p>
<p>MSC intends to implement the Next Generation Wideband (NGW) technology to replace/upgrade the current MSC Afloat Bandwidth Efficient Satellite Transport (BEST) COMSATCOM infrastructure. The BEST system has provided MSC with robust service connectivity for voice, data, and imagery, both secure and non-secure, for both classified and unclassified missions. More than 70 MSC vessels currently have their voice and data networks connected to the MSC Ashore Enterprise via BEST. MSC implemented the BEST solution as an overlay to its existing legacy International Maritime Satellite (Inmarsat) infrastructure. The BEST solution has achieved efficiencies on the order of 300 percent relative to the legacy Inmarsat architectures previously used by MSC. The annual recurring operating cost for MSC has remained virtually the same, while service throughput tripled and changed from periodic narrowband voice or data to full period wideband multimedia voice, data, Internet, and intranet (SIPRNET and NIPRNET).</p>
<p>The following events have necessitated the replacement of the BEST infrastructure:<br />&bull; The BEST Satellite Communications (SATCOM) services infrastructure is no longer able to satisfy expanding MSC mission requirements.<br />&bull; The current SATCOM terminals utilized by BEST (NERA Bm) are reaching end-of-life.<br />&bull; The supporting Inmarsat satellite constellation is nearing end-of-life.</p>
<p>As a follow-up to this RFI, DISA may host an Industry Days unclassified event, including one-on-one sessions between DoD and industry representatives, allowing for a more engaging exchange with the satellite industry. Attendance may be limited to businesses which respond to this RFI. Additional information regarding the conference agenda would be released in advance of Industry Days.</p>
<p>Market Research:</p>
<p>The following questions are intended to help structure a potential future COMSATCOM services acquisition that effectively leverages the commercial marketplace, delivering COMSATCOM services in concert with industry best practices to meet unique MSC goals and objectives. The preliminary Statement of Objectives (SOO) (Attachment A) provides insight into the planned Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) for a potential acquisition. Questions pertain to the full range of COMSATCOM services, as applicable, including fixed and mobile satellite services, managed services, as well as any potential future service offerings. We welcome additional insights beyond the specific questions in this RFI that vendors may be able to offer to help shape our potential acquisition.</p>
<p>1. Given the information contained in the SOO, what would you recommend to meet MSC's objectives? For example, but not limited to: <br />a. Where have we offered too few constraints and why? What else is needed?<br />b. Where have we offered too many constraints and why? What should be deleted?<br />c. Would any specific type of solution provide particular advantages to MSC based on this SOO? Please briefly define this solution and type and rationale or advantages.<br />d. What future technological improvements/enhancements may become available to MSC?</p>
<p>2. Are there any requirements within the SOO that are technically challenging? If yes, please explain further and suggest alternative strategies that could mitigate the implications of these technical challenges.</p>
<p>3. Does the way the SOO is worded or the vastness of the coverage requirements pose particular challenges? Are there any particular aspects that unduly drive cost? How could a slightly modified requirement offer potential for significant cost savings?</p>
<p>4. Is any aspect of the equipment and installation requirements particularly difficult or expensive? Please elaborate.</p>
<p>5. To understand the capability of available maritime COMSATCOM equipment to support our performance requirements, please provide any information that conveys the size and performance for antennas and terminals in a shipboard environment. Ship movement and satellite handover are of particular interest.</p>
<p>6. How would you recommend that we support a potential surge in bandwidth requirements in a certain area of the world? (For example, a sudden shift of many ships to a particular location.) How could costs be optimized for this type of requirement expansion?</p>
<p>7. Given MSC's varying mission locations, portability of services between regions may be required. MSC is interested to learn more about commercial best practices regarding portability of services.<br />a. How does industry define portability of COMSATCOM services?<br />b. How does industry approach the delivery of portability to MSC? What is required for industry to "guarantee" portability of services? What terms and conditions are associated with portability?<br />c. What types of costs are there and under what circumstances may they be incurred? How could these costs be minimized?<br />d. What new systems architectures could make portability of services easier to execute and utilize, and/or more cost effective (e.g., network managed service)?<br />e. Are there any innovative approaches or capabilities within industry that MSC should be aware of? How would these approaches or capabilities impact MSC's acquisition of COMSATCOM services?</p>
<p>8. MSC requires COMSATCOM shipboard installation and support services to be performed anywhere in the world. Explain how your company provides worldwide installation and support services.</p>
<p>9. MSC desires end-to-end situational awareness into its satellite and terrestrial communications systems to evaluate the impact of performance degradation and outages to ongoing and planned missions. Therefore, MSC would like to leverage commercially available operational information to the maximum extent possible. MSC requests information to help examine how to best access commercially available information providing end-to-end situational awareness of provisioned services:<br />o Spectral monitoring of all MSC leased bandwidth and provisioned services;<br />o Service performance data (e.g., EIRP, BER, Eb/No, C/kT); and<br />o Configuration changes in equipment used to support MSC leased COMSATCOM services.<br />MSC wishes to leverage industry best practices for management, monitoring, and control resources to the maximum extent possible to provide situational awareness of end-to-end provisioned services such as notification of planned and unplanned outages, interference events, intrusion detection events, and component degradation.<br />a. Are there any aspects of monitoring and control which would incur or could be added with extra costs?<br />b. Please provide technical details and articulate what information with what frequency and delay can be made available to a customer.<br />c. Please provide your strategy for interference monitoring and detection (interference to and by MSC users).<br />d. What situational awareness information is normally collected within industry as part of day-to-day operations? Are there any open/industry standards defining how this data is collected and managed?<br />e. To what extent does the situational awareness information referenced in Question 1 already exist and to what extent is it available to be provided to MSC? How close to real time could the information be made available?<br />f. How consistent is your company's ability to support this need across the globe? If inconsistent, what is the basis and how might this be resolved?<br />g. What type of trouble tracking capability and information is currently in use and can industry provide to MSC? What is considered a reportable service outage?<br />h. What construct for Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with respect to situational awareness are typical within the commercial industry? What experience does your company have with commitments on service availability, anomaly resolution, etc.?<br />i. What situational awareness data would your company be unwilling to share with the Government?<br />j. How does your company share planned outages and unplanned outages and what are the typical response times?</p>
<p>10. Given the fundamental importance of commercial satellite communications services to the warfighters, secure and uninterrupted service and timely anomaly resolution is a critical service requirement. MSC must carefully consider the most effective way to attain cost-effective mission supporting services while meeting unique DoD requirements. <br />a. How is your company positioned to support DoD security requirements, specifically:<br />o Personnel with U.S. Secret or NATO Secret Clearances;<br />o Secure facilities with an approved Facilities Security Clearance;<br />o Secure communications (e.g., STU/STE);<br />o Electromagnetic Interference/Radio Frequency Interference incident resolution; and<br />o Certification/accreditation of information systems in accordance with DoD policies and procedures, e.g., NIST, FISMA, DIACAP, etc.<br />b. Do you foresee any change in the future?<br />c. How consistent is your company's ability to support this need across the globe? If inconsistent, what is the basis and how might this be resolved?<br />d. If foreign owned, what steps have you taken (or do you plan to take), to best meet DoD security needs?<br />e. What lessons learned from past experience in providing services to DoD customers can be leveraged to better facilitate the delivery of robust COMSATCOM services?</p>
<p>11. The SOO currently requires global homogenous capacity based on Kpbs. We also may require incremental capacity either globally or regionally during parts of the period of performance. We would like to understand how this deviates from the way that industry typically would sell bandwidth to a geographically diverse customer. In addition:<br />a. Would you recommend an alternative or more defined breakout of bandwidth requirements?<br />b. Considering that a user typically can get more Kbps per KHz near the center of a satellite beam, and considering that our requirement includes homogenous Kbps threshold and objective levels, what are the implications and what alternative may better align with industry practices?<br />c. How might prices best be broken out (i.e., CLINs) and proposed for us to most effectively assess costs for our baseline and any future bandwidth requirements?<br />d. How might we best leverage scale economies, both for our baseline as well as any future bandwidth purchases?</p>
<p>12. To provide us a vector against our estimates and program funding, please provide rough estimates for costs against the high level comprehensive list of cost elements below:<br />Cost Element Annual Recurring Costs Total Non Recurring Costs<br />Satellite Bandwidth % % <br />Terrestrial % % <br />Equipment % % <br />Installation % % <br />Integration % % <br />Lifecycle Support % %<br />Total 5 year ROM $ $</p>
<p>a. Which requirements or aspects in the SOO drive costs? Why?<br />b. Which requirements or aspects in the SOO could be modified to reduce costs?<br />c. Please discuss possible modifications and potential impacts on costs.<br />d. Which requirements or aspects in the SOO have an opportunity to be modified to reduce costs/optimize value?</p>
<p>13. What is a rough estimate for the time from award of contract to Initial Operating Capability (IOC) for the first ship? What are the primary drivers of this timeframe? Which requirements or aspects in the SOO drive schedule? How can these be streamlined from an MSC perspective? Is the proposed equipment deployment/installation schedule in 5.5.3 attainable?</p>
<p>14. MSC may require offerors, deemed to be in the competitive range, to undergo Prototype Testing. The primary purpose of the testing is to validate the performance and assess the usability of the systems proposed by the leading RFP offerors. The test results would be utilized in the down-select process to determine which offeror would receive awards to implement production pilots. We want to minimize cost and schedule impacts. The NGW RFP Prototype Testbed consists of three network infrastructures representing two ships and one NOC within the STF laboratory facility in Chesapeake, VA. The two "ship" network infrastructures will be connected to two complete ship sets of offeror-owned satellite equipment (including VoIP gateways). The "NOC" network will interconnect with the two "ship" network infrastructures via a backhaul link to the offeror-designated Land Earth Station (LES). Each offeror selected for prototype testing would provide, at their expense, the following resources in support of the testing effort:<br />a. Satellite infrastructure (as specified in the applicable proposal) to equip two ships;<br />b. Terrestrial infrastructure (as specified in the applicable proposal) to equip one NOC;<br />c. LES resources to support the two ships and one NOC (including the backhaul link from the LES to Chesapeake, VA);<br />d. Personnel to install, operate, and support the satellite infrastructure;<br />e. Personnel to provide appropriate instruction in use of the solution;<br />f. Applicable satellite infrastructure documentation; and<br />g. Offerors will be given at least seven days notice prior to the testing initiation. Following offeror equipment installation and operation verification, testing duration will be no more than three 8-hour periods over 3 consecutive days.<br />Do you foresee any problems with this requirement? What timeline would you expect to be necessary? How might this influence industry responses and willingness to participate?</p>
<p>15. Can you offer any other insights or recommendations not articulated in this RFI that may help shape this potential acquisition? What are the benefits to MSC for your recommendations?</p>
<p>Additional Requested Information:<br />1. Request your response describe your company's demonstrated ability to perform the work detailed in the above background section and in the following specific areas:<br />a. Leasing FSS C-, X-, Ku-, and/or Ka-band bandwidth and/or procuring MSS airtime on a worldwide basis on behalf of an enterprise consumer from multiple global and regional providers. Please include the amount of bandwidth leased and how this experience can be applied to the scale necessary to support MSC.<br />b. Determining feasibility (e.g., link budget analysis) and leasing technical solutions in response to high-level communications requirements including obtaining licenses and host nation agreements/landing rights to activate the leased service. Include metrics (shortest, average, and longest) on the companies' observed ability to obtain host nation agreements/landing rights.<br />c. Implementing strategies that optimize performance or minimize enterprise lease costs (e.g., combining multiple service requests across services/geographic areas to achieve economic order quantities) in an ongoing or long-term basis.<br />d.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC), Technology Evaluation Branch in support of the Joint Program Manager (JPM) for Biological Defense, is sponsoring a Technology Readiness Evaluation, (TRE) 09-1 for the Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) Identifier.<BR><BR>The purpose of the TRE is to evaluate mature and advanced prototype biological warfare agent identification technologies using nucleic and/or non-nucleic acid detection that are fully or semi-automated.<BR><BR>Vendors both domestic and international are encouraged to respond to this opportunity with hardware and data demonstrating (a.) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 or higher, (b.) ability to automatically conduct a simultaneous analysis for eight (8) or more antigens in a single two (2) milliliter liquid sample in a buffer (phosphate buffered saline, (PBS) with 0.1 % Triton at 7.4 pH) down to the species level, (c.) identify blind samples within sixty (60) minutes from time of sample introduction (includes sample prep time, if any), and (d.) performance that has at least a 90% probability of identification at 80% confidence for limit of identification of biological challenge materials. The challenge materials are: one live vegetative bacterium vaccine strain, crude and washed inactivated bacteria spores, and two inactivated viruses at approximate concentrations of 2000 cfu/ml for spores, 1000 cfu/ml for vegetative bacteria, and 800 pfu/ml for viruses, five (5) percent or less probability of false identification, consumable operating cost less than $75 per sample challenge, size and weight or potential to be no greater than one and a half (1.5) cubic feet, and thirty seven (37) lbs. in carry configuration with sufficient consumables to analyze ten (10) samples, temperature and power operation from ten (10) degrees to forty (40) degrees Celsius, Power- standard military batteries, and potential or capability to identify additional antigens automatically (Expandability).<BR><BR>Plans are underway to conduct the JBTDS identification TRE in two (2) phases. Phase I is an assessment phase consisting of a review of the white paper proposals followed by a determination of eligibility. Candidates will be invited to proceed to Phase II and participate in a laboratory evaluation based upon a positive assessment of the information contained in their White Paper concerning the following criteria: (a.) Probability of Identification and Probability of False Identification without Interferents, (b.) Limit of identification and dynamic Range of Concentration, (c.)

<DESC>Amended Notice to delete reference to attached drawings and revise anticipated solicitation issuance date. The plans and specifications will be issued with the solicitation. The solicitation is anticipated to be issued on or about 02 March 2009.<BR><BR><BR>The NAICS code for this requirement is 237990. An Invitation For Bids (IFB) will be issued in accordance with FAR Subpart 14.2 and FAR Subpart 36.213-3. The magnitude of this project is between $25,000,000.00 to $100,000,000.00. This announcement is UNRESTRICTED and open to all businesses regardless of size. <BR><BR>The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Hurricane Protection Office has a firm fixed-price construction services requirement for the Rehabilitation of Hurricane Gustav and Ike Damage, Grand Isle and Vicinity, Jefferson, Parish, LA. . Award will be made to that responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the IFB, will be most advantageous to the Government, considering only price and the price-related factors included in the invitation. <BR><BR>Project Information. Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, materials, vehicles, equipment, tools, insurance, supervision, and transportation, and incidental services to perform the rehabilitation repairs at Grand Isle. The majority of the dune at Grand Isle is to be reconstructed with a geotextile tube core and sand cap. The geotextile tube core will be 30,100 feet or about 5.7 miles long. The tubes will be filled with material from excavation of the existing dune with limited fine content. The Corps has installed ~7620 ft of geotextile wrapped clay to an elevation near 9 ft NAVD88. The geotextile tube will overlap the ends of this clay structure on the gulf side by approximately 50 ft. The tubes are to be coated on the top 50% of its surface area with a synthetic polyurea spray-on coating applied at the factory for UV resistance as well as abrasion resistance. Twenty locations have been designated for pedestrian crossings along with six emergency vehicle access locations. The pedestrian crossings will be constructed similar to highway on-ramps that run up the side of the dune slope, over the top of the dune, and then back down the opposite side. The tubes and existing clay structure will be capped with sand and parts of the beach will be nourished. This material will come from the designated offshore site. The type of dredge is restricted to any dredge method other than a hopper dredge. The total volume of material to be dredged is approximately 1 Million cubic yards (CY) of sandy material. Geo textile tubes and anchor tubes will be filled with a slurry. Typical earthwork construction equipment will be used for establishing the required sand cover depth (minimum of 3 ft) and width (approx. 80 ft) over the geotextile tube dune core. The beach sand will be spread out in the same manner. The contractor will use a dredge pipeline to transfer material to the beach. . The wearing surface of the pedestrian crossings will be a roll-out mat system. The emergency vehicle crossings will be constructed of Articulated Concrete Block (ACB) mats. Sand Fencing will be constructed along the dune. .All dune construction will be planted. <BR><BR>Construction completion is 170 days after notice to proceed. First order of work is excavating the existing dune and installing the geotextile tube core. The time stated for completion of all work does not include demobilization, final cleanup of the work area, or dune planting. Dune planting may commence February 1st of 2010 and must be complete 60 days after February 1st.to take advantage of proper growing season. <BR><BR>IFB is anticipated to be issued on or about February 23, 2009. The closing date and time for submission of bids will be contained in the subsequent IFB solicitation package. Bid Opening Date will also be provided in solicitation. The solicitation documents for this procurement will be posted via Army Single Face to Industry (AFSI) to the following website: www.fedbizopps.gov in Portable Document Format (*.pdf).

<DESC>Y- PRE SOLICITATION SYNOPSIS

This solicitation is for the design and construction of the Coast Guard (CG) Rescue Swimmer Training Facility (RSTF) at USCG Support Center Elizabeth City, North Carolina.  The project acquisition strategy is a best value, two-step Design-Build.
    
The new RSTF will be a single-story building with an outdoor sports-turf field.  The RSTF shall be adjacent to Buildings 4, 6, and 8.  The site is paved with concrete, which must be demolished and removed prior to construction.  The RSTF is approximately 50,000 square feet.  The RSTF space program includes but is not limited to: a Rescue Swimmer training pool (25m x 50m), a Modular Egress Training Simulator (METS) pool (35ft x 60ft), a fitness room with a sports trainer office, locker rooms, wet storage, lecture classrooms, inflatables lab, oxygen lab, pump shop, administrative offices, public areas, and facility support spaces.  The RSTF shall also be designed to meet the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certified level.  The Rescue Swimmer training pool shall be specialized and possess many technological features capable of simulating a real-world environment.  This pool is the cornerstone of the RSTF and shall be equipped two 12 jump towers, moveable bulkhead, wave generator, rotor wash simulator, fog generator, parachute hoist, ropes course, helicopter search light, dusk and night simulation, and a sound system to name a few features.
Another significant space within the RSTF is the METS pool, which shall be used to provide emergency egress training.  The METS shall provide a high degree of realism and flexibility through the use of moveable and interchangeable panels, bulkheads, seats, and exits.  These modular components shall closely simulate the specific characteristics of the common Coast Guard helicopters.  The lifting or hoist system shall provide a high level of safety, reliability, and user friendly options that are available for aircraft ditching training.

The estimated magnitude of this construction project is more than $10,000,000.00.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this acquisition is 236220 and the small business size standard is $31.0 Million.  The estimated time for completion is 720 days.  THIS PROCUREMENT IS 100% SET-ASIDE FOR THE HISTORICALLY UNDERUTILIZED BUSINESS ZONE (HUBZONE) SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.  (Status as a qualified HUBZone small business concern is determined by the Small Business Administration (SBA) and SBA will issue a certification to that affect in accordance with 13 CFR part 126)  Offers that are not from qualified HUBZone small business concerns shall not be considered and shall be rejected.  The Congress in authorizing and funding this project has established certain cost limitations for the project.  No award can be made for the design and construction of this project which with allowances for government imposed contingencies and overhead exceeds the statutory authorization.  Proposals whose price for design and construction exceed the funds available may be rejected.

The solicitation, when issued, will be formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with the requirements designated by FAR 15.203 for a competitive negotiated procurement utilizing the authorized Two-Phase Design-Build selection procedures of FAR 36.3.  Proposals will be evaluated in Phase I to determine which offerors will be selected to submit proposals for Phase II.  A maximum of seven (7) offerors will be selected to submit Phase II proposals; however, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to advance more or less than that number should the circumstances so dictate.  Detailed project design requirements will then be added by amendment to the solicitation at the start of the Phase II stage of the Request for Proposals.  The proposal due date for Phase II will be established by amendment after the completion of Phase I.  Phase II proposals will be evaluated on technical factors and a price factor.

<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS BEING ISSUED UNDER THE SMALL BUSINESS COMPETITIVENESS DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR SUBPART 19.10 AND WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. The target ceiling for contract award for design and construction is $14,500,000.00. The Government cannot guarantee that additional funds can be made available for award. Offerors are under no obligation to approach this amount. This project is for the Design and Construction of a Hazardous Material Response Facility consisting of a laboratory, conference and general use space for the Pentagon Force Protection Agency at the Pentagon Reservation in Arlington, Virginia. 

The Design-Build process will have two distinct phases. Phase-I will be the pre-qualification process, where the Government will select 3 to 5 Design-Build Contractors on the basis of Project Organization and Personnel, Offeror's Experience and Resource Commitment, Management Control Systems, Past Performance, Management/Technical Compliance Certification, and Financial Capacity. The elements are listed in descending order of importance with Project Organization and Personnel being the most important and the remaining elements becoming increasingly less important.

Only the selected Design-Build Contractors will then qualify for the Phase-II of the process. In Phase-II of the procurement procedure, offerors will be given the opportunity to offer their preliminary design and cost proposals. Final selection and basis for award of the design-build contract will be on the basis of Qualifications, Technical Quality, Price, and Other Salient Factors considered being in the Government's best interests. The elements are listed in descending order of importance with Qualifications being the most important and the remaining elements becoming increasingly less important. This is not a low bid award project. If awarded the contract, the offeror shall complete the design and construction documents and construct the facility in compliance with these completed requirements. The building could be two stories and shall be sited to increase visibility and impact from the initial approach to the building. The Design/Build Contractor shall design the new building shall complement other structures in the area around the building. However, design and construction creativity and innovation is encouraged. 

Plans and Specifications will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Web Page at http://www.fbo.gov/. Offerors may register on the Interested Vendors List (IVL) at http://www.fbo.gov/ and retrieve an IVL from the same location. All technical inquiries and questions relating to this solicitation are to be submitted via e-mail to JoAnn Avants at joann.avants@whs.mil and Gregory Lindsey at gregory.lindsey.ctr@whs.mil. Compact disc and hardcopies will not be available. Offerors should check often for changes (Amendments).
