<DESC><strong>Synopsis: <br />THIS IS A SAVE THE DATE SITE VISIT NOTICE. <br /><br />THIS IS <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> A FORMAL SOLICITATION [INVITATION FOR BID (IFB)] OR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). PLEASE <span style="text-decoration: underline;">DO NOT</span> SUBMIT A PROPOSAL.</strong>
<p><strong><br />GENERAL INFORMATION:</strong> The 772d Enterprise Sourcing Squadron/Environmental Contracting (772 ESS/PKB) is considering a performance-based approach for Site Closeout (SC) involving remedial action efforts at McConnell Air Force Base, KS. The Performance Based Remediation (PBR) for McConnell is anticipated to be 100% set aside for Small Business; however, the Acquisition Strategy has not been approved for this requirement. It has not been determined if this requirement will be issued under a Small Business Set-Aside or under Full and Open Competition. This requirement will be processed using FAR Part 15 procedures and will result in a "C" type contract, NOT a task order under an Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) contract. [Formerly the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE)] If the Air Force elects to proceed with this requirement, a formal solicitation will be finalized and posted to FedBizOpps at a later date. <br /><br /><strong>PROJECT NARRATIVE:</strong> Performance-Based Remediation (PBR) emphasizes results in terms of environmental clean-up for an entire installation (fence-to-fence), or group of installations, in lieu of a study-based approach. The PBR approach looks for technically and cost-effective methods for achieving this clean-up by focusing on achievement of desired objectives without specifying the processes or technologies for obtaining those objectives. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The POP is estimated at 120 months (10 years) from date of award. The estimated Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) anticipated for any resultant contract is between $60,000,000 and $80,000,000. This ROM is an estimate range only and is provided only for informational purposes. <br /><br /><strong>SITE VISIT INFORMATION:</strong> Currently in order to meet time schedules, the Air Force is requesting that individuals planning to attend the Site Visit submit the names of the individuals attending. The Site Visit will be on 30 Oct 2012 (the 29th and 31st may be travel days depending on your location) at McConnell AFB, KS. Attendance at this Site Visit is not mandatory and is at the sole discretion of each firm. The Government will not reimburse participating firms for Site Visit costs. We can only accommodate two individuals per firm. The names of interested parties will be added to a list of attendees. <strong>Each person attending the site visit will need to submit the following information to <a href="mailto:Christal.Rhoades@us.af.mil">Christal.Rhoades@us.af.mil</a> &nbsp;and <a href="mailto:Ana.Jimenez@us.af.mil">Ana.Jimenez@us.af.mil</a> &nbsp;NLT 10 Oct 2012 at 2:00 pm CT. If your company fails to submit the attendee names by the requested time and date, your company will not be allowed to attend the site visit due to strict security concerns. There will be NO EXCEPTIONS.</strong></p>
<p>1) Name and Title of individual, including first and last name<br />2) Company Name<br />3) Daytime Phone number of personnel attending the site visit<br />4) Date of Birth<br />5) Driver's license #<br />6) State of Issuance for Driver's License</p>
<p>Please note that each attendee will be contacted directly by e-mail for their Social Security Number (SSN). This is required by the Base as part of their security requirements. The attendees will be sent the specific site visit details via e-mail such as meeting location, agenda, and times prior to the Site Visit on 30 Oct 2012.<br /><br /><strong>Please copy the Contracting Officer, Ms. Ana Jimenez, and Contract Specialist, Ms. Christal Rhoades on all correspondence. Other than site visit attendee information, no further information is requested at this time. <br /><br /></strong>Additional information is also provided for your review to assist you for preparation of the site visit. The following documents are included as uploaded attachments to this notice: <br />DRAFT Statement of Objectives (SOO), dated 2 Oct 2012<br />DRAFT SOO Enclosure 1, Site List, dated 2 Oct 2012<br />DRAFT SOO Enclosure 2, Key Documents List, dated 2 Oct 2012<br />DRAFT SOO Enclosure 5, Acronyms and Definitions, dated 2 Oct 2012<br />Estimated Bonding Stream for the McConnell PBR</p>

This email is closely monitored by support staff and all requests will be processed as soon as possible. Phone support is also available during FTP hours of operation; if you reach the voicemail please leave your contact information and follow up with an email when possible. <br /><br /><strong>ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI)</strong>: An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action.</p>
<p>In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5 and 36.209, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Vandenberg AFB may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.</p>
<p>a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.</p>
<p>b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).</p>
<p>c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests).</p>
<p>Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.</p>
<p>Place of Performance will be at McConnell Air Force Base (AFB), KS.<br /><br />Procuring Contracting Office Address:<br />772 ESS/PKB<br />2261 Hughes Ave, Ste 163<br />Lackland AFB, Texas 78236-9853</p>

<DESC>Notice Type: Special Announcement

Synopsis:  PMS 408 EOD/CREW/ATA Program Office is hosting an Anti-Terrorism Afloat (ATA) multi-program UNCLASSIFIED Open Business Industry Information Exchange Day for the ATA acquisition programs.  This is not a Request for Proposal. NO SOLICITATION
DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME. These ATA programs include: 

Identity Dominance Systems (IDS) - Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) approved program of record designed to deliver an enduring biometric collection and identification capability for visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) teams in support of expanded maritime interception operations (EMIO).  It provides the ability to identify known or suspected terrorists and persons of interest in a maritime environment through collection and matching of fingerprint and iris biometric signatures, as well as the capture of facial images (mug shots) and miscellaneous documentation for mission context.

ATA programs are managed by PMS-408 EOD/CREW/ATA.
 The purpose of the ATA UNCLASSIFIED Open Business (OB) Industry Information Exchange Day is to increase Governments access to creative innovation while educating prospective vendors on strategies to provide new capabilities and services to our warfighters. This event is open to system integrators, innovators, manufacturers, and third party suppliers who meet the requirements to attend.

This UNCLASSIFIED Open Business Industry Information Exchange Day will discuss future acquisition strategies, for ATA programs, leveraging the benefits of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) and open architecture design elements to create the means for third-party technology innovators to participate in a coherent development, procurement and validation of system and sub-system level technology insertion /technology refresh (TI/TR).
  Currently, PMS-408 EOD/CREW/ATA plans for a series of incremental developments, for ATA programs, to enable new capabilities through technology insertion and technology refresh.  The overall system architectures open, modular and flexible design ensures the ability to upgrade the respective product baselines for performance, affordability, availability and reliability.  The incremental developments will allow:  1) New capabilities and technology insertion updates cut into the existing production line to include hardware, firmware or software, into existing production line about every two years, 2) Periodic technology refresh of fielded systems about every four years (retrofitting/replacing - fielded systems/solution) to maintain common baselines and to account for obsolescence while countering the rapidly evolving threat for both programs.
  

The ATA Programs have different technology refresh requirements.  The IDS consists of an integrated base unit (IBU), and peripherals that capture slap fingerprints and extract digital media.  The IBU is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) biometric computing platform that executes custom Government purpose software that generates certified EBTS records and provides optimized operator work flow, biometric matching algorithms, and digital media collection. 

The UNCLASSIFIED Industry Information Exchange Day will be held on 14 NOV 2012 at CACI Enterprise Solutions Inc., 4114 Legato Rd., Fairfax, VA 22033; attendance is limited to U.S. citizens only.  Directions to the CACI Enterprise Solutions Inc.
 building can be provided upon registration.  Space constraints make it necessary to limit attendance to two people per company. To register, please send email to:  JCREWIIEDay@navy.mil by 02 NOV 2012. The email shall include the participants full name, company they are representing, along with their titles and email addresses. 
     
On the day of the event, visitors will need to check in at the CACI Enterprise Solutions building for registration. The tentative agenda is below.  All the briefings will remain at the UNCLASSIFIED level presenting the acquisition strategy, the high-level system requirements, and future technology requirements. 

Some ATA NAICS Code:
334118  Biometrics system input device (e.g., retinal scan, iris pattern recognition,   
              hand geometry) manufacturing 
334111  Hand held computers (e.g., PDAs) manufacturing

334112  DVD (digital video disc) drives, computer peripheral equipment, manufacturing

  This is an interim action and the resultant contract will provide the requiring activity with the necessary services while the contracting office solicits and awards a contract or contracts through competitive procedures.  The instant requirement represents a follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly specialized services.  SRC, Inc. is currently providing the required services under order W91WAW-08-P-0101 and is the only known source that can reasonably be expected to continue to perform these services before the follow-on contract(s) is/are awarded, without incurring unacceptable delay, added cost, duplication of effort, and potentially jeopardizing the success of JS DDGO requirements.
  
The solicitation will be made available electronically, upon its release, at www.neco.navy.mil.  Interested parties are solely responsible for monitoring the above mentioned website for posting of the solicitation and any amendments thereto.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by 6 September 2012.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  However, the Government will consider information received by 6 September 2012.  Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.
  The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice.  The NAICS code is 541330 and the small business size standard is $14M.   Issuance of a competitive solicitation for the continuation of these services beyond the contract resulting from the instant sole source acquisition is anticipated around 1 April 2013.   For questions regarding this announcement, please contact Sean McGinley, Code 290.1A, at (215) 697-5025, or at sean.mcginley1@navy.mil.

<SOLNBR>N0024413R0002
<RESPDATE>101012
<ARCHDATE>10192012
<CONTACT>Joel E. Judy 619-556-6619
<DESC>The Fleet Logistics Center San Diego (FLCSD) intends to issue a Request for Proposal on an Unusual and Compelling Urgency basis to Tinosa LLC, 6151 Progressive Ave, Ste. 300, San Diego, CA  92154.  The proposed contract will provide Divers Life Support System (DLSS) Routine Maintenance Services.  These services include fabrication, maintenance, hydro testing, re-filling, and cleaning of:  high and low pressure piping, Valves, Flexible hoses, Filters, Moisture separators, Volume tanks, Compressed gas cylinders (Air, O2, and Mixed Gas), Compressed Gas Flask (Air, O2, and Mixed Gas), maintenance of Haskell Oxygen Booster Pumps, maintenance of Oxygen Transfer Pump Assembly, maintenance of all compressors (Bauer, VK-20, VT-12, K-220) and maintenance of Transportable Recompression Chamber to ensure that EODESU diver life support equipment is safe and operational to support Explosive Ordnance Disposal Expeditionary Support Unit One (EODESU ONE) and Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) missions.
The proposed contract will be for DLSS maintenance services for a period of 12 months.
  Urgency and compelling circumstances exist with EODESU ONE's late August 2012 establishment of Fly Away Recompression Chamber (FARC) Platoon to support EOD Underwater Mine Counter Measure (UMCM) and Anti-Terrorism Force Protection (ATFP).  The cornerstone of the FARC Platoons mission involves providing medical support for the EOD teams in the event of a diving casualty.  The main piece of equipment used for this function is the Transportable Recompression Chamber (TRCS), which EODESU ONE received in conjunction with standing up the FARC Platoon.  Maintenance must be accomplished by an O2 clean certified contractor.  If services are not obtained to clean and inspect the TRCS, the FARC Platoon cannot meet its deployment requirements which will halt EOD UMCM and ATFP operations in the aforementioned AOR.
  The same contractor must have an oxygen-clean free facility and be able to service this recompression chamber as well as be Bauer-and Haskell-certified to maintain the other equipment listed above and Tinosa, LLC, is the only firm with such qualifications.
Notice:  The proposed contract is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate on an unusual and compelling urgency basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-2.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all proposals received no later than 1200 PST, 10 OCT 2012 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
  Questions shall be submitted in writing to joel.judy@navy.mil.  This synopsis is being posted to the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) site located at www.neco.navy.mil and will also be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>The US EPA intends to procure on a sole source basis a ThermoFisher Scientific QExactive Benchtop Quadrupole Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (MS), Accela UHPLC system from THERMO ELECTRON NORTH AMERICA LLC.  for the Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL).  This system shall include electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) sources, Xcalibur software, gas phase chromatography interface, and all software and accessories necessary to detect and analyze mass spectra from a wide range of endogenous metabolites (i.e., biochemicals) present in a variety of biomatrices (e.g., biofluids, tissues, etc.) with a high degree of resolution, accuracy, and sensitivity.  EPA intends to use the GSA Schedule of ThermoFisher GS-24F-0026L for the main unit and intends to add the following non-schedule items to the resultant order as these items are to be integrated into the main unit in order to meet the need s of the Agency.  These open market items include: Kit, Column SW 10Port VLV, A/S, RoH;  Column Oven 300;  CTC Mount;  Heat Exchanger Low Volume;  Generator, Nitrogen, NM32LA, RoHS; SW, Sieve 1.3 SP2 For Metabolomics On;  EXACTFINDER 2.0;  ISQ Trace 1300 PERF BUNDLE ? 120 V;  Trace 1300 SSL W/BKF Injector Module;  GC/GCMS Start-up Kit;  RSH LIQUID TOOL: D7 57 MM;  RSH LIQUID TOOL: D7 85 MM;  RSH Agitator Adapter for 2ML Vial;  and RSH VORTEXER.
This system is needed to enhance the analytical capabilities of EPA researchers within the CSS National Research Program.   Chemical compounds to be routinely measured within the CCS program often have highly similar molecular mass at very low concentrations in biological matrices so EPA requires an instrument capable of generating spectra characterized by high mass resolution, mass accuracy, sensitivity, and wide dynamic range.  Similarly biological compounds to be routinely measured within a single sample can widely vary in concentration and ionizability such that a large dynamic range and the option for analyses by multiple ionization sources is a critical need.  The attributes of the requested instrumentation are of utmost importance for the success of the research as it will both decrease the ambiguity involved in chemical identification (high resolution and accuracy) and the detection limits (sensitivity), while increasing the comprehensive nature of the analyses (dynam ic range and multiple ionization modes). 
EPA is limited by the amount of benchtop space available in its laboratory facility to house the instrument.  The relatively small footprint of the ThermoFisher QExactive Benchtop Quadrupole Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer system is a critical consideration as laboratory space is minimal and any additional laboratory space is expected to be consumed by sample processing and storage instrumentation.  The ThermoFisher QExactive Benchtop Quadrupole Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer system provides the level of resolution, accuracy, sensitivity, throughput, and dynamic range essential for the detection and discrimination of the types of biological compounds (i.e., biochemicals) being investigated by ERD researchers within EPA?s space limitations.  The fast polarity switching capabilities and rapid rate of detection characteristic of this instrument are required to meet the high throughput nature of the research for which it will be used.  Further, the fast polarity switching offered by the Q Exactive will allow for a reduction in analysis time and solvent use. Both types of ionization (ESI +and ESI -) are needed for more comprehensive chemical detection. The use of fast polarity switching will provide for the acquisition of both types of data on the same sample thereby reducing LC solvent use.  Therefore, the item is also more efficient and will reduce the environmental impact (in accordance with environmental management systems guidelines) when compared to instruments.
THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  However, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this EPA requirement must submit technical documentation to establish its assertion.  This documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of the electronic posting of this notice.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the EPA.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The anticipated award date is October 25, 2012.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Energy Research Incorporated (ERI) for technical and scientific disciplines relating to tasks accomplishing tasks aimed at ensuring overall safety, security and adequacy of nuclear power plant design, construction and operations. The items being purchased through this posting will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 15-Contracting by Negotiation. The period of performance for this technical services support is five (5) years. The authority for negotiating on a sole-source basis with IBM is made under the authority of 41 U.S.C 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, which provides for limiting competition from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690 (Size Standard: $14 Million). This action is for technical assistance services relating to the new license applications for GE Hitachi ABWR. ERI possesses unique experience and expertise on this specific design center and familiarity with the application reviews under those designs over the past four years, combined with their integral role assisting in the entire review process up to preparation of Safety Evaluation Reports qualifies those organizations as the only contractors that can complete reviews related to the various design centers in a time-efficient manner. An award to any other commercial entity would result in duplication of cost to the NRC that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Further, the current scope of work creates an environment where potential bidders with little or no NRC licensing experience would further delay project schedules.

<DESC>USAID/Mexico will be launching a new program entitled the "Mexico Promoting Justice Project" (PROJUST). PROJUST aims to provide customized direct or indirect support at the state and federal level for the final push towards the 2016 reform deadlines, assisting selected Mexican states to pass the "point of no return" on their justice system reforms, and therefore contribute to broader USG and GOM efforts to mitigate conflict, reduce impunity, and promote a more transparent and efficient justice system.
<p>PROJUST contributes to and is supported under the Merida Initiative, an historic program of cooperation that acknowledges the shared responsibilities of the United States and Mexico to counter the drug-fueled violence that has threatened citizens on both sides of the border. Specifically, PROJUST contributes to the achievement of Pillar II of the Merida Initiative, which focuses on institutionalizing capacity to sustain rule of law. Within Pillar II, PROJUST will support comprehensive criminal justice reform that adheres to Mexican and international human rights standards implemented at state and federal levels. PROJUST will be the USAID flagship project to achieve the following results:</p>
<p>1) Legislative framework enacted for criminal justice reform; and <br />2) Strengthened institutional and human capacity to implement criminal justice reform.</p>
<p>A cost reimbursement completion contract, with a 5-year period, is contemplated. The expected start date for the program is o/a July 2013.</p>

The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.<br />b. The complexity of the project.<br />c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br />d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br />e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area.<br />f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br />g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br />h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.<br /><br />A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). <br /><br />Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: <br /><br />a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. <br /><br />b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will<br /><br />1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and <br /><br />2. Be consistent with law.<br /><br />Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.<br /><br /><strong>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:<br /><br /></strong>a. Should a PLA be executed on the above described Millennium Construction project at Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, VA? What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the Millennium Construction project?<br /><br />b. Will the use of a PLA be effective in achieving economy and efficiency? If so, how? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?<br /><br />c. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve?<br /><br />d. Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?<br /><br />e. This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?<br /><br />f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Are there large scale construction projects in the area (over $25M, within 50 miles of Arlington, VA) which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project?<br /><br />g. Is the proposed schedule/completion time one which would benefit from a PLA - if so, how? Will a PLA impact the completion time? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br /><br />h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?<br /><br />i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?<br /><br /><strong>Please provide your comments via e-mail to Debora Gray, Contract Specialist at Debora.s.gray@usace.army.mil no later than 2:00PM on 18 October 2012.<br /><br /></strong>This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey. </span></p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF SOLE SOURCE AWARD - CONTRACT # FA4418-13-P-0017<br />(In accordance with FAR 6.305)
<p><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of a sole source award under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1: Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br /><br />The Reference Number is FA4418-13-P-0017. The 628th Contracting Squadron, 101 E. Hill Blvd., Charleston AFB SC, awarded a contract for telephone service for Short Stay to Home Telephone Company of Moncks Corner, SC 29461-3949. Market research and information gathered determined this company to be the only source for this requirement.</p>
<p>The Justification for the Sole Source Award is as follows:<br /><br />In accordance with FAR 6.303-2:<br />(1) Agency and Activity: 628 Contracting Squadron, Joint Base Charleston, SC.<br /><br />(2) Nature of the action being approved: Sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>(3) The purpose of this acquisition is to provide telephone service for Short Stay.</p>
<p>(4) Justification Rationale: IAW FAR 6.302-1(a)(2): Only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work.</p>
<p>(5) Demonstration of Unique Qualifications: Home Telephone Company is the exclusive service provider in the area for leased local exchange access for commercial network service and outside infrastructure support at this location.</p>
<p>(6) Description of Solicitation Efforts: Local market research was performed, however Home Telephone Company has an exclusive agreement with the municipality. IAW FAR 5.201, this sole source notice will be posted on the Government-wide Point of Entry (FedBizOpps).</p>
<p>(7) The contracting officer has determined that the anticipated price to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on comparison of prices between vendors who provide similar services.</p>
<p>(8) Description of market research: GSA Advantage and SAM were queried to locate sources. While there are other sources who provide a similar service, there are none able to meet the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>(9) Other supporting facts: Due to the fact that Home Telephone Company has exclusive rights to the area, there are no other sources capable of providing the requirement.</p>
<p>(10) Interested Sources: Home Telephone Company was the only source that expressed interest in the requirement.</p>
<p>(11) Actions to prevent barriers that may lead to restricted consideration in the future: Continue monitoring the market for sources that may be able to meet the requirement in the future.</p>
<p>(12) This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to Idaho Technologies Inc., located at 390 Wakara Way, Salt Lake City, UT 84108, under the authority as prescribed in 10 USC 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The requirement is to develop Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) food and water (F&W) assay detection kits to support the JBAIDS analyzer.  Specifically, six F&W assays to detect and identify Salmonella spp., E-coli/O157:H7, Enterotoxigenix E.coli (ETEC), Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Shigella spp., are planned.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 541711 and the size standard is 500 employees.  In order to develop the new F&W pathogen surveillance assays, the contactor needs to have access to the JBAIDS design package (e.g. system integration drawings, prior polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay protocol hardware settings, JBAIDS software computer source code, and PCR hardware settings for the fielded 22 environmental and diagnostic assays, etc.) to develop and integrate new PCR F&W assays on the DoD JBAIDS fielded instruments.  Due to the unique qualifications and access to the required design source information, only the JBAIDS prime contractor, Idaho Technology Inc., has access to the JBAIDS data and is able to address this requirement.  A FEDBIZOPPS announcement (W911QY-12-S-0001) was released to industry on October 31, 2011.  The Government has considered the responses received in the decision to sole source this requirement. While this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, responsible parties purporting to have the necessary qualifications with the ability to develop these assays that will run on the JBAIDS system and who will not require access to the data, must submit official documentation to this fact within 15 days of this notice. Interested persons may identify their interest, in writing, to the Government point of contact.  Responses to this notice must be received no later than 4:00 PM, Eastern Standard Time, 7 Jun 2012.  The point of contact for this action is Sandra O'Connell, Sandra.oconnell@us.army.mil. NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE HONORED.

<a href="mailto:jillian.staskin@navy.mil">jillian.staskin@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>The Philadelphia Division, Contracting Department of NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source acquisition with only one source, Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), under the authority of FAR 6.302. 

This procurement is for the Design and development of a Sexual Assault Prevention & Response (SAPR) overview course for the Department of the Navy Sexual Assault Prevention & Response Office (DON SAPRO) that consists of 30-minutes of video and guided group discussion. The guided discussion portion will include multiple instructor guides to lead the discussion targeted specifically to applicable audiences.  H.R. 1540: National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2012 (FY12) requires this training to be developed no later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act.
 President Obama signed this Bill on Dec 31, 2011.

SAIC is uniquely equipped to deliver the service needed. This requirement seeks to leverage the effort SAIC has provided to both the Marine Corps and the Navy in their development of video-based SAPR training curriculum.  By taking advantage of the framework of the training and materials which have already been established for the Marine Corps and Navy CPPD training, including existing video footage of interviews with leadership (e.g. Chief of Naval Operations, Commandant of the Marine Corps, Director DON-SAPRO, etc.), we ensure a common delivery and appearance of training, reduce time spent in development, and reduced expenses.  Since the existing material with the CNO, ACMC, and other Navy leadership can be used for the SAPR video, the time and money spent to duplicate these efforts with another vendor would not be in the Governments best interest.
  

The proposed procurement is being processed as a sole source to SAIC.  The period of performance is 5 Sept 12 through 4 Sept 13, with two 12-month option periods.  A firm, fixed price contract will be issued and conducted in accordance with FAR 12.  The applicable NAICS code is 512110, Motion Picture and Video Production.

This notice is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
 The Government will not pay for the information received in response to this notice. Interested persons may contact Contract Specialist, Jillian Staskin, via email at jillian.staskin@navy.mil to identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. Such inquiries should refer to Control Number 2012-2494.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) announcement only. This is not a solicitation and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. Furthermore, the receipt of this RFI and or submission of a response confer no rights upon the vendor nor obligate the Government in any manner.<br />The Department of State's (DoS) Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations (CSO) is performing market research to determine small business interest and capabilities for providing support for its Professional Support and Experts (PS&amp;E) Acquisition Plan.
<p>This RFI is organized into the following sections:<br />1. Background<br />2. Objective<br />3. Contract Requirements<br />4. Instructions<br />5. Questions <br />6. Closing Date<br />7. Disclaimers<br />***************************************************************</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The U.S. Department of State (DoS), Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations (CSO) is planning a new acquisition initiative in support of its mission to strengthen U.S. national security by breaking cycles of violent conflict and mitigating crises in priority countries and supporting U.S. diplomacy by providing individual responders as needed to address overseas crises. The CSO Bureau maintains a professional staff composed of over 120 Foreign Service and Civil Service employees, augmented by over 50 contractor personnel performing a variety of administrative and professional support services. Personnel provided under this contract will support the operations of all CSO Offices. Personnel will provide basic support in the areas of bureau diplomacy, conflict analysis, planning, overseas response operations and other functional areas requiring contractor support. Work may also include collaboration with civilian and defense organization, including Department of Defense-Joint Forces Command (DOD-JFCOM), Combatant Commands (COCOMs), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and all other U.S. Government (USG) Agencies and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs). Contractor personnel working under this task may also work closely with all bureaus of the Department of State (regional and functional) and other inter-Agency offices as deemed necessary, and assist CSO in by providing expertise within CSO and provide surge capacity in support of CSO's mission.<br /><br />OBJECTIVE<br />The U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations (CSO) has a projected continuing requirement for long term professional staff and short term subject matter experts with experience in varying fields of operations on conflict prevention and stabilization and is seeking vendor(s) capable of providing contracting services. CSO has established specific objectives to be achieved through this consolidation of CSO professional and expert services including the following:<br />&bull; Reduce indirect costs by 35 to 75%% (fee, profit, and G&amp;A)<br />&bull; Reduce the overall CSO composite cost per labor hour by 15% to 25%<br />&bull; Reduce the number of CSO contract vehicles significantly by end of FY 2013<br />&bull; Reduce PALT (Procurement Administrative Lead Time) to two weeks<br />&bull; Develop meaningful incentives to reward superior performance in the field, and retain high quality professionals that provide services to CSO (awards, performance bonuses, etc.)<br />CSO requires that vendor(s) meet the criteria for small businesses described in Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 19.</p>
<p>A critical assumption in this plan is that personnel contracted by CSO are generally well known professionals in their field that CSO has found or dealt with previously. As CSO has completed many of the steps associated with finding, training, and supporting their contractors, the responsibilities of any potential prime contractor are greatly reduced. The Department of State and CSO expect offerors to be flexible in discounting previously negotiated rates, or building new forward pricing rates to reflect the current situation in which CSO performs the tasks associated with Personnel, Human Resources (HR), IT support, travel, security, office space, and virtually every aspect of engaging its manpower. CSO is seeking deep discounts in composite rates due to the burden it carries for identifying and fielding contractor personnel. Bidders should be prepared to waive or discount virtually all fees, general and administrative costs, and contribution to overhead normally associated with federal contracting. In the cases where CSO requires new personnel that consume prime contractor recruiting and HR, those costs shall be passed to CSO directly as a separate Contract Line Item (CLIN). The costs associated with finding new personnel for CSO shall only be billed once, in the first year of service.</p>

<DESC>Adversarial Modeling &amp; Exploitation Office<br />Request for Information (RFI): TASR Market Survey<br />Date: 10/03/12<br /><br />This is a request for information (RFI) issued by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) for information and planning purposes only. No awards will be made from the responses to this announcement. However, responses may be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for a future acquisition. This RFI is issued solely for market research, planning and information purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the government pay for information solicited hereunder. All information received will be treated as public knowledge. Any piece of proprietary or confidential information should be clearly marked.
<p><br />I. Purpose</p>
<p>Through this RFI document, the Adversarial Modeling &amp; Exploitation Office (AMX), US Naval Research Lab seeks to identify software systems for possible inclusion and integration in a suite of crime and threat analysis tools for the Federal Protective Service (FPS). Specifically, we are interested in software applications developed by U.S. personnel which could be utilized for crime analysis, spatial analysis, or intelligence analysis by the law enforcement community. Software systems could include, but not be limited to, those which are currently utilized by organizations including municipal police departments, county and state crime and intelligence analysis centers, and by Federal organizations.</p>
<p><br />II. Background<br /><br />The FPS provides policing and security services to nearly all Federal buildings in the United States. It has approximately 1,200 sworn personnel and oversees the efforts of approximately 12,000 armed security personnel. The FPS is responsible for not only protecting Federal property, but also Federal employees, and the immediate geographic area surrounding Federal property. FPS personnel are therefore responsible for assessing and responding to information and intelligence at the local, state, and federal level.</p>
<p>The Adversarial Modeling and Exploitation Office, US Naval Research Lab is involved in an ongoing project with the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&amp;T) to assist the FPS to more efficiently and effectively use information. This effort is known as the Threat Analysis Systems Requirement (TASR) project. Through the TSAR Project, we are seeking to develop a full threat and crime analysis system specification for the FPS. The goal of this project is to identify and later develop tools which will assist them to use available data more efficiently and effectively to deploy resources and protect against threats.</p>

<DESC>The Department of the Army, Healthcare Acquisition Activity- North intends to negotiate three Sole Source commercial item procurements for  Multiple Amputation Trauma Trainers for Ramstein AFB in Germany and two for Wright Patterson AFB. This procurement will  include liquid blood, Needle D Skin Plugs, Cric Skin, Manubrium Skin Plugs and training.  This proposed procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than October 10th, 2012  noon local time. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Point of contact Michele Devine, Contract Specialist, e-mail: michele.g.devine.ctr@us.army.mil <br><br>The following verbiage is directly from the Justification and Approval for sole source and is posted in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6).<br><br><br>K Force Government Solutions Inc., is the only vendor in the commercial market that offers this product. It was researched and developed under the Severe Trauma Simulation Army Technology Objective (ATO), TraumaFX was engineered specifically to meet the rigorous requirements of military and civilian training needs. Jointly developed with the U.S. Army RDECOM-ARL-STTC, TraumaFX MATT leverages in-depth human factors requirements analyses of military and civilian training needs to deliver powerfully realistic, yet easy to use training solutions that can be deployed to any location and operated in nearly any weather condition. <br>There is no other simulator on the market that provides this realistic, rugged, remote-control, tetherless training scenario complete with animatronics and special effects. Unlike other trainers, it can be worn by human actors and is compatible with other anthropomorphic trainers. The MATT has packable wounds, multiple tourniquet points, interchangeable priapism and scrotal avulsion and an upper torso that allows a multitude of procedures.  The animatronics give a degree of control to the instructor to advance a training scenario.  Students will learn how to find lifelike anatomical landmarks to execute critical patient treatment without relying on marked indicators. The sole source will avoid duplication of costs that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or the unacceptable delays due to the government.  The purchase of any other unit would reduce the training that the MATT is able to provide. <br><br>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally<br />determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer<br />has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is<br />not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. section 6212,<br />which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is<br />not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax<br />Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial<br />appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability,<br />and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. section 6320 entitling the taxpayer<br />to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further<br />appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the<br />hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer<br />has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it<br />is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final<br />tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. section<br />6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the<br />agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently<br />required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent<br />because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. section 362 (the Bankruptcy<br />Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The<br />Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (j)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are<br />included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor; unless<br />excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin<br />_______________ __________________<br />_______________ __________________<br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of<br />child labor.<br />(j) Place of Manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured<br />end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end<br />products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly--<br />(1) [ ] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products<br />manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured<br />outside the United States); or<br />(2) [ ] Outside the United States.<br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as<br />to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it<br />subcontracts out the exempt services.)<br />(1) [ ] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as 4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not<br />certify that-<br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than<br />Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an<br />exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business<br />operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or<br />market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such<br />equipment; and<br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work<br />under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees<br />servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.<br />(2) [ ] Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

POC: SSG Frank Perez, (760) 380-4472. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks have, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

(JUN 2006)
(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). 
(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<p>The level of effort anticipated under this contract will be provided within the terms of this contract at times mutually agreed to by DCHA/OFDA and the contractor. Upon identification of a temporary need within the scope of work, DCHA/OFDA will contact the contractor and provide the following information:</p>
<p>1.    Date contractor is needed to report to DCHA/OFDA or assignment in the field<br />2.    Duration of Assignment<br />3.    Place of Performance</p>
<p>The contractor will notify DCHA/OFDA within 24 hours of availability. At the time the contractor accepts the assignment, he/she is expected to commit for the duration of the assignment. While the contractor will be required to commit to a certain time period, it is understood that the exigencies of a disaster may require the assignment to be extended (not to exceed 250 days). The Contractor shall notify OFDA at the time of commitment if their existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment but will simply assist DCHA/OFDA in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if the contractor agrees to an extension of the duration of a particular assignment, thereafter, the contractor will be required to give DCHA/OFDA 10 days notice for release from the assignment.</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed. OPS performs these functions through several teams, namely, the Operations Support Team, the Overseas Administration Team, the Field Support Team and the Military Liaison Team (MLT).  The MLT provides technical assistance and guidance, military liaison and consequence management of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear or Explosive (CBRNE) events.  It also provides overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and to other sectors necessary to ensure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.  The Military Liaison Unit (MLU) is part of MLT and manages OPS liaison with the U.S. Military.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Program areas of common interest between USAID and the Department of Defense (DoD) include, but are not limited to, humanitarian assistance (disaster response), counter-terrorism, strategic communications, conflict prevention and mitigation, counter-insurgency, post-conflict reconstruction and stabilization, resiliency, and transformational development.  To ensure cohesion among policy goals and operational execution, USAID assigns Senior Development Advisors (SDAs) and OFDA Humanitarian Assistance Advisors/Military (HAA/Ms) to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Geographic Combatant Commands (GCCs), U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the Pentagon.</p>
<p>The USAID SDA serves as the principal USAID officer to the relevant Combatant Command (COCOM) and to the Pentagon, supporting the full spectrum of policies and activities across USAID's regional and functional bureaus and enabling and empowering the USAID perspective and operational priorities within DoD.  The OFDA HAA/M has the lead on coordinating disaster response activities for USAID within the COCOM area of responsibility and to the Pentagon and reports directly to the OFDA Director.</p>
<p>In all areas of activity, the SDA and HAA/M closely collaborate on their messaging to and activities with the GCCs, including sharing information and back-filling one another as necessary.  It is also a joint responsibility of the SDA and the HAA/M to keep one another informed of the other's activities.  The OFDA and USAID Office of Civilian-Military Cooperation (CMC) Directors, through OFDA's Military Liaison Team Leader and the CMC Plans Division Chief, prioritize and monitor close collaboration and coordination between their respective offices.  At all points, policy and operational guidance is coordinated with broader technical guidance from the relevant USAID bureau, office, and/or team.</p>
<p>The Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military (HAA/M) position was established to more effectively coordinate the activities of the MLU.  These activities include military liaison and coordination, deliberate planning, DART deployment, RMT participation and CBRNE disaster planning under Presidential Decision Directive 39/62.  The HAA/M will be located within the OPS's MLU and functions as the Division's principal point of contact with the DoD.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>HAA/Ms provide the critical liaison function between USAID and the DoD military establishment in order to represent the humanitarian sector perspective and expertise in situations where coordination between the parties is required.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

In DHHS, LIHEAP is administered by the Division of Energy Assistance within the Office of Community Services (OCS), which is a part of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF). The purpose of LIHEAP is to provide grants to LIHEAP grantees (States, Territories, and approximately 140 Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations) to assist low income households in meeting the costs of home energy. <br /><br />Section 2609A(a) of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 (title XXVI of Public Law 97-35, the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981, 42 U.S.C. 8621, as amended), authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to set aside up to $300,000 each fiscal year to make grants to State and public agencies and private nonprofit organizations; or to enter into contracts or jointly financed cooperative arrangements with States and public agencies and private nonprofit organizations, to provide training and technical assistance related to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).</p>

<p>The level of effort anticipated under this contract will be provided within the terms of this contract at times mutually agreed to by DCHA/OFDA and the contractor.

Subsequently, if the contractor agrees to an extension of the duration of a particular assignment, thereafter, the contractor will be required to give DCHA/OFDA 10 days notice for release from the assignment.</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed. OPS performs these functions through several teams, namely, the Operations Support Team, the Overseas Administration Team, the Field Support Team and the Military Liaison Team (MLT).  The MLT provides technical assistance and guidance, military liaison and consequence management of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear or Explosive (CBRNE) events.  It also provides overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and to other sectors necessary to ensure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.  The Military Liaison Unit (MLU) is part of MLT and manages OPS liaison with the U.S. Military.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Program areas of common interest between USAID and the Department of Defense (DoD) include, but are not limited to, humanitarian assistance (disaster response), counter-terrorism, strategic communications, conflict prevention and mitigation, counter-insurgency, post-conflict reconstruction and stabilization, resiliency, and transformational development.  To ensure cohesion among policy goals and operational execution, USAID assigns Senior Development Advisors (SDAs) and OFDA Humanitarian Assistance Advisors/Military (HAA/Ms) to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Geographic Combatant Commands (GCCs), U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the Pentagon.</p>
<p>The USAID SDA serves as the principal USAID officer to the relevant Combatant Command (COCOM) and to the Pentagon, supporting the full spectrum of policies and activities across USAID's regional and functional bureaus and enabling and empowering the USAID perspective and operational priorities within DoD.  The OFDA HAA/M has the lead on coordinating disaster response activities for USAID within the COCOM area of responsibility and to the Pentagon and reports directly to the OFDA Director.</p>
<p>In all areas of activity, the SDA and HAA/M closely collaborate on their messaging to and activities with the GCCs, including sharing information and back-filling one another as necessary.  It is also a joint responsibility of the SDA and the HAA/M to keep one another informed of the other's activities.  The OFDA and USAID Office of Civilian-Military Cooperation (CMC) Directors, through OFDA's Military Liaison Team Leader and the CMC Plans Division Chief, prioritize and monitor close collaboration and coordination between their respective offices.  At all points, policy and operational guidance is coordinated with broader technical guidance from the relevant USAID bureau, office, and/or team.</p>
<p>The Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military (HAA/M) position was established to more effectively coordinate the activities of the MLU.  These activities include military liaison and coordination, deliberate planning, DART deployment, RMT participation and CBRNE disaster planning under Presidential Decision Directive 39/62.  The HAA/M will be located within the OPS's MLU and functions as the Division's principal point of contact with the DoD.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>HAA/Ms provide the critical liaison function between USAID and the DoD military establishment in order to represent the humanitarian sector perspective and expertise in situations where coordination between the parties is required.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)<br />Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) Design Study Plan
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) and Special Operations Forces Directorate, ISR Sensors and Foreign Military Sales Division (AFLCMC/WIN), Contracting Offices 2530 Loop Road West, Rm 215, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7106, United States.</p>
<p>Request for Information: Airborne LIDAR Design Study Plan</p>
<p>Synopsis: Recent success with 3-Dimensional (3-D) LIDAR technology in Iraq and Afghanistan and the current maturity level of the technology indicate a need to investigate designs and a more definitive way-ahead for future Air Force airborne LIDAR capabilities. The Geospatial Intelligence Capabilities Working Group has initiated a study on the utility of airborne 3-D LIDAR in support of the Air Force ISR mission. The Air Force mission includes providing 3-D LIDAR data/products to several users within Department of Defense. The overall objective of this study is to identify potential materiel solutions, design concepts, key technologies, and cost/schedule/performance parameters for an enduring DoD LIDAR capability. Additionally, the Air Force is interested in the different types of products derived from airborne LIDAR data and how they could support or enhance Air Force operations. Air Force operations can include supporting DoD military and peacetime operations such as disaster relief and assessment.</p>
<p>Purpose: The intent of this RFI is to solicit information on airborne LIDAR technology and the capabilities of industry to produce LIDAR systems and products. Systems should meet the study operating conditions and performance requirements in support of both airborne tactical and strategic missions. This is a Sources Sought announcement only. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up request for information, if applicable.</p>
<p>Background: 3-D LIDAR systems and products are the primary focus for the study. System parameters either measured or calculated from current LIDAR sensors, which are of interest, include:<br />&bull; Size, weight, and power (SWaP) of the system<br />&bull; Operating range<br />&bull; Maximum slant angle as a function of altitude<br />&bull; Cross-range ground sampling distance<br />&bull; Range-precision<br />&bull; Collection rate and platform flight constraints<br />&bull; Visibility/atmospheric conditions (e.g., 20 km, mid-latitude summer atmospheric model)<br />&bull; Probability of detection against 10% Lambertian target<br />&bull; Intensity information (if measured)<br />&bull; Multiple return capability and range resolution (if appropriate)</p>
<p>A baseline assumption for the study was that any LIDAR concept would deliver the required performance mounted on the MQ-9 Reaper Remotely Piloted Aircraft for medium altitude missions, and on the RQ-4B Global Hawk, and/or the U-2 for high altitude missions. The system might be mounted in either a pod (preferred for the MQ-9 application) or in an internal configuration. For the high altitude missions, it should be noted that an internally- mounted sensor system is expected. It is anticipated that the LIDAR systems would be required to operate at the nominal altitudes and airspeeds at which these aircraft normally fly. For the purposes of this RFI, altitudes of 20,000 ft and 50,000 ft above ground level are of interest.</p>
<p>In addition to identifying the functional concepts or capabilities available within the industry, the Air Force is also interested in understanding the maturity of the technologies needed to support those concepts. For the purposes of this study, the focus is on mature/maturing technologies or operational capabilities that can meet Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL-6) within 24-36 months. However, the Air Force would also be interested in an assessment of technologies that require more than 36 months to reach TRL-6, but might provide improved performance, reduced SWaP, etc.</p>
<p>Responses: In responding to this RFI, interested parties are requested to submit a short, 3-5 page, white paper. The white paper should describe the LIDAR sensing mode or design that the offeror uses in the systems they produce, the experience the offeror has in producing those types of systems, and integrating them onto airborne platforms. The offeror is also requested to identify any less mature technology that could be further developed and how those technologies might impact the systems that the offeror produces. Responses should include known information regarding:</p>
<p>1. Operating range<br />2. System SWaP<br />3. Mission profile (open area imaging, mountainous terrain, heavily foliated terrain) <br />4. Flexibility in trading; <br />a. cross-range Ground Sample Distance (GSD) for coverage rate, and <br />b. collection rate for penetration through foliage of varying density and any procedures used to enhance &lsquo;below foliage' imagery (e.g. the stacking of multiple looks)<br />5. The size of raw data files and memory requirements for storing mission data (use a nominal 10 km2 frame size to estimate sizes) <br />6. On-board processing architectures for near real-time downlink of 1 km2 areas nominal GSDs of 20 cm.<br />7. Estimated cost and development/integration schedule</p>
<p>Interested, qualified sources are invited to respond to this Sources Sought announcement by submitting information as outlined below. Please do not submit a company brochure or other marketing material. Please submit the following information:</p>
<p>1. Professional qualifications of staff. Information shall document the staff's experience in the development and implementation of airborne 3-D LIDAR systems.<br />2. Specialized recent experience and technical competence of the firm in airborne 3-D LIDAR sensor and system development.<br />3. Information on your firm's ability to support the integration LIDAR systems onto an airborne platform and the use of LIDAR to collect 3-D data. Include project title, project description, dollar value, and a point of contact with phone number and email address.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the due date of responses. As such, responses to this market survey are now due no later than by 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on October 18, 2012.
=====================================================================
This announcement provides a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Market Survey for the Common Support Services (CSS) Infrastructure Solution. The purpose of this Market Survey is to (1) collect information about the market for cloud computing services; (2) identify potential approaches for meeting the CSS's cloud computing needs; (3) obtain vendors' comments and recommendations regarding the draft Descriptions of Potential Cloud Tenant Application; and (4) obtain additional industry insight regarding cloud computing. This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR OFFER (RFO). The FAA may or may not consider a solicitation. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.


I.	Background
The FAA is considering opportunities to use new technology and new service delivery models to improve the quality and efficiency of common support services. 
In order to obtain some operational efficiency at two data centers, the FAA has decided to migrate certain legacy systems (e.g. Weather Message Switching Center Replacement) to use common hardware, common user interfaces, common support tools and common documentation.  An Integrated Enterprise Service Platform (IESP) concept has been developed to support programs located at the NAS Enterprise Management Centers (NEMCs).  The IESP takes advantage of virtualization and in-house (organic) maintenance. The potential benefits of virtualization and in-house maintenance include decreased system complexity; centralized knowledge base and documentation; single maintenance and logistics philosophy; reduced training requirements and costs; increased scalability; and centralized monitoring.  
The FAA may be interested in a cloud-based solution for common support services (CSS) infrastructure in the operational domain. The FAA may consider using IaaS to host the operational CSS to be deployed in the National Airspace System (NAS). In the future, the CSS infrastructure could become a cloud service provider for other programs in the NAS. The FAA may also be open to evolving to other service models such as PaaS for CSS in the future. 


II.	Description
A CSS Infrastructure solution may host programs such as Common Support Services for Weather (CSS-Wx) and Aeronautical Information Management Modernization (AIMM), which will manage aviation weather and aeronautical information, respectively. 
The FAA considers the following as key objectives for cloud infrastructure: (1) Efficient use of hardware through resource pooling across multiple programs; (2) Efficient scalability to accommodate new programs, expanded programs, or additional users that are geographically dispersed; (3) Faster deployment of software and capabilities through standardization, interoperability, and potential IaaS; and (4) Ability to monitor, measure, and report program usage during initial deployment with an option to integrate this feature into back-end systems in order to charge programs for usage of the infrastructure.

Common Support Services for Weather (CSS-Wx)
CSS-Wx, formerly known as NextGen Network Enabled Weather (NNEW), will be part of a common support services capability. CSS-Wx will establish an aviation weather publishing capability for the NAS. It will enable access and the standardization of weather information for dissemination to users by System Wide Information Management (SWIM), a data management system the FAA is implementing for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). CSS-Wx will filter weather information geospatially and temporally to provide its service consumers only the specific data requested. Consumers of the information published by CSS-Wx will include air traffic control and traffic management systems users, commercial aviation, general aviation, and the flying public. CSS-Wx will also make weather information available for NextGen enhanced decision support tools. CSS-Wx will be the FAA's single provider of aviation weather data, consolidating several legacy weather information systems. CSS-Wx will also be scalable to facilitate the addition of new users and new systems. The system will be implemented over multiple work packages, and is scheduled to achieve initial operating capability in 2016. The CSS-Wx program may consider using a CSS Cloud to provide infrastructure services for processing capacity and storage.  

Aeronautical Information Management Modernization (AIMM)
The scope of the AIMM effort is divided into two segments and future work packages. AIMM Segment 1 (S1) focuses on improvements to the Central Altitude Reservation Function (CARF) and the Federal Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) System (FNS). The AIMM S1 system is not considered as a tenant application of a CSS Cloud. AIMM Segment 2 (S2) will expand user access to aeronautical information using SWIM infrastructure. AIMM S2 will make aeronautical information available to all NAS users through web-based, system-to-system interfaces and a web-based, human-to-system interface. Users will include the Department of Defense (DoD), air traffic control facilities, airlines, and general aviation. As part of AIMM S2, the information available through AIMM will be expanded to include Special Activity Airspace (SAA) and airport configuration data. AIMM S2 will also expand the distribution of NOTAMs through the FNS. The AIMM S2 program may consider using a CSS Cloud to provide infrastructure services for processing capacity and storage.

Security Challenges (27) The FAA's Cloud Computing Strategy (Attachment #3) identifies security challenges involved with providing cloud computing solutions in the NAS environment. NAS systems are all connected to the FTI network (Attachment #2), which has no direct connectivity to the Internet. All external communications to the NAS must traverse approved boundary protection systems, provided by the FAA (Attachment #2). Explain how these challenges could be overcome for a solution that meets the essential characteristics of cloud computing, as defined by NIST. (28) How would a cloud provider ensure proper application memory, storage, and network isolation between cloud tenants that have different application security levels? What are the elements of an effective approach to ensure information security in a shared environment (e.g., shared virtual hosts and shared system administrator)? (29) What are your thoughts on an effective approach to protect consumers' data against cloning, making snapshots, etc? What mechanisms could be used to monitor the movement of unauthorized data into and out of a private cloud? (30) How would a cloud provider mitigate performance and data latency issues introduced by security controls? (31) How would a cloud provider ensure security protocol interoperability with existing systems, such as those described in Attachment #2? (32) If you are currently providing cloud computing capability, what is the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) security classification for your cloud infrastructure?  Please describe your experience with FedRamp. (33) How would you address new security threats and new compliance requirements (e.g., threats that require security patches to the hypervisor)? (34) What are your thoughts on an effective approach to providing a centralized integrated management platform correlating system information from applications, systems and network infrastructure into a common operating picture for network and security operations?

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station intends to initiate a Request for Proposal (RFP) procurement action and award a Firm-Fixed Price contract for Airborne LiDAR and WASP Prescribed Fire Infrared Mapping Services. The Contractor shall provide equipment, labor, and materials necessary to accomplish the following tasks on Eglin Air Force Base (EAFB) in west Florida:
<p>1. Collect high density airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data pre- and post-fire over a collection of units scheduled for burning in November 2012. <br />2. Collect high density LiDAR on unit 307B adjacent to the burn units (pre- OR post-fire).<br />3. Map active-fire infrared heat release on all but one of the units in #1 using the WASP instrument (Wildfire Airborne Sensing Platform) maintained and operated by Rochester Institute of Technology. <br />4. Collect high density LiDAR of 25 small, non-contiguous experimental plots in longleaf pine savanna located on the western side of EAFB.</p>
<p>The acquisition will be solicited using the procurement process prescribed in Part 12, Commercial Items, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). A Firm-Fixed-Price contract will be awarded for a Base Period, and one (1) Option Period (if exercised) and will be from approximately November 2012 to September 2014. The Government will award the contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, will be the Best Value to the Government. The award may be made to a superior offeror which is not the lowest offered price, but which is significantly more technically advantageous than the lowest offer so as to justify the payment of a higher price. Proposals will be reviewed for completeness and evaluated for acceptability against the following evaluation factors listed in descending order of importance: 1) Experience and Qualifications of Contractor Key Personnel [and Subcontractors, if applicable]; 2) Past Performance and 3) Price Reasonableness. Factors 1 and 2 are of equal weighting and are significantly more important than price; however price will contribute substantially to the selection decision. Award of the contract will be made as a whole to the offeror whose proposal conforms to all requirements of the specifications and is the "greatest value" to the Government, cost and other factors considered. The Government may elect to conduct discussions with offerors whose proposals are technically acceptable (or which may be expected to be made acceptable by moderate modification) and fall within the competitive price range. The Government reserves the right, however, to award a contract based on initial offers without conducting discussions. Therefore, each proposal should be submitted from the offeror's most favorable technical and price standpoints.</p>
<p>Solicitation documents, plans and specifications will only be available via the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) homepage located at https://www.fbo.gov/ An electronic copy of Solicitation Number AG-3604-S-12-0039 will be posted on this site on or about September 14, 2012. No hard copies will be issued and no written or fax requests will be accepted. Proposals are due on or about October 4, 2012 by 11:00 am EST. Proposals may be e-mailed to Maria T.

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station intends to initiate a Request for Proposal (RFP) procurement action and award a Firm-Fixed Price contract for Airborne LiDAR and WASP Prescribed Fire Infrared Mapping Services. The Contractor shall provide equipment, labor, and materials necessary to accomplish the following tasks on Eglin Air Force Base (EAFB) in west Florida:
<p>1. Collect high density airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data pre- and post-fire over a collection of units scheduled for burning in November 2012. <br />2. Collect high density LiDAR on unit 307B adjacent to the burn units (pre- OR post-fire).<br />3. Map active-fire infrared heat release on all but one of the units in #1 using the WASP instrument (Wildfire Airborne Sensing Platform) maintained and operated by Rochester Institute of Technology. <br />4. Collect high density LiDAR of 25 small, non-contiguous experimental plots in longleaf pine savanna located on the western side of EAFB.</p>
<p>The acquisition will be solicited using the procurement process prescribed in Part 12, Commercial Items, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). A Firm-Fixed-Price contract will be awarded for a Base Period, and one (1) Option Period (if exercised) and will be from approximately November 2012 to September 2014. The Government will award the contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, will be the Best Value to the Government. The award may be made to a superior offeror which is not the lowest offered price, but which is significantly more technically advantageous than the lowest offer so as to justify the payment of a higher price. Proposals will be reviewed for completeness and evaluated for acceptability against the following evaluation factors listed in descending order of importance: 1) Experience and Qualifications of Contractor Key Personnel [and Subcontractors, if applicable]; 2) Past Performance and 3) Price Reasonableness. Factors 1 and 2 are of equal weighting and are significantly more important than price; however price will contribute substantially to the selection decision. Award of the contract&nbsp;may be made to one contractor as a whole; or to two (2) separate contractors based on the lowest aggregate cost to the Government to the offeror whose proposal conforms to all requirements of the specifications and is the "greatest value" to the Government, cost and other factors considered. The Government may elect to conduct discussions with offerors whose proposals are technically acceptable (or which may be expected to be made acceptable by moderate modification) and fall within the competitive price range. The Government reserves the right, however, to award a contract based on initial offers without conducting discussions. Therefore, each proposal should be submitted from the offeror's most favorable technical and price standpoints.</p>
<p>Solicitation documents, plans and specifications will only be available via the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) homepage located at https://www.fbo.gov/ An electronic copy of Solicitation Number AG-3604-S-12-0039 will be posted on this site on or about September 14, 2012. No hard copies will be issued and no written or fax requests will be accepted. Proposals are due on or about October 4, 2012 by 11:00 am EST. Proposals may be e-mailed to Maria T. Evans at the following e-mail address: mtevans@fs.fed.us Proposals may also be sent by mail to the USDA Forest Service - Northern Research Station, 11 Campus Blvd., Suite 200, Newtown Square, PA 19073, ATTN: Maria T. Evans.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this project is 541360 with a size standard of $14 Million. It is the contractor's responsibility to monitor FBO for any amendments. All contractors must be registered in the System For Award Management (SAM) [previously Central Contractor Registration (CCR)] database at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ as required by FAR 4.1102. Also, contractors who receive a federal contract of $25,000.00 or more are required by legislation to submit an annual VETS-100 Report on your employment of targeted veterans.

Identification of Statutory Authority (FAR 6.303-2(a)(4)).<br />10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1. The services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy the Agency requirements. <br />5. Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications (FAR 6.303-2(a)(5)).<br />a. Only one responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)) <br />(1) FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) states, <br />"When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for." <br />(2) The named vendor is the producer of a proprietary method for sequencing DNA samples. The cost of DNA sequencing has dropped dramatically in just the last few years and new methods that take advantage of this reduced cost in the genotyping of samples by direct sequencing of genomic DNA have become available. A novel method developed at Cornell University by Drs. Sun Schweitzer and Buckler, incorporates a step for genomic complexity reduction (restriction digestion) plus that ligation of molecularly bar-coded samples to effectively sequence 96 samples simultaneously on one flow cell of the Illumina Genome Analyzer. This method has not been made publicly available and is not provided by other laboratories offering DNA sequencing services. Similarly, a bioinformatics pipeline has been established at Cornell University for the processing of the raw data generated through this unique method. Additionally, the research of these two research Units requires the sequencing to be processed through the same vendor as previous experiments so that data results will be consistent and can be comparatively analyzed<br />6. Federal Business Opportunities - FedBizOpps.gov (FBO) Announcement/Potential Sources (FAR 6.303-2(a)(6).<br />a. A Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) synopsis is published in an attempt to identify other possible vendors of the required consumable.<br />b. USDA/ARS does not anticipate other qualified sources; however, should any responses be received, they will be evaluated to determine if they can meet future needs of the Government.<br />7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost (FAR 6.303-2(a)(7).<br />The cost was determined to be fair and reasonable with this sequencing service. However, this cost could not be directly compared to other companies' offers because no other company provides identical sample processing and bioinformatic analysis. <br />8. Description of Market Research (FAR6.303-2 (a)(8).<br />USDA/ARS is constantly surveying the market and from this experience knows that the consumable is proprietary and only available from the vendor identified. <br />9. Any Other Supporting Facts (FAR 6.303-2(a)(9))<br />Due to the proprietary nature of the item needed to perform the research, at this time there is only one source available. <br />10. Listing of Interested Sources (FAR 6.303-2(a)(10).<br />No other sources are available at this time.<br />11. Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition (FAR 6.303(a)(11)).<br />Vendor surveys are done from time to time to see if other existing items can meet the research requirements. Scientists have tested other similar products but no similar results can be guaranteed.<br />12. Technical Requirements and Certifications; (FAR 6.303-1(b) and FAR 6.303-2(b)<br />I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification are complete and accurate.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION: (FAR 6.303-1(A), 6.303-2(A)(12)<br />I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

<AWARDEE>Bara Inforware, Inc., 2678 Bishop Drive - Suite 116, San Ramon, CA 94583 US
<DESC><br />The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has issued one (1) labor hours type contract to Bara Infoware, Inc. for FOIA Support Services for one base year and 4 option years for a total period of performance of up to five (5) years. The place of performance will be at the NTSB Headquarters location at 490 L'Enfant Plaza East, SW, Washington, DC 20594.<br /><br />The solicitation was issued and competed as a total small business set aside. Use of a labor hours-type contract is recommended because, through market research, and the evaluation of proposals, the NTSB has identified that Contractors are currently performing work of a similar nature and only labor is required from the Contractor to perform the contract.  It is not possible at the time of placing the contract to accurately estimate the exact extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of certainty beyond the estimated level of efforts and price ceiling described in the contract. A firm-fixed price contract type places upon the contractor maximum risk and full responsibility for all costs and resulting profit or loss, and therefore would lead to greater costs being paid by the Government. Under a labor hours type contract, the Government shall only be charged the actual hours incurred by the contractor in the performance of work under the contract.  Therefore a labor hours type contract has been determined to be the contract type that provides the best value  to the Government.

, East Hartford, CT 06108 US
<DESC>Pratt &amp; Whitney is the original designer, developer, and manufacturer of the F135 propulsion system and is the only source with the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical expertise to produce the F135 propulsion system at the required ramp rate and within the required delivery schedule. P&amp;W is the only source with the facilities and capabilities required to provide the F135 propulsion system and associated sustainment support for the LRIP Lot 7 requirements. All prior F135 propulsion system contracts for use in the F-35 Air System have been awarded to P&amp;W on a sole-source basis, pursuant to the F-35 Lightning II JSF Acquisition Strategy, approved on 5 December 2008 by the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics), which designated P&amp;W as the sole source to provide the F135 Propulsion System for use in the F-35 Air System.
<p>Pursuant to the F-35 Lightning II JSF Acquisition Strategy, the Government did explore the possibility of two interchangeable propulsion systems, the P&amp;W F135 propulsion system and the GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team (FET) F136 propulsion system. The FET was awarded a F136 Systems Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract in 2005. However, in Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 through FY 2011, the FET F136 propulsion system was not included in the Department of Defense Budget. Congress nevertheless provided funding in FY 2007 through FY 2010 for development of the FET F136 propulsion system. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (Public Law 112-10) enacted on 15 April 2011 did not provide funds for the continued development of the FET F136 propulsion system. On 25 April 2011, the FET F136 SDD contract was terminated for the convenience of the Government. At this point in FY 2012, which is the long-lead advance procurement year for LRIP Lot 7, the FET is not a viable source for LRIP Lot 7 propulsion requirements. For the reasons cited above, P&amp;W is the only source currently capable of producing and sustaining propulsion systems for LRIP Lot 7.</p>
<p>As a result of the FET F136 SDD contract termination, the competition opportunities envisioned in the F-35 Lightning II JSF Acquisition Strategy are not available. The F-35 Lightning II JSF Acquisition Strategy to promote competition was to explore the possibility of two interchangeable propulsion systems, and therefore did not require the purchase of technical data packages for both or either of the F135 propulsion system or F136 propulsion system. As a result, the Government does not have technical data packages suitable for full and open competition of propulsion system efforts for LRIP Lot 7.</p>
<p>The contract type is fixed price incentive (firm target) for the install F135 propulsion systems, of which long lead-time materials were purchased under the Advance Acquisition Contract. Per FAR 16.403(b), a FPI (firm target) contract type is suitable for these efforts because the nature of the supplies or services being acquired and other circumstances of the acquisition are such that the contractor's assumption of a degree of cost responsibility will provide a positive profit incentive for effective cost control and performance.</p>

<DESC>This procurement is for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for A&E Services for preparation of Navy and Marine Corps Basic Facility Requirements (BFR) and Asset Evaluations (AE).

The primary geographic area covered by this contract encompasses the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Atlantics (NAVFAC Atlantic) area of responsibility (AOR) and the adjacent waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, including the Continental United States (CONUS), the Caribbean, Europe and North Africa.  However, tasks associated with this contract may be assigned anywhere in the world.  The IDIQ contract term shall be for a one (1) year period, beginning at date of award, and shall contain four (4) one year option periods.
  The maximum combined amount that may be paid under the contract (including option years) will not exceed $15,000,000.  

	The primary tasks anticipated under this contract include developing Basic Facility Requirements (BFR) documents and performing Asset Evaluations.   Basic Facility Requirements (BFR) are developed to determine what facilities are required to perform the assigned mission. The contractor will calculate BFR by Category Code, Special Area, and Host and its tenants for each site. BFR are the result of an analysis of projected mission and base/tenant loading, operational considerations, activity and surrounding community conditions, and sound professional judgment. BFR are intended to be the minimum facilities necessary for efficient operation and are not directly constrained by anticipated funding levels, individual operational priorities or inefficiencies in existing facilities.
 An Asset Evaluation (AE) is an on-site inspection of an Activitys buildings and structures that is performed jointly by the contractor and the activity. During an AE, existing facilities are inspected to verify current occupancy, floor areas and usage, and to assess their ability to satisfy designated present uses.  Data will include photos of buildings.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  The Hines VA Hospital has a need for calibration, preventative maintenance and service of the DA Vinci Surgical Robotic System that is utilized in direct patient care to assist in performing the least invasive surgical procedures for the veteran. The robotic system is used to treat conditions ranging from different types of cancer to obesity. Failure to have the robotic operating correctly can cause death during procedures. The services will be for the period of 10/1/12 - 9/30/12 at a total cost of $165,000.00 yearly. 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	(X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	
5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   The DA Vinci System is a CE marked and FDA cleared piece of equipment that allows surgeons to remotely pilot this equipment through a surgical procedure. The DA Vinci System is manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, Inc which owns all property rights to the system and is the only authorized service provider of the system. Intuitive Surgical has specially trained engineers that have exclusive access to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts and are capable of working on complex robotic surgical systems. OEM parts are not available from other companies.
 
6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  The DA Vinci Robotic System consists of proprietary operating system software, and is the sole authorized provider of services. The system is so specialized that it prohibits other manufacturers from supplying parts. No other offers were solicited.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The Contracting Officer contacted Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Service Contract Division, 1-877-408-3872 x4 for pricing comparison. The price on the quote $165,000 is the government discount pricing. The regular catalog price is $174,000 yearly. Given the discount price, the Contracting Officer has determined the final contract price to be fair and reasonable. 
8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  No other market research was conducted due to proprietary equipment and operating software from the manufacturer.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  No action was taken to foster competition for future acquisitions. The proprietary rights prohibit other vendors from servicing the Robotic System.

Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO)20, 8115 NE 82nd Ave. Vancouver WA. This requirement will be procured for the Spokane VA Medical Center. The Contract Specialist for this procurement is Philip Cyphers.

2.	Nature of the Action Being Processed:  

IAW FAR 6.001(a), acquisitions conducted under FAR 13 for SAP are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2, IAW the VHA SOP for Other than Full and Open Competition dated 3-22-2011. The 2237 number for this procurement is 668-12-4-5057-0464 and the purchase order number is VA260-12-P-2665. The Department of Veterans Affairs proposes to enter into a contract on the basis of other than full and open competition for the purchase of repairs to the compressor at the Spokane VA. The requirement will consist of repairs to compressor at the Spokane VA, which will include the recovery of refrigerant, leak test, pressure test and evacuate. Also, the installation of new filter driers and charge circuits will be completed. Lastly, replacing leaking caps, tightening packings, and installing flare gaskets as needed. This is a new procurement and the contract contemplated will be firm fixed price to Air Dixon a small business. This is a critical emergency requirement.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  

The 2237 number for this procurement is 668-12-4-5057-0464 and the purchase order number is VA260-12-P-2665. The procurement is for an emergency compressor repair of the Spokane VA. The compressors provide cold air to the IT server room. If the compressors fail, the server room will need to be shut down and all computer services for the medical center, CBOCs, and lease space will be unavailable. The estimated value of the procurement is $6,120. This is a critical emergency requirement and the estimated delivery date is September 21, 2012. 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

Statutory Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c), or 38 U.S.C. 8153 as implemented by FAR 6.302.  

	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

The contract, Air Dixon a small business, is a local service repair representative in the Spokane WA. Dennis Shea, of the VA engineering department, has used Air Dixon in the past for needed repair. The repairs Air Dixon has made are listed as order numbers 668-P21487, 668-P21356, 668-A00275 and 668-C70083. Thus, making Air Dixon knowledgeable about the VA Spokane engineering infrastructure and is the preferred vendor for this procurement. If another vendor was used they would, most likely, not be family with the VA Spokane engineering infrastructure, which would result in higher repair cost and longer repair times. Therefore, in order to complete the repairs by September 21, 2012 and on budget, Air Dixon was selected as the appropriate vendor. Lastly, due to the critical nature of this emergency order, only one small business vendor was contacted.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

Under normal circumstances this procurement would fall under usual requirements for open market competition and be open by any and all eligible contractors. There may be other vendors that could possibly provide repairs to the compressor, however, as stated in paragraphs four and five due to the critical nature of this procurement and in order to complete the repairs by September 21, 2012 and on budget Air Dixon is the necessary choice. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

The anticipated total cost of the repair to the compressor at the Spokane VA is $ 6,120.00. Past purchases include 668-P21487, 668-P21356, 668-A00275 and 668-C70083. IAW FAR 13.106-3(a)(2)(ii) comparison with previous purchases (as listed previously), I determine that the quote from Air Dixon is fair and reasonable.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

FAR Part 10 directs that market research be conducted on each acquisition appropriate to the circumstances. Market research was conducted for this procurement and mandatory sources where queried in order of priority, see market research in the briefcase. Research results serve to confirm, due to the urgent and compelling nature of this procurement, that Air Dixon is the necessary choice and the only small business contacted. See paragraphs four and five for a complete explanation of the critical nature of this requirement. 

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:

Another reason for supporting other than full and open competition is without a working compressor the Spokane VA would need to shut down their server room as stated in paragraph three and on the 2237 request. Many of the patient care is tied to access to a computer network, the Spokane VA would be forced to resort to a non-computer based patient care system. This would negatively impact the patient care at the Spokane VA and setting up a non-computer based patient support system would come with an initialization, training and administration cost. Also, in many cases, it is reasonable to assume that patients would go without needed care. The specific reason for restricting competition is the urgent and compelling nature of this procurement. 

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  

An open market small business SBA search was preformed, since the repairs are not available from a mandatory source. The results using keyword repair, NAICS code 238220 and limiting the search to the Spokane area code 509, five small businesses were found who could perform similar items. See P02 - MARKET RESEARCH - SBA in the briefcase of this order. Unfortunately, due to the nature of this critical procurement only Air Dixon was contacted. See paragraphs four and five for a complete explanation on vendor selection. 

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  

Market research is still ongoing for an alternate vendor who could be used and become familiar with the engineering infrastructure of the Spokane VA and to be able to properly fix the compressor during critical situations in a timely and cost effective manner. At this point five suitable small business vendors have been found using an SBA search, see paragraph 10. It would be in the best interest of NCO 20 to work toward a contractual instrument that will facilitate timely effective emergency repairs for compressors for all stations within NCO 20. This agreement would be arrived at on a competitive basis. 
 

12.	Requirements Certification:  

I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC><br />RQ No.: 40000-12-0157 and<br />27000-12-8011<br />J&amp;A Log No: 2012: 0123<br />JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p><br />Upon the basis of the following justification, I hereby approve the issuance of the contractual action discussed below using other than full and open competition, pursuant to the authority cited herein.</p>
<p>1. Contracting Activity. <br />U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission<br />100 F Street, NE<br />Washington, DC 20549</p>
<p>2. Nature and Description of Action Being Approved:<br />The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)intends to award a sole source requirement to Iron Mountain Information Management, Inc. (Iron Mountain), 1000 Campus Drive, Collegeville, PA 19426, for records management and digital archives. This is a follow-on bridge contract action for the period of nine (9) months.</p>
<p>3. Description of the supplies or services required to meet the needs of the SEC and the estimated value: <br />The requirement is for records management and digital archives services to Iron Mountain Information Management, Inc., which has provided such services since 2005 under GSA Contract, GS-25F-0066M, Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA), for SECHQ1-05-A-0136-0008 and SECHQ1-05-A-01360009. The records management and digital archives services are provided by Iron Mountain to the SEC's Headquarters Office, Washington, DC, and Regional Offices located in: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Ft. Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Salt Lake, and San Francisco.</p>
<p>The period of performance for the bridge contract will be for 9 months from September 28, 2012 through June 28, 2013, along with a three month option period. This amount of time is necessary to provide ample time for procurement and transition before a new contract vehicle is in place.</p>
<p>The estimated contract value for the nine month base period is $347,802 for the SECHQ1-05-A-0136-0008 follow-on and $7,500 for the SECHQ1-05-A-0136-0009 follow-on; both follow-on contracts will use FY12 funds. The total value of all actions under this J&amp;A may not exceed $491,000.00.</p>
<p>4. Statutory Authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition:<br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. Section 3304(a)(2) FAR 6.302-(2) - Unusual and compelling urgency.</p>
<p>5. Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:<br />Iron Mountain Information Management Inc. is the current vendor of record under GSA Schedule Contract Number GS-25F-0066M and it currently provides records management and digital archives services for the SEC records. Iron Mountain offers full services for records storage including retrieval, transportation, and processing of records. The Contractor provides media storage in a climate controlled environment, National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) compliant storage, general warehousing and storage, libraries and archives, custom computer facilities records storage, and, physical distribution and logistics consulting services. The follow-on bridge contract(s) will be commercial contracts and not GSA Delivery or Blanket Purchaser Orders. This requirement is an interim measure until a permanent contract vehicle is in place. It is being limited to Iron Mountain because excessive delay and costs would be incurred if the SEC were to consider going with other vendors at this time. Iron Mountain currently stores 202,235 cubic feet of records and it would not be possible to have all records transferred and immediately available at another vendor location. <br /><br />6. Efforts to Ensure that offers are solicited from as Many Potential Sources as Possible.<br />This requirement will be transmitted through approved Government Points of Entry (GPE) concurrent with a joint solicitation/synopsis of the requirement.</p>
<p><br />7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. <br />The Contracting Officer certifies that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on commercial pricing.</p>
<p>8. Description of a market survey conducted and results or statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted:<br />Various SEC records and digital archives inventory are currently in storage with Iron Mountain. <br /><br />A separate market survey was not conducted for this procurement as there would be excessive costs and undue delay if other vendors aside from Iron Mountain were considered at this time for these storage services. This is a temporary, interim measure until after a solicitation is released as intended under a General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) competition among eligible GSA FSS contractors. It is anticipated that the solicitation would occur between October 1, 2012 and June 28, 2013. <br /><br />9. Other Supporting Facts:<br />N/A<br /><br />10. A listing of the sources, if any that expressed, in writing an interest in the acquisition:<br />All responses received as a result of the solicitation published for this requirement will be considered in determining whether the J&amp;A is applicable or should be revisited. Any such responses and resolution will be placed in the award file.</p>
<p>11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:<br />The Commission's information and records storage requirements are ongoing and future acquisitions of similar services will be advertised.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


1.  Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) for Other Than Full and Open Competition is executed by the Acquisition Services - Frederick (AS-F), MD, on behalf of Human Resources and Administration (HR&A), Office of Administration (OA), Human Resource Management (HRM).


2.  Nature/Description of Action.

This activity proposes to negotiate a noncompetitive award (sole source) with Pomerantz Acquisition Corp. ("Pomerantz"), a Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), for the procurement of workplace modification services for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  Pomerantz is a registered and verified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) in VetBiz.gov. 
Pomerantz is an authorized distributor and installer of Steelcase brand products. Steelcase brand products are required for the following reason:  The 810 Vermont Avenue (VACO) building was renovated in the early 1990s.  This project would require the Steelcase product in order to be able to reuse the electrical, hardware, and office furniture that already exists in order to save money and maintain the aesthetics of the 810 Vermont building.  

Refurbishing, cleaning, touch up, etc. of existing Steelcase product is included in this scope of work and can only be done by Steelcase or an authorized Steelcase dealer in order to maintain warranty of the product and avoid any additional costs to the government.


3.  Description of Supplies/Services.

The objective of this contract is to obtain professional services in supporting HR&A OA.

OA requires support services to field survey, quote new product needed to complete the design, disassemble, remove, refurbish portions of, store, re/install, and dispose of excess furniture in two areas of their office space located at 810 Vermont Avenue, VA Central Office (VACO) as specified in the scope of work and design intent drawings.  

The space is undergoing reconstruction, allowing for more personnel to fit in the areas.  This is part of an effort to reduce the hoteling space required by VA, thus reducing expenses long term.
 
The total estimated maximum value of this requirement is $ 329,969.90.  There are no option year periods for such contract. 


4.  Identification of Statutory Authority.

The statutory exception permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5), Authorized or Required by Statute as implemented by FAR 6.302-5.  Sole Source Awards are permitted under the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. 657f).

The applicable statute is Public Law 109-461, Veterans First Contracting Program.

A Sole Source Contract is permitted to a VOSB if no responsible SDVOSB concern is identified.  See VAAR 819.7007 and 819.7008.  The Market Research conducted by Program Office did identify a verified SDVOSB business which could perform all of the requirements.


5.  Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications.
Pomerantz is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) registered and verified in VetBiz under the applicable NAICS code, 423420.   Pomerantz has completed numerous task orders for central office including redesigns, repairs, small purchases; i.e., keyboard trays, conference tables, seating, etc., and have done so to the government's satisfaction.  Pomerantz is also an acknowledged Steelcase dealer protecting the warranty the government has on existing product in the 810 Vermont Avenue building.   Further, Pomerantz is currently providing these services under a competitive GSA task order.  By using the building standard furniture, Steelcase, the government will be able to reuse existing product, electrical and hardware to save money on this particular project, but also on any future redesigns and changes because the parts, finishes, etc. are workable on this standard manufacturer.  If we procured another furniture line that would not be the case and would cost the government additional funding in order to match the furniture line and complete requirements.  For example, seating of the area is being reused saving the government the purchase of approximately 40 chairs, if the government went with another line of furniture it would be required to purchase the chairs at an estimated $550 per chair for an additional $22,000. 

6.  Description of efforts made to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable.

A notice of intent to sole source will be posted in the Federal Business Opportunity System pursuant to the Federal Register Vol. 74, No. 234 (Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Acquisition Regulation Supporting Veteran-Owned and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses) Final Rule # 5.  

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Prices.

No award shall be made until the Contracting Officer determines the costs to the Government to be fair and reasonable.  This determination will be based on sources such as comparison of other contracts for same or similar services, the GSA, the contractor's public price list, and Internet Search Engines.



8.  Description of Market Survey.

Market research was conducted using GSA schedules, information for vendors that are reputable distributors of the manufacturer's (Steelcase) product, andVetBiz.gov.  We determined that Pomerantz is a responsible source with respect to this contracting opportunity.  They are registered and verified in VetBiz.gov as an SDVOSB with the NAICS Code Number(s) 423420 for this requirement, which in accordance with Public Law 109-461 Section 502(c) meets the requirements of this statute to sole source to an SDVOSB.

The NIACS Code 423420 is for Office Equipment Merchant Wholesalers.


9.  Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.

PL109-461 Section 502(c) states:

SOLE SOURCE CONTRACTS FOR CONTRACTS ABOVE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION THRESHOLD.  For purposes of meeting the goals under subsection (a), and in accordance with this section, a Contracting Officer of the Department may award a contract to a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans using procedures other than competitive procedures if:

(1)	Such concern is determined to be a responsible source with respect to performance of such contract opportunity;

(2)	The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 4 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403)) but will not exceed $5,000,000; and

(3)	In the estimation of the contracting officer, the contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States.

This procurement meets all of these conditions. By using the building standard furniture, Steelcase, the government will be able to reuse existing product, electrical and hardware to save money on this particular project, but also on any future redesigns and changes because the parts, finishes, etc. are workable on this standard manufacturer.   As noted above, Pomerantz has been determined to be a capable and verified SDVOSB. Pomerantz will be determined responsible prior to contract award, following (1) above and in accordance with FAR 9.104. The award price is anticipated to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, but will not exceed $5,000,000 following (2) above. The Contracting Officer anticipates contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers the best value to the Government, following (3) above. As noted, award will not be made until the quoted price is determined fair and reasonable.   



10.  Listing of Interested Sources.
Pomerantz Acquisition Corp. 
123 S. Broad Street
Philadelphia, PA 19109-1029

11.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition.

All future requirements will be handled on a case-by-case basis and market research will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 10.

<AWDNBR>VA101-12-C-0032
<AWDDATE>092712
<ARCHDATE>10272012
<DESC>Pursuant to the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.3 and in accordance with the requirements of FAR 6.303-1, this justification for the use of the statutory authority under FAR Subpart 6.3 is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR 6.303-2 as follows: 
1.	Contracting Activity 
Department of Veterans Affairs 
Office of Acquisition Operations 
Acquisition Business Service (003B5) 
1776 I St. NW 
Washington, DC 20006 

2.		Nature of Action Being Approved:  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), 
Office of Security and Law Enforcement has a critical need to enter into a 
noncompetitive award with the Information Justice and Public Safety Information 
Sharing Network, formerly known as the National Law Enforcement 
Telecommunications System (Nlets).   This justification and approval sets forth the 
relevant facts and requests approval for the award of a one (1) year base contract with 
four (4) one year option periods. 

3.		Description of Services:  VA Office of Security and Law Enforcement has an 
annual requirement for uninterrupted access to Nlets.  This access is granted through
annual payment of membership fees, which this acquisition seeks to secure.  Nlets is a 
501(c)(3) not for profit corporation, partially funded by membership fees.  Nlets is 
primarily a message switch that electronically links state, territory, local, Federal and 
international entities involved in law enforcement, criminal justice, and public safety.  Its 
purpose is to provide the capability to access and exchange the information transmitted
through its message switch.  In addition to state criminal history and driver and vehicle 
information, other files are available such as parole, probation, and corrections, bulk 
cash transactions, state wants and warrants, concealed weapons, license plate reader, 
immigration, social security, national insurance crime, hazardous material, and many 
others to include Interpol, Canadian, and Mexican files. 

In order to sustain continuous access to the system, Nlets charges an annual membership fee to all its members, state and Federal.  The Office of Security and Law Enforcement is the policy oversight and compliance organization for the majority of VA Nlets users, i.e., VA Police.  As such, it is centrally billed by Nlets in the form of a consolidated base and terminal fee that ensures VA-wide access. 
The fee structure is composed of the following: 
"	A "membership base fee" ($4000.00 per month) is assessed universally for each month of access, to both state and Federal members. 
"	Supplementing the membership base fee, a terminal fee is charged based on the number of "terminal" or access points utilized by the agency. Nlets mandates that 
each Federal agency with more than 50 individual access points is assessed this additional fee based on the number of access points it utilizes. 
VA accesses Nlets by means of the following separate means: 
"	VA Police Units, which comprise the majority of VA users, have access to Nlets though stationary, mobile, and web access points. These users access Nlets through their designated state or Department of Justice system message switches/interfaces which directly link to the Nlets switch. This procurement will specifically ensure that their access to the Nlets switch is procured and maintained via fulfilling payment of the membership fee. 
"	The Office of Security and Law Enforcement accesses Nlets through its one terminal in VA Central Office through the DoJ JUST switch/interface which is directly linked to Nlets. 
"	The VA Office of Inspector General accesses Nlets through approximately 10 stationary terminals throughout the U.S. and VA Central Office which access Nlets applications through the DoJ JUST system switch/interface which is directly linked to Nlets. 

4.	Statutory Authority: The statutory authority for this justification is 9 U.S.C. Chapter 9, and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  Nlets meets that standard. 
5.	Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above: Access to Nlets enables VA law enforcement to fulfill its operational needs and to ensure optimum continuity of VA law enforcement operations at affected VA sites nationwide.  Nlets is a unique, one of-a-kind organization that is the only provider of the required membership services that are critical to the successful performance of the Office of Security and Law Enforcement's chief functions in order to ensure the safety and well-being of Veterans and VA employees. 
6.	Efforts to Solicit Potential Sources: VA Office of Acquisition Operations (OAO), Acquisition Business service (ABS) will post a synopsis of this action to the Federal Business Opportunities website (fbo.gov) in order to publically announce the need and to prompt commercial industry to respond should they possess the same unique capabilities. 
7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost: The annual membership fees charged to the Department are comparable to those charged to other Federal agencies and those that have been historically paid by VA in the past. 
8.	Market Survey: A market survey conducted by the Program Office indicated that there are no other sources capable of providing these unique and specialized sensitive security-sharing services ensuring the safety of Veterans and VA employees. 

9.	Additional Support for Other than-Full and Open Competition: Nlets links together and supports every state, local and federal law enforcement, justice and public safety agency for the purposes of sharing and exchanging critical information. It is a 501 (c)(3) not-for-profit corporation operated by the fifty states, districts and territories known as the Principal membership and is administered by a Board of Directors elected from those state law enforcement agencies.  Nlets is unique in that it operates an international system and network accessible by all criminal justice agencies and is the only provider of this capability in the U.S.  The users of the network are criminal justice and law enforcement agencies, both state and Federal. There is no other similar or comparable service entity in the United States, public or private, that provides the capability. 
10.	Future Competitive Plans: VA personnel will continue to research the industry to try to determine the commercial availability of such specialized criminal justice services.

FAR PART 8.405-6 
 
2237 Transaction #: 777-12-3-1022-0266 

This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in par. 3 below is sole source, therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules, is precluded for the reasons indicated below.  

Restricted to the following source:  Provide original manufacturer's name for material or contractor's name for service.  (If a sole source manufacturer distributes via dealers, ALSO provide dealer information.)

Manufacturer/Contractor: ESI International	
Manufacturer/Contractor POC & phone number:  ESI International/Nikki Redfearn/703.5583072	
Mfgr/Contractor Address: ESI International/901 North Glebe Road Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22203	
Dealer/Rep address/phone number: Susan Barron ESI International Sales Manager Government Markets/901 North Glebe Road Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22203/703.558.3047	

1  The requested material or service represents the minimum requirements of the Government.

(1)  AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:	Department of Veterans Affairs	
	SAO/PCO East St. Louis
		11152 South Towne Square
		St. Louis, MO 63123	
                                                                          
(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
The purpose of this action being approved is to acquire project management (PM) and related training services that will enable VA and VHA to continue to develop, implement, and maintain an effective, consistent project management curriculum and training program to support the need for employee education and development.  The resulting training program or curriculum is aligned with project management training being provided within the Department of Veterans Affairs and is based on the current version of Project Management Institute's (PMI) A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). The purpose of the VHA project management-training program is to complement supporting infrastructure to increase effectiveness of VA's professional staff with accepted project management knowledge, tools, and techniques.  An expected outcome is increased use of project management work practices for team members and staff and approaches to facilitate successfully implement projects, i.e., successfully managed work efforts where projects will be completed on time, within budget, within scope, and at a desired level of quality. This program compliments other efforts within VA but tailors to those who do not require such rigor of FAC-PPM courses and certification and to the audiences that require e-learning solutions, Business Analysis specific training, and advanced PM training for continuation purposes.

(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:

850 e-training licenses & administrative support for said items from ESI International PM and related course from IRS BPA TIRNO-12-Z-00012 line item 0003D page 3.	
	
	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $552,500.00	

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE:   On or about August 30, 2012

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

1	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.

The EES VHA Project Management Training (PM) Program brings PM and Business Analysis (BA) related knowledge, skills, and abilities to VHA program offices and VISNS. These courses are in a variety of delivery formats to include synchronous and asynchronous formats. Students who do not require higher level of curriculum and/or certification in these fields gain expertise by attending courses that are "just in time" and vital for obtaining or maintaining PM & BA proficiencies. The ESI core curriculums have been the baseline for initial and continuation programs for the targeted audiences across VHA's non-FAC-PPM clients, and the legacy and current training program relies on the consistency the services and courses provide. This contractor has a solid unblemished history of services and support for the current program in regard s to registration, tracking, reporting, evaluation statistics, and support for all aspects of the VHA PM Training Program. This is a follow on procurement, under an open IRS BPA, for an existing EES training program that has demonstrated success for over a decade. The contractor is proficient and familiar with all aspects of the delivery support of the program.	

0	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
 (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)	

0	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  
____________________________________________________________________________

1	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.

The following processes, infrastructure, and services is currently in place within the EES VHA PM Training Program and will incur retrenchments concerning FTE, time, and expenses particularly to the following pieces: VHA PM training course registration process; VHA PM training database; VA TMS recording an SPE processes; VHA program office and VISN PM training approaches; and VHA PM training intranet site.	

1	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 

Last orders placed under the IRS BPA: 850 licenses (VA777-C17180, dated July 25, 2011); 850 licenses (VA777-C00556 dated July 27, 2010) .	





1	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 

In the past VA/VHA had a BPA for purchasing ESI PM and BA classes/licenses.  The VA BPA expired a couple years ago and another VA BPA was not prepared because the IRS BPA was available for follow on purchases and was opened to all government offices for orders.  The IRS BPA (TIRNO-12-Z-00012) is scheduled to expire on   September 30, 2012. The VHA PM Training Program anticipates that this IRS BPA order will be the final requirement for purchasing ESI licenses.  Acquiring these licenses under the IRS BPA will allow the program to supply classes and courses to our clients, through August, 2013. The following business efforts rely directly on the management of the training program: (1) A 10+ year database for non-FAC-PPM  and BA training of over 3000 VA students; (2) A registration system, training support web portal, and EES specialized consulting efforts for all VISNs and VHA POs; (3) Continuation of VHA PO and VISN PM training strategies that are currently ongoing and expected to continue into 2014; (4) The reliability of same page methodology and terminology for sound basic project management and business analysis principles that comply and mesh with international/national government & industry standards.	

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  

This is a follow-on purchase from a reliable BPA, the services and past history of the vendor are unblemished and have been outstanding for 5+ years, the special approved pricing of the services offered to the VA as a customer is fair, reasonable and in best interest to the VA. 	

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Standard market research was completed for the previous, expired VA BPA with ESI international. Market research was conducted by the IRS per their agency regulations, for the current IRS BPA TIRNO-12-Z-00012 prior to the initiation and execution of the single BPA with ESI.	

(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:

The VA has purchased these services in support of the national training support efforts under the EES VHA PM Training Program for over 10 years. We are requesting approval to make a final task order purchase from a Federal Agency BPA that is open for orders from all government offices.	
?
(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:

For this procurement, placing an order under IRS BPA # TIRNO-12-Z-00012, a single source BPA is in the best interests of the VA, price and other factors considered. Should additional requirements for these services become evident during the timeframe between expiration of the IRS BPA and the execution of an anticipated 
E-learning module of same/similar curriculum by the VA Acquisition Academy, a competitive procurement package will be developed and issued by the VA EES.	
	
	

(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.  (This signature is the requestor's supervisor, fund control point official, chief of service or someone with responsibility and accountability.)
