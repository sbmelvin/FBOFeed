Evaluation of the contractor’s unique capability and existing products, concluded that the highly specialized effort required is available from only one source.

This effort would require both a facilities and storage capability of at least the SECRET NO FOREIGN level, and the ability to support secure communication capabilities at the SECRET NO FOREIGN level.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size standard are 541330/$23.0 million.  No solicitation documents exist at this time.    NUMBERED NOTE 22 APPLIES

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is soliciting proposals in accordance with the Simplified Acquisition Procedures in Part 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  This is a full and open competition.
The purpose of this procurement is to provide support to promote more inclusive training on the subject of health disparities and to bring the subsequent research relevance to a broad cross-section of State and Local Maternal and Child Health (MCH) officials.  This activity will continue to apply new analytic models to examine the multidimensional and contextual aspects of disparity issues.  It is anticipated that a better understanding concerning the context of disparities in health outcomes obtained as results of the study may lead to more effective public health interventions and the identification of appropriate collaborations between public health and other sectors of the community.  An important component of this project is translation of the implications of the study's rigorous analysis to recommendations for State and local officials in order to improve policies and intervention effectiveness.

<SUBJECT>66 -- The Vitrobot™ Vitrification Robot
<SOLNBR>NIH-NIDDK-04-298
<RESPDATE>091304
<ARCHDATE>09282004
<CONTACT>Diana Ly, Contract Specialist, Phone 301594-7730, Fax 301-480-8261, Email LyD@extra.niddk.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) have a requirement to purchase a Virobot™ Vitrification Robot from Fei Company, 7451 NW Evergreen Parkway, Hillsboro, OR 97124.  This device will greatly improve the quality of the work in the lab and save valuable time in preparing specimen.  The following specifications shall be included in the system:  

The Vitrobot™ Vitrification Robot
The Vitrobot™  (Vitrification Robot) is a fully PC-controlled device for vitrification (rapid cooling) of aqueous samples.  Minimal training is required when operating the instrument for research purposes in a laboratory environment.  The process of plunging, blotting and vitrification is fully automated upon placing a vial in the chamber and setting up the liquid coolant container.  Operational parameters are reproducible and the result is strictly PC controlled, enabling a high throughput of vitrified samples, with an easy and straightforward control of the vitrification process.  The parameters to be influenced are:  temperature, humidity, the number of blottings and a number of critical time settings.  The instrument will consistently produce excellent specimens for cryo-electron microscopy.  Researchers can now rely on specimen preparation allowing the investigator to concentrate on structural studies of the specimen.

Instrument Control
The Vitrobot™  is fully controlled by an embedded/integrated PC, equipped with the Windows operating system.  Specific instrument control and operational parameters set-up are done through a Graphical User interface and/or with a mechanical foot-pedal switch.

Sample Application
Software controlled dipping/withdrawing of the grid from a vial.  Small sample volumes can also be applied manually through a small side port allowing access to a pipette.  Both application time and wait time (time between application and blotting) are software controlled and can be set through the Graphical User interface.

Blotting Device
Excess fluid is removed from the grid by (repeatedly) blotting with filter paper on rotating foam pads.  Both the number of blotting actions (max. 16 times for one grid) and the duration of blotting (blot time) are software controlled and can be set through the Graphical User interface.  Longitudinal grid positioning (“blot offset”) as well as the wait time between blotting and vitrification (“drain time”) is user definable.

Vitrification Process
Automated shutter control allows for an instant and smooth injection of the sample grid into the container with liquid ethane and/or propane.  A lift for the container brings the coolant as close as possible to the shutter to ensure optimal vitrification.  Parallel coupling between lowering of the coolant container and the position of the frozen grid remaining inside the coolant.  This minimizes any possible contamination prior to the sample transfer into a storage box or cryo holder.

Additional Devices
The Vitrobot™ is standard delivered with a Phillips 15” LCD monitor, a slim-line keyboard, a mouse and a foot-pedal switch.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends on entering into a sole source procurement with Sheffield Measurement, Inc. of Fond Du Lac, WI, under the authority of FAR Subsection 13.106-1(b).  This procurement is necessary to upgrade two existing Sheffield RS-5 Coordinate Measuring Machines owned by NIST.  The machine controller uses proprietary code to talk to the CMM.  The software uses proprietary code to talk to the control.  All of these must act together to ensure that the CMM functions to the manufacturer’s specification.  PC-DMIS CAD is the only CMM software that allows the use of an untranslated Pro-E CAD model to produce part program code for this specific controller, thus ensuring data integrity.  Sheffield Measurement, Inc., is the only known company that sells or distributes the necessary CMM upgrades that consist of an SMP400 control and PC-DMIS CAD software; it is the sole provider of this combined technology.  Additionally, the software’s measurement algorithms are PTB certified.  This purchase will include related items such as installation, training, licensing, service and support, CAD interface, and warranty.  It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order will be awarded.  No RFQ package is available.  Any interested party may submit, in writing, a detailed capability statement to respond to this requirement.  However, a determination by the Government to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotes.  If no affirmative responses are received by August 26, 2004 by 10:00am local time, the Contracting Officer will proceed with the award to Sheffield Measurement, Inc.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) on a sole source basis with the American Association for International Aging, Albuquerque, NM. A recent  Congressionally mandated report, “Unequal Treatment,” found that “even when [their] insurance and income are the same as those of whites, minorities often receive fewer tests and less sophisticated treatment for a panoply of ailments.” This and other recent reports argue that health disparities can be reduced through assiduous attention to data systems and analyses.  Despite this awareness, very little national data is available that can be analyzed by race and ethnicity.  In addition, there are very few tools that make the data that are available useful.  The purpose of this project is to develop and implement a plan to create a health disparities database and GIS tool focused on the health inequities of the indigenous people of the United States.   The proposed requirement will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Acquisition of Non-Commercial Items. The American Association for International Aging has developed a proprietary application using GIS technology to display sensitive demographic and health data pertaining to Native Americans.  The project will enable NLM to have access to that software and work with the developers to construct an interface suitable for public access.  As a member of the Cherokee Nation, the lead staff member of the proposed contractor also has great credibility within minority communities, specifically Native American tribes, and can take a leadership role in identifying potential data sources.  Working with this organization is the only way that NLM will not only have access to the desired application, but will enable the library to make this tool available to the public.  The Period of Performance is a base period of six months, with a one year option period. This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a capabilities statements in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the referenced services as specified above.   All capabilities statements received in response to this notice will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria:  Knowledge of and experience with the technology necessary to carry out this work including Geographic Information Systems and databases software, programming for the world wide web (30%); knowledge of or experience with data sources:  demographic, vital statistics and other health data and data sources, particularly those appropriate for indigenous populations and sources of data for environmental hazards required to carry out this project (30%); prior experience with issues of health disparities in minority populations (30%); prior experience successfully managing relevant government contracts (10%).  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice. Proposal must include pricing information.  NLM Synopsis No. NLM 04-220-VMW shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.    Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Valerie M. Whipple, Contracting Officer on (301) 496 6546.

<CONTACT>Randall Pickwell, Contract Specialist, Phone 4109661325, Fax 4109659560, Email randall.pickwell@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Thomson Financial Publishing (TFP) to effectively and efficiently verify depository accounts and to detect unreported depository accounts at financial institutions. To date, TFP, located at 4709 West Golf Road, 6th Floor, Skokie, Illinois 60076, is the only company identified by SSA that has the capability for detecting unreported depository accounts at financial institutions using the customers name and social security number as the identifying information. TFP serves as the Official Registrar of the Routing Number System for the American Bankers Association (ABA); they are purportedly the single source for assigning and retiring routing numbers for every institution that meets the criteria established by ABA; and it is believed that every financial institution in the US must come to them to be assigned, to retire, or to change a routing number. In their capacity as Official Registrar of the Routing Number System for the ABA, TFP collects, processes, and maintains a database of current information on financial institutions worldwide. The SSA has previously conducted extensive market research and published multiple sources sought notices to identify alternative sources of supply for these services. This research has demonstrated to the SSA that TFP is the only organization uniquely qualified to implement all the tasks required by SSA. SSA’s previous market research/ public notices can be found at: http://www1.eps.gov/servlet/Documents/R/58960, http://www1.eps.gov/servlet/Documents/R/204511, and, http://www1.eps.gov/servlet/Documents/R/629327. SSA previously awarded a one year purchase order to TFP for a Proof of Concept (POC) for these services. During the POC phase TFP successfully demonstrated a process for verifications and reimbursement requests from a number of test offices in selected states. This involved converting to electronic media the informational exchanges that now occur in paper form each year between financial institutions and SSA during the initial application period and the re-determination process. In addition to requesting account balances and interest income revealed by the applicant/recipient, the POC also requested and verified titling and balance information on all types of accounts or certificates held by the applicant/ recipient. This notice is to publicize that the initial (POC) phase will be successfully concluded soon, and that the second follow-on “Fully Developed Phase” (FDP) featuring a potential nationwide roll-out of the SSA/TFP proprietary accounts verification program will follow during fiscal year 2005. The FDP will include system development to fully automate the account verification, reimbursement processes, with the ultimate goal to make the verification process totally transparent to the user so that the system automatically generates verification requests, records the response and then only generates alerts to the user for cases requiring further action. The FDP will have a period of performance of base one year period and four one-year options. Again, this is a notice of intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with TFP for these follow-on services and not a request for competitive proposals. Any responsible firm that feels it has the capability to provide this requirement and has similar capabilities and resources as Thomson Financial Publishing may respond in writing no later than August 31, 2004 with capability statements and information describing in full detail their capabilities to accomplish SSA's objective. Additionally, respondents should cite specific examples of their experience in detecting unreported depository accounts at financial institutions using the customers name and social security number as the identifying information. Interested parties that feel they can provide these services may respond by submitting their capability statement by email to Randall.Pickwell@ssa.gov. All responses shall be marked CAPABILITY STATEMENT- FINANCIAL INSTITUTION VERIFICATION. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received by the cutoff date above, the SSA will proceed with sole source negotiations with TFP. Again, all questions and submissions in response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the e-mail address listed above. Telephone calls regarding this matter will not be accepted, nor will they be returned.

<DESC>The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) submitted a proposal in response to an Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for participation in the 2009 Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Investigations.  The NASA GSFC has proposed an instrument suite designated Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM), which if selected, will be designed to carry out a detailed in situ chemical and isotopic analysis of the solid phase material sampled from the surface and subsurface of Mars as well as a sensitive and detailed study of atmospheric gases.  The SAM experiment will require a number of specialized components (pressure regulators, capillary leaks, pressure sensors, cartridge heaters, thin-film heaters, microvalves, miniaturized turbomolecular vacuum pumps, and electronic designs and packaging for the high voltage power supplies and filament emission regulator) with proven flight heritage in order to successfully meet the requirements specified in the MSL AO.  If the SAM proposal is selected, the NASA GSFC intends to non-competitively procure the services of ARi Industries, Autoflo Products, Collimated Holes Incorporated, Kulite Semiconductor Products, Minco Products Incorporated, Aker Industries, Creare Incorporated, and Battel Engineering to supply specialized components for the SAM experiment. Each non-competitive procurement will be conducted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)- "Only One Responsible Source".  The non-competitive procurements are described below.  Autoflo Products will provide a miniaturized pressure regulator that can achieve a 250C bakeout requirement.  Autoflow designed and developed a small proprietary pressure regulator that can successfully operate under this condition.	The pressure regulator has flight heritage and is onboard the Cassini spacecraft.  Autoflo's pressure regulator is at the highest technical readiness level of any regulator in industry.  Collimated Holes will provide capillary leak assemblies.  Collimated Holes designed and developed capillary leaks for the Cassini/Huygens GCMS experiment.	Collimated Holes developed a leak tight interface between the glass and metal adapter that could withstand the high temperatures needed for the GCMS.  Collimated Holes developed a proprietary glass to metal seal and have capillary leaks fully spaceflight qualified onboard the Cassini spacecraft.  Collimated Holes is the only manufacturer that has capillary leaks with flight heritage.  Kulite Semiconductor Products will provide miniaturized pressure sensors used on the Cassini/Huygens GCMS experiment.  Kulite Semiconductor designed and developed the processing steps required to insure survivability of their standard pressure sensors.  Kulite Semiconductor is the only manufacturer of pressure sensors with flight heritage that can survive a 250C bakeout.  ARi Industries and Minco Products Incorporated will provide cartridge and thin film heaters.  Both ARi and Minco Products provided heaters for the Cassini/Huygens GCMS.  ARi and Minco Products have heaters with flight heritage.  The same proprietary designs, fabrication drawings, processes and specifications used by both companies to manufacture the Cassini/Huygens heaters can be used for SAM. Aker Industries will provide microvalves needed in the gas processing system.  Aker Industries has provided microvalves for the following planetary missions:	the Galileo mission to Jupiter, the Cassini/Huygens Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer, and the CONTOUR Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer.	Aker's valves are technologically advanced with features that have not been duplicated anywhere in the world.  Aker's valves have a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) of between 8.5 and 9.0 which is the highest TRL of any valve of this type.  Creare Incorporated will provide miniaturized turbomolecular vacuum pumps. Creare's miniaturized turbomolecular pump is the smallest pump of its kind in the world and the design is such that it allows venting directly to the Martian atmosphere.  This pump eliminates the need to have a backing pump which would add a considerable weight penalty for SAM.  Creare's miniaturized turbomolecular pump has been successfully qualified under simulated Mars conditions and the pump now has the highest technological level of any existing miniaturized pump.  Battel Engineering will provide electronic designs and packaging for the high voltage power supplies and filament emission regulator.  The high voltage power supplies and filament emission regulator are two of the most complex packaging designs in the electrical systems for SAM.  Battel Engineering is providing the high voltage package to the University of Arizona's Mars Phoenix mission for a mass spectrometer instrument having similar high voltage requirements as SAM.

<DESC>The purpose of this requirement is to interview current and past leaders of the women's business movement and produce a short (30 minute) video documentary.  Summarize key themes and prepare a draft final script prior to final editing.
STATEMENT OF WORK – VOICES OF THE FOUNDING MOTHERS: CONVERSATIONS AND INSIGHTS FROM THE PIONEERS OF WOMEN’S ENTREPRENEURSHIP

BACKGROUND

The National Women’s Business Council is a bi-partisan public policy advisory body created to serve as an independent source of advice to the President, Congress, and others on economic issues of importance to women business owners.  The Council is committed to:
•	Conducting research on issues of importance to women business owners and their organizations; 
•	Communicating these findings widely; 
•	Connecting the women’s business community to public policy makers; and 
•	Providing a platform for change to expand and improve opportunities for women business owners and their enterprises.

The NWBC is interested in connecting women business owners and their organizations to public policy discussions. As a critical part of moving forward is understanding where we’ve come from, this project will focus on capturing the stories of the pioneer women in the women’s entrepreneurship movement of the 1970’s and 1980’s – as well as the voices of the new leaders of today – and producing a video documentary to preserve those voices and stories. This project would involve interviewing these women leaders and others involved in the push for women’s entrepreneurship advocacy, producing a short (30 minutes) video documentary which would be disseminated to the women’s business community, and providing vignettes or clips from this work for future posting on the NWBC web site.

STATEMENT OF WORK

Task Number One:  Contact Subjects.
The contractor shall work with the COTR to determine subjects to be interviewed and contact them, asking them to be part of the project and setting up live, video-taped conversations. 

Task Number Two:  Develop Framework.
The contractor shall work with the COTR to develop an overall script for the documentary, and the major themes and messages to be addressed.

Task Number Three:  Taping.
The contractor shall conduct video-taped conversations with all subjects as outlined in Task Number One.

Task Number Four:  Summarize Findings and Develop Documentary Recommendations.
The contractor shall summarize key points from all taped discussions and use this summary to make recommendations for documentary outline, topic areas, final length and flow.

Task Number Five:  Create Documentary.
Work with the COTR to create a documentary based on the interviews from Task Number Three.

PROGRESS REPORTS
The contractor shall be required to provide a report detailing the progress made on the project and identifying and addressing problems encountered. This progress report shall be delivered to the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (“COTR”). At the end of one month, the contractor shall first provide a preliminary report to the COTR showing the progress to date and recommendations for completing the project. The contractor shall also include in the report a timely response to any questions or clarification of any points raised by the COTR about the project. At two-month intervals from the date of contract award, the contractor shall provide interim reports on the progress and shall also provide a timely response to any questions or clarification on any points raised by the COTR about the interim reports.

REQUEST FOR QUOTATION
The successful contractor will respond to this request by:
•	Providing five (5) copies of a succinct proposal of no more than 10 pages (including resumes and other addenda) and cost estimate for the aforementioned tasks.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>SUBJECT ELECTRIC PRIMER, MK45 MOD 1 DESC: The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Survey is to identify potential production sources for the MK45 MOD 1 Electric Primer Assembly NSN 1390-00-877-5245. The U.S. Navy utilizes this item in the 5/54 Naval Gun system.  This item is part of the MK67 Mod 3 Propelling Charge for 5 gun ammunition.  The item is threaded into the base of a cartridge case and tightened to a specific torque.  The Propelling Charge is initiated by an electrical impulse igniting a chemical composition that ignites a series of black powder charges.  The flame from the main black powder charge is vented through holes in the primer tube that then ignites the main propellant in the cartri dge case.  The metal components are zinc-plated steel, copper and brass.  The approximate dimensions of the final assembly are 21.5 inches long and 1.25 inches in diameter.  Final product contains an embossed headstamp with an identification number.  Though dimension s and specific components may differ, it is similar in construction/appearance to the MK161, M83 primers. Since this item is used in an automatic feed system reliability to perform is crucial.  Potential manufacturers should have experience in handling explosives and static sensitive explosive components.  Black powder is a hygroscopic material and moisture wi ll degrade performance.  Hang fires and misfires can significantly reduce system effectiveness and could result in damage to the gun or injury to personnel. The estimated annual quantities are 33,000 for FY05, 45,000 for FY06 and 15,000 for FYs 07 through 09.  The desired delivery schedule is to begin receiving product in December 2005 at a rate of 3,000 to 5,000 primers per month.  Please advise as to economi c order quantity and estimated price range for stated quantities. Interested contractors should identify company size, descriptive information on your companys manufacturing capabilities (equipment, capacities, facilities, critical skills), and past performance on electric primers or other similar items.  Participation in the effort is strictly voluntary with no cost obligation incurred to the Government.  The Government at its discretion and without explanation may choose not to purchase all or part of the item described herein.   All interested sources are requested to submit responses, but only in writing with clear and convincing documentation by close of business September 20.  This synopsis is not a Request for Proposal.  This synopsis serves as a market research tool to determ ine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal including the use of any appropriate small business programs. The technical data package (TDP) is classified as Distribution D-limited distribution.  Distribution D means that the TDP cannot be routed via the internet.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled "Advancements in Chemical Propulsion Technologies for In-Space Applications", NNM04AA01L which was posted on August 12, 2004.  You are notified that the following changes are made:  The following information is posted ONLY to clarify the request for technical information in the basic solicitation.   The due date for responses is hereby extended to August 30, 2004. THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS.  IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).	NASA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal.  This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining information for planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of chemical propulsion technologies.  Prospective offerors are invited to submit comments or questions to the identified point of contact, no later than August 30, 2004.	In responding, please reference RFI-NNM04AA01L.  BACKGROUND Research sponsored by the In-Space Propulsion Technologies Project is at the forefront of NASA's efforts to seek new means of enabling faster and more cost efficient missions to the outer planets.  Advanced propulsion technologies are being developed to contend with NASA's unique challenges of enabling missions with fast access throughout the solar system and the ability to rendezvous with, orbit, and conduct in situ exploration of planets, satellites and small bodies.  The information sought is for the advanced chemical propulsion technology area.  Technologies for ascent/descent and Earth-to-Orbit missions are not solicited.  This request is not for information concerning flight demonstrations, technologies beyond TRL 6 or at development stages less than TRL 3.  It is requested that the potential offeror provide a self-assessment of performance, schedule, and system goals for the chemical propulsion technology. TECHNICAL NASA is looking for ways to both incrementally and radically improve the performance of primary chemical propulsion for interplanetary spacecraft.  In both these categories, (incremental and radical) there is a need for improvements in thrust, specific impulse, reduced mass of propulsion systems and components, longer life, higher reliability, the ability to withstand severe environments and improve safety and operability.  All of these represent potential investment areas, which translate to better Discovery and New Frontiers scientific missions.	“Better” means more science from either better instruments or more of them, quicker science return, or science from places otherwise not attainable. The initial thrust of this RFI is to solicit ideas in the incremental improvements category.  Even a few kilograms increase in the science payload has a significant benefit for an interplanetary mission.	To this end, NASA seeks ideas from organizations that have flown chemical propulsion systems on deep space missions, based on their experiences.  In addition to ‘lessons learned’, this RFI is further aimed at the identification of mid-TRL technologies addressing challenges and issues that could be matured from their current state to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, in the next 2-4 years. The second thrust of this RFI is radical improvements in performance of primary chemical propulsion systems. These ideas necessarily would represent a departure from the types of systems that have been flown in the past, and innovative ideas are sought from all potential responders.  This portion of the RFI is necessarily still limited to those technologies now at a TRL of about 3, and maturing them to TRL 6.  The time frame for accomplishing this process would most likely take longer than 2-4 years. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS Only United States companies/citizens are requested to respond to this announcement.  This solicitation is further limited to those organizations that have recent, extensive experience in the development and operational use of chemical propulsion systems for robotic spacecraft for either extended-duration Earth orbital or interplanetary missions.  Interested parties should submit information not to exceed three pages plus a maximum of two resumes (not to exceed two pages each).  Responses should be identified as either incremental or radical improvements, as described above, and limited to one response per category per offeror.  The format is at the discretion of the potential offeror.  All proprietary information should be marked.  Responses will be handled accordingly.  Comments, ideas, and information may be forwarded to PS52/Betty Kilpatrick via electronic transmission or by facsimile transmission to betty.c.kilpatrick@nasa.gov or fax to (256) 544-6062.  This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review.	NASA may, at its discretion, elect to solicit additional information from selected offerors by requesting on-site visits to an offeror’s site.  The purpose for any such visit would be consistent with the guidelines stated herein and would constitute no intent to make an award as a direct result of this Request For Information solicitation.  Any site visits will be properly scheduled and coordinated in advance.  Any questions regarding this announcement should be directed to PS52/Betty Kilpatrick.  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/MSFC Business Opportunities home page is   http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html    Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.

<SUBJECT>A -- Fuselet Production Environment
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-BAA-03-08-IFKA
<CONTACT>Lori Smith, Contracting Officer, Phone (315) 330-1955, Fax (315) 330-8029, Email Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to redirect the focus area of this solicitation.  Previously, the Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, was soliciting white papers under this announcement for a Joint Battlespace Infosphere (JBI) fuselet production environment.  Due to a shift in fuselet research and development priorities, a new emphasis will be placed upon innovative technologies supporting autonomic fuselet composition and execution.  This rather broadly scoped topic is further broken down into the following focus areas:

FY05: Fuselet Business Logic Development;  
FY06: Semantic and Syntactic Convergence of Logic Specifications;  
FY07: Fuselet Accreditation and Enforcement.  

Specifically for FY05, AFRL is soliciting white papers in the focus area of fuselet business logic development, as described below.  More detailed descriptions of the other focus areas will be provided at a later date.

Fuselet business logic development deals with the ability to: (a) capture by way of specification the needs of information consumers in terms of the manipulation functions required of fuselets to satisfy those needs, (b) develop executable fuselet workflow models to enact the manipulation functions specified, and (c) provide feedback mechanisms so that fuselet workflow models and their execution can be continually assessed for their ability to sustain and improve the satisfaction of information consumer needs.  Fuselets will be required to be JBI Common Client Application Programming Interface (CAPI) compliant [reference the JBI web site at http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/tech/programs/jbi/] and consistent with current fuselet management services concepts [reference the fuselet website at http://www.fuselet.org]. 

The key to the success of the fuselet concept depends on the value of the information fuselets deliver to their customer (e.g., joint and coalition forces).  In order to achieve maximum value, a process and supporting infrastructure are needed to support the continuous improvement of the value of the information fuselets produce.  To ensure fuselets add significant and sustainable information value to joint and coalition forces, a customer-value-driven and performance-oriented process for developing, deploying, evaluating and improving fuselets is required.  This process begins with an assessment of the customer's information problems and needs [reference the fuselet website, section 5 of the draft Concept of Operations for JBI Fuselets].

Assessing the relevance and value of a particular piece of information to the operational context of an information consumer is not easily done in an automated fashion.  Autonomous or semi-automated methods and tools are needed for the creation and composition of manipulation logic based upon expressed or discovered information needs.  Manipulation algorithms for the production of information that is tailored to consumer needs might be developed based on observing the behavioral patterns of both information producers and consumers.  In the development of fuselet workflow models and manipulation functions, care must be given to prevent the production of trivial, irrelevant, redundant, or inaccurate information (pollution of the information space).  In order to assess the characteristics of information consumers, producers, and the effectiveness of the fuselet runtime environment (workflow engine), mechanisms for process instrumentation, performance metrics analysis and reporting, and event notification will be needed to provide feedback to information management stakeholders on changing consumer needs, changes in information sources, and the ability of a collective body of fuselets to optimally serve one or more communities of interest.

AFRL's reference implementation of the JBI (software and documentation) will be available as Government Furnished Property in the event of a contract award, and topic solutions developed under this BAA should be interoperable and/or compatible with this reference implementation.

There are no other changes to the announcement.

<DESC>Requirement is amended to include the statement of Work. STATEMENT OF WORK – BEST PRACTICES IN FEDERAL PROCUREMENT OUTREACH TO WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES 

BACKGROUND

The National Women’s Business Council is a bi-partisan public policy advisory body created to serve as an independent source of advice to the President, Congress, and others on economic issues of importance to women business owners.  The Council is committed to:
•	Conducting research on issues of importance to women business owners and their organizations; 
•	Communicating these findings widely; 
•	Connecting the women’s business community to public policy makers; and 
•	Providing a platform for change to expand and improve opportunities for women business owners and their enterprises.

The NWBC is interested in connecting women business owners and their organizations to public policy discussions. To better understand and assist in the Federal procurement process, this background research project would gather information from all of the Federal agency procurement officers in Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) focusing on all of the initiatives and programs they offer to women business owners (especially those which exclusively focus on women), and assess which are having the greatest impact. The resulting report would highlight best practices, identify gaps in program efforts, include recommendations for further action, and be shared widely throughout the government and small business policy communities to encourage more widespread implementation. 

STATEMENT OF WORK

Task Number One:  Identify and Contact OSDBU procurement officers
The contractor shall work with the COTR to determine individuals to be included and contact them, asking them to be part of the project and setting up in-person and/or telephone conversations.

This report shall also incorporate data from the Federal Procurement Data System, to show trends within and across agencies, specific industries of successful bidders, etc.


PROGRESS REPORTS
The contractor shall be required to provide a report detailing the progress made on the project and identifying and addressing problems encountered. This progress report shall be delivered to the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (“COTR”). At the end of one month, the contractor shall first provide a preliminary report to the COTR showing the progress to date and recommendations for conducting the project. The contractor shall also include in the report a timely response to any questions or clarification of any points raised by the COTR about the project. At monthly intervals from the date of contract award, the contractor shall provide interim reports on the progress and shall also provide a timely response to any questions or clarification on any points raised by the COTR about the interim reports. At least one draft version of the report shall be supplied to the COTR in advance of the final deliverable. The final report must take into consideration comments received from government employees and the COTR.

<DESC>Sources Sought and Request For Information (RFI):

General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Technology Service (FTS), Region 8,  has a requirement for non-personal services for local network exchange access and off-premise switching telecommunication service to replace existing “Centrex” and “Dedicated Transmission Service” services in the following cities and states; Colorado (excluding the Denver and Boulder metro area), Casper and Cheyenne, Wyoming; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Bismark and Fargo, North Dakota; Billings, Helena, Montana; and Utah (excluding the Salt Lake City metro areas).  GSA FTS is seeking Sources Sought and Request For Information for cost effective and innovative technical solutions for the following services:

1.	Circuit Switched Services (CSS), which include Local Voice Service (LVS) and Circuit Switched Data Services (CSDS).  LVS includes business line service, off-premises switch-based voice service, access to key systems, and access to Private Branch Exchange (PBX) systems.

<DESC>SOCIAL SECTOR ADVISOR
USAID/ARMENIA
YEREVAN, ARMENIA



1. SOLICITATION NUMBER: 			111-0804-004	
		
2. ISSUANCE DATE:				August 17, 2004

3. CLOSING DATE/TIME SPECIFIED FOR 
    RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: 		September 17, 2004

4. POSITION TITLE: 	Social Sector Advisor

5. MARKET VALUE: 	$74,335 through $96,637 (equivalent to a GS - 14))

6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 	two years

7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: 			USAID/Armenia/DSRO 	  				
8: POSITION DESCRIPTION:



I.        Background
 
Due to the immediate and dramatic needs of Armenia following its declaration of independence in 1991, USAID’s interventions in the social and health sectors focused initially on the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance.  Throughout the Mission’s 1999-2003 strategy, USAID/Armenia refocused its humanitarian assistance programs towards longer-term development efforts in the social and health areas.
Under the new country strategy (FY2004-2008), USAID/Armenia’s Democracy and Social Reform Office (DSRO) oversees work of three Strategic Objectives (SOs):  democracy/governance (SO 2.1), health (SO 3.2), and social protection (SO 3.4).  The “improved social protection” strategic objective will be achieved through three intermediate results (IRs):  improved social assistance services for targeted populations, reduced need for government subsidies, and established operationally viable social insurance systems.
The new strategy does not represent an abrupt break with past activities, but rather a forward-looking, results-oriented and longer-term development focus that is based on solid evidence of past results, lessons learned, evolving needs and new technologies.  For health and social protection activities, there has been a smooth transition as the Mission’s new strategy went into effect in October 2003.  Many of the previously-established activities are being continued, others have been refined and modified, and those which have reached their goals were closed out.  
The Ministry of Labor and Social Issues, the primary host government ministry with which the Advisor is expected to interact, is like most Government of Armenia (GOAM) entities, weak institutionally, resource poor, and suffers from severely inadequate budget levels.  This grim reality underscores the need for social sector reforms leading to the development of sustainable systems for social insurance, welfare and pensions for the most vulnerable populations within this country, where an estimated 55 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.

II.	Duties and Responsibilities

The Social Sector Advisor will serve as the Team Leader for the SO 3.4 team.
The incumbent will advise on general responsibilities to meet USAID’s strategic goals, provide policy guidance, and review work in terms of overall accomplishment of desired results.  The Advisor is expected to function as a senior professional, and carry out his/her work with minimal supervision, providing technical guidance to FSN staff, other contractors, partners and customers in the development, implementation and monitoring/evaluation of program activities.

The Social Sector Advisor will be expected to draw upon experiences from a wide range of disciplines in performing his/her duties.  New activities in the social sector area are expected to be fully integrated with other strategic priorities in the Mission’s portfolio, including economic development, short-term employment generation, civil service reform, alternative service provision, and local government/non-governmental organization development.
 
The Advisor will be required to provide accurate and informed advice to the Mission Management and key counterparts on the full range of social sector issues with particular emphasis on policy reform.  She/He will provide leadership in the technical and policy reform area to Mission Management, Foreign Service National (FSN) staff, partners, counterparts and customers.  The counterparts and customers will look to the Advisor to present viable and pertinent options to social sector issues.
   
The incumbent has the following duties and responsibilities:
 
•	The Advisor will provide substantive technical and advocacy leadership for USAID/Armenia’s social transition program.  This will include, but not be limited to: 1) identifying achievable development results in collaboration with USAID customers; 2) establishing dialogue with and obtaining/maintaining support from partners, customers and stakeholders; 3) obtaining Washington agreement on development results and related financing; and 4) obtaining Mission level approvals for initiating development activities.

•	The Advisor will facilitate achievement of social transition program goals to ensure that planned development results are achieved in a highly efficient, timely manner, consistent with USAID regulations and policies.  This includes the planning, management, reporting and budgeting responsibilities for SO 3.4 activities. 
 
•	The Social Sector Advisor will be responsible for ensuring the acceptable performance and completion of contract scopes-of-work (SOWs) for technical assistance and commodity procurement, terms of reference (TORs), work plans, delivery orders, budget tasks, and specifications by the short and long-term technical advisors as well as institutional contractors.  He/she will make periodic project site visits and write reports with observations and recommendations.

•	The Advisor will meet with host country officials and customers to determine needs for assistance in the sector, as well as meet periodically with other donors to report and coordinate programs and activities.  The Advisor will be responsible for identifying opportunities for USAID/Armenia to leverage other donor resources in support of USAID/Armenia’s social sector reform agenda.

•	She/he will assist in the development of a program of training and exchanges for social sector policy makers and professionals in Armenia.

•	The Advisor will be responsible for the recruitment, training and career development of competent social sector development FSN professionals, as required.

•	Other job-related duties as assigned.

<DESC>Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is hereby soliciting information relating to capabilities of industry sources to support Synergistic Decision Making Environments (SDME). The purpose of this requirement is to support the integration in a synergistic configuration for MDA post-LDO (Limited Defensive Operations) and quick turn-around continuing MDA legacy mission support to the Department of Defense.  The need to develop and prepare conceptual models and surveys on how to improve MDA physical and information decision-making environments is the basis behind this announcement.  The MDA has identified one company that it believes is uniquely qualified to perform this effort.  Requirements include the conduct of basic and applied research, technology development, systems analyses, and systems integration in the quick turn-around physical prototyping and scale modeling for MDA’s informational and physical  architectures.     Potential sources must be capable of conducting research and  development in the following areas: I) Concept Exploration: Includes analyses based on current/forecasted mission requirements (data gathering) impacting MDA decision-making environments through site surveys, market research, and interviews.  This includes an analytical perception of how the MDA can better operate now and in the future based on conceptually scaled data sets, computer simulations, and in-house media production.  This methodical insight and technological interface may lead to rapid integration, rapid reconfiguration, and rapid scaling of metadata to support developing MDA-enterprise requirements. Concept exploration may lead to a specific requirements definition package encompassing customer needs and architectural conception.  II) Infrastructure Planning: Includes the ability to collect and validate information needed to identify decision-making environmental requirements and provide options through modeling, simulation, and prototyping to satisfy those requirements.  Planning activities must encompass system engineering integration and stipulate requirements, milestones (schedule), location, and costs based on customer needs and conceptual exploration.  The purpose of this planning is to identify and determine features of all decision-making environmental requirements, including command and control facilities, through life cycle development, acquisition, operation, and disposition.  This information will be used for planning, budget estimating, and designing. Planning support may lead to a definitive vision, uniting notionally integrated systems and processes in an optimal spatial configuration.  III) Design Presentation: Includes the use of concept exploration and planning strategies to produce virtual plans or designs associated with decision-making environmental concepts and/or modifications. These designs shall articulate the innovative advancement of current infrastructures to meet emerging mission requirements.  The ability to make an informed build-out decision based on design presentation and functionality shall be a bi-product of this task.  This effort requires recent experience in Command and Control design/build activities, proof of concept studies, 3D physical modeling, rapid prototyping, virtual operation, complex multi-media production, and graphical representation.  IV) Technical Infrastructure Support: Includes direct technical support and consulting services to the MDA, JNIC and Operating Locations to include, but not limited to, infrastructure support to improve program integration, systems engineering, integrated analysis, information security engineering, information management, and facilities engineering.  Support the modeling and future integration of operational and technical capabilities.  Ability and experience in designing synergistic and complex multi-media secure collaboration environments for command and control decision making is crucial.  Provide technical and operational guidance to Government project managers in their development of capabilities and recommend technical tasking for inclusion within the projects.  Includes providing technical infrastructure support through rapid prototyping, 3-D physical modeling and other efficiencies for design, engineering, testing, and proof of concept processes.  Work will require immediate access to Secret, Top Secret, and Special Access Program areas and information.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541710, and the size standard under this code is 1,500 Employees (Not to Exceed).  Firms having the required specialized capabilities of the above requirements should submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC), 7 pages or less, for evaluation by the government documenting their ability and proven past experience in performing similar efforts.  It is requested that the following be included: name and address of firm; size of business (number of employees); average annual revenue for past 3 years; whether large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, veteran and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); GSA Contract # and pertaining SIN #s if applicable; an indication and explanation of whether or not your firm would pursue a GSA Schedule Contract Award if it is determined to procure the FCSR requirement through Multiple-Award BPAs issued against GSA Schedule Contracts; list of relevant work performed in the past five years, including contract numbers, technical description, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, and point of contact address and phone number.  All statements must be in font size 12, limited to 7 pages and are due by September 10, 2004.     Technical questions should be directed to Scott Pillet at 719-567-9284 or email: Scott.Pillet@mda.mil. Procurement related questions should be directed to Arthur L. O’Dea at 719-567-9367 or email: Arthur.ODea@mda.mil.

<DESC>Sources Sought

The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is posting this  request for information to conduct market research.  HRSA is seeking capability statements from organizations that can develop and implement a system to effectively distribute medications to individuals on the Ryan White CARE Act  State AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) waiting lists in ten states (Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, North Carolina, South Dakota, and West Virginia).  The Goal of this effort is to provide HIV/AIDS related medication to approximately 1,700 clients on the State ADAP waiting lists as of June 21, 2004 for the ten referenced states.  As drug purchaser for the HRSA, these specific transactions can be excluded under the Medicaid statute regarding best price calculations. Capable organizations must be able to provide all of the following services to all ten states for the one year term of the contract (beginning September 30, 2004):

·        Purchase medications  on HRSA’s behalf, on the agreed upon State ADAP formularies;

·        Receive prescriptions, check patient eligibility by ensuring that the client has completed an enrollment from and is eligible to receive services through the State ADAP;

·        Verify the validity of the prescriber’s license to practice medicine in the reference States using the State Medical Board website (physicians licensed to prescribe in the State); 

·        Fill prescriptions for drugs on the State ADAP formularies pursuant to prescriptions in quantities not to exceed a 60-day supply; 

·        Maintain updated patient medication profiles;

·        Implement quality management processes for the medication distribution process;

·        Receive, process, dispense and distribute medications. 

Mechanisms may  include mail order to eligible patients at the address listed on the enrollment form, existing distribution system used by several of the target states who dispense medications through a single central or contract pharmacy, or other mechanisms that can assure all eligible patients receive in a cost effective and timely manner;

·        Maintain reports as required by HRSA; including monthly statements showing the number of prescriptions filled, cost of drugs, dispensing and administrative fees and remaining balance;

·        Contact the State Liaison and/or HRSA Project Officer identified by HRSA with any questions and at various points throughout the period of the agreement to ensure the proper scheduling and dispensing of drugs; 

·        Ensure delivery of first and subsequent medications to patients within 7 working days or less after the date on which the organization has obtained HRSA funds and received complete patient prescriptions, enrollment forms and waivers, as well as other information necessary for the dispensing of medications to the patients; and

·        The cost of a contract  would include the cost of medications, dispensing, and distribution, all of which would be a consideration in selecting a contractor.

This is not a solicitation, but a request for information.  Please forward (Fax 301-443-6038, mail, hand carry, or e-mail)your capability statements to Anne McFarlane or Frank Murphy.+

<DESC>Notice of Intent: The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) intends to award to DHI Inc. a requirement for hydraulic modeling, performed using the MIKE21 2-D computer modeling program which was developed by DHI.  The specific objectives of the requirement are for the contractor to use the flood hydrographs developed for the three upland drainage basins for the 100-year, 15 percent of the PMF, and the full PMF flood events and hydraulically model how the resulting flood flows will affect the modified dam, spillways, fuseplug, trainer dike, and channel structures.  Those hydraulic modeling results will then be used to configure those structures, and the flood flows will be routed through the flood-detention reservoir and out through the spillways.  The reservoir may be enlarged by about 20 percent and the hydraulic modeling will be used to assess how well the enlarged reservoir would perform.  The flooding outflows will then be hydraulically modeled to determine how the downstream area(s) will be affected by the flooding.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the supplies/services that will satisfy the agency requirements.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  Firms believing they can provide a similar required service must provide supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  All responses received within 5 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by FAX at (303) 445-6345, Attention:  Gail Tinianow.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Firms need to identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for NAICS Code 541512 which is $21 Million.

<SUBJECT>28 -- Qualification Requirements Case, Augmentor
<DESC>QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

FOR

P/N:  5125T85G01                            					 	Previous Editions
NSN:  2840-01-490-1337 OK		                 			          	are Superseded
NOUN: Case, Augmentor, Aircraft [Afterburner Casing]


I.	JUSTIFICATION FOR QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

Criticality: The item is the major structural portion of the J85 engine afterburner section and supports the variable exhaust nozzle mechanism. Non-conformance to manufacturing drawings and specifications is likely to degrade the engine's overall performance and can lead to hot air leaks that will compromise the structural integrity of the engine. The drawing states that “Vendor Substantiation is required.” Vendor substantiation requirements for this item are based on FPD-STD-12A5, the drawings for this item, and General Electric’s Critical Engine Spare Parts Technical, Manufacturing, and Source Substantiation handbook. The purpose of vendor substantiation is to assure operational capability by imposing manufacturing process control for characteristics that non-destructive inspection cannot assure.

A.	Complexity: The item requires specialized manufacturing processes such as metal forming, sheet metal fabrication, heat treating, casting, and welding that have a major effect on the performance and durability of the assembly.

B.	Risk: Due to the criticality and complexity described above, this item is coded AMSC "C". Therefore, all offerors must demonstrate manufacturing capability, as defined in para II and III, prior to contract award.

II.	DATA/DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

All contractors seeking approval to manufacture the subject item must submit the following documentation/certification:

A.	General Electric drawing 5125T85, revision E or later, its parts list, and all subtier drawings such as the bolt drawings and drawing 5053T99 for the supports.

B.	All applicable specifications listed on the manufacturing drawings. A copy of the first page of the specification is sufficient to show possession.

C.	Documentation that the potential source has a quality system that meets/exceeds the requirements of ISO 9002 or commercial equivalent. Submit a quality control manual along with the documentation.

D.	Process sheets for manufacture of the item (same for III.A and similar for III.B).   

E.	Identify all processes and inspections to be performed by sub-vendors.  Identify the vendors. Vendors must be approved by the engine Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or the Government for the major processes. Forging and casting vendors must be approved by the OEM for that specific item, or a full raw material substantiation will be required before contract award.

III.	SUBSTANTIATION OF MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY

A.	Offerors requesting approval on the basis of previous  manufacture of production quantities of the same part for the government, OEM or other users of the end item engine must submit the following additional documentation/certifications:

1.	Evidence or certification that the contractor was responsible for the entire manufacture of the item-i.e. the OEM did not add any value to the item (should include all material, processes, inspections).

2.	Evidence that the item was produced in production quantities, the items met all requirements, and were acceptable to the customer.

3.	Evidence that manufacture was recent, within the last two years, and that there have not been any significant changes to the drawing since manufacture.

B.	Offerors requesting approval on the basis of previous manufacture of production quantities of a similar aerospace part for the government, OEM or other user of the engine must submit the following additional documentation/certifications:

<DESC>The response date is corrected from August 27, 2002, to August 27, 2004. ******************************************************************************************** The Bureau of Reclamation, Denver Federal Center, PO Box 25007 (D-7810), Denver, CO 80225,  has a requirement for a Security Event Management Tool (SEM).  This requirement is a result of a Bureau directive and will enable security staff to correlate the large amount of data collected into one centralized system to optimize Reclamation's Incident Response Capability (IRC) and IT forensics potential.  The SEM is a software tool which collects and reposits security event data from various Information Technology (IT) systems and devices.  The SEM is to allow security staff to analyze, assess, and track specific and a combination of security events.  The SEM will initially be deployed in the Denver Office (DO), Denver, CO, Perimeter and Security support of locally supported devices, servers, and enterprise systems (e.g., RECNET).  After the initial implementation in Denver, the SEM product will be deployed Reclamation wide as an integral component of IT security practices and procedures.  Other potential locations include Washing D.C., and Sacramento, CA.  The SEM should be deployed out to the rest of Reclamation as requirements arise and funding become available.  This deployment will entail development of base SEM practices, creation of a cadre of trained and experienced security staff users, and establishment of a documented body of Reclamation specific SEM experience.  The requirement consists of the SEM software, software maintenance and technical support, installation and implementation services, as well as on-site training.  A proof of concept will be required to ensure that the tool meets the requirements stated herein prior to award of the contract by the apparent successful offeror.  This will also allow Reclamation the opportunity to test the integration of all system components.  The proof of concept is to be performed the week of September 13, 2004, and should take approximately 2-3 days.  The SEM software is to be delivered by September 20, 2004.  In response to the solicitation, all responsible sources may submit a quotation which will be considered by the agency.  Solicitation No. 04SQ810731 identifies the minimum requirements and may be viewed and downloaded from the Fedbizopps website at http://ideasec.nbc.gov .

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment number A002 to Request for Quotation HSFEHQ-04-Q-0072 is to answer questions and extend the closing date for receipt of quotations.  As a result of additional questions, the response date for RFQ HSFEHQ-04-Q-0072 is hereby extended until Friday, August 27, 2004.
 
Following are the questions and answers.
 
1.  Q:  By what means is the Contractor expected to obtain contact information? Will contacts be entered through the site, imported from some other source, or some other way?
 
A:  It is anticipated that the contractor will have a pre-existing media contact database that includes contact information for radio, print, television, wire, networks and other type of media outlets.  Ideally, contact information should already exist with the contractor and not need to be entered or imported specifically for this contract.

2.  Q:  For the purposes of back up access, what forms of communication are available to a field office in a disaster area? Is it an option for the field office to send information through Headquarters?

A:  FEMA staff will fax the news release, advisory or other document for distribution to the contractor, and either fax or phone the appropriate point-of-contact to designate distribution list.  Since field offices need 24 hour access and we would like to provide all users with direct access, it is not an optimal solution to have the field office need to rely on headquarters to send information.

3.  Q:  What is the maximum number of users?
 
A:  The contractor is required to provide for 20 users to access the system on a regular basis, with an additional 20 users accessing the system for intermittent periods.  However, FEMA needs to be able to assign unique users, such that there may be no more than 40 active users at one time but 20 of those users may vary.

4.  Q:  Approximately how many contacts and/or groups are expected to be part of the contact database?

A:  There are approximately 25,000 media organizations in the country.  In addition, these organizations may have multiple contacts depending on the outlet size.  The actual number of contacts to provide thorough access to the nation’s media outlets should be provided and understood by the contractor.
 
5.   Q:  On what date is the service required to be online?
 
A:  It is desired that the service will be operational immediately upon award of contract, but is required to be operational within two weeks of contract award.

 
6.	Q:  Is the primary mechanism for forwarding documents to the contacts via FAX or via email attachment?  Please provide an estimated ratio of FAX to document attachment for distributions per month.

	A:  The primary distribution is expected to be fax.  At this point, 99% of our distribution is done via fax.

7.  Q:  On the past performance section, what exactly are you looking for in “Contract Type”?  Are you looking for a code or explanation?

	A:  We are looking for the contract type, (ie. whether it was cost plus fixed fee, firm fixed price, time and materials, etc.).

8.  Q: Reference Deliverable 1 – “… It is preferred that no special equipment or software be required for access and use of the system.”  Because users will access an online system, are we to assume that all users will have access to the Internet and some sort of web browser?

A:  Yes.  All users will have access to the intranet and will be using Microsoft Explorer.

Q:  Is there a minimum workstation configuration (operating system, browser, office suite, etc.) that we will have to develop to?

A:  Yes.  Must be Windows 2000 Professional and Microsoft Office Suite compatible.

9.  Q:  Reference Deliverable 2 – “The Contractor shall provide access to contact Information for print and broadcast media, …”  Who will provide the contact information, FEMA or the Contractor?

A:  The contractor will provide and maintain the media and congressional contact lists.

Q:  If FEMA will provide the mail list, is the mail list purchased from a commercial vendor(s)?  

	A:  N/A

	Q:  Who are the vendors?

	A:  N/A

	Q:  What are the database fields?

A:  This is largely dependent on what the vendor has developed, but would include organization, primary news contact, assignment editor name, phone, fax, website, address, city, county, media market, state, zip, media type, circulation, beat/subject interest.

 	Q: In what format is the data provided?

	A:  N/A

Q: How often can the Contractor obtain information from the vendor to comply with the RFQ requirement of “This information shall be regularly updated and maintained by the Contractor to ensure accuracy?”

A:  The contractor is responsible for providing the information to keep its database current.

 	Q: What type of database does FEMA currently use to store mail list data?

A:  FEMA purchases contact information for media outlets through Bacons, Burrell’s and Media Yellow Book.

 10. Q: Reference Deliverable 2 – “ Contractor to regularly update and maintain the contact info.” How does FEMA envision this being accomplished?  By importing updated lists into the database?  Or have they conceived enabling the contacts to update the information themselves, for example via returned email?

A:  It is assumed that the contractor has a staff who is responsible for maintaining the database, either by performing scheduled checks and verifications, inputting corrections provide by media organizations to FEMA or the contractor directly, and/or by installing updated issues of media database software.

11. Q:  Reference Deliverable 3 – “… In addition, the contractor shall provide capability to include additional internal and external contacts not included in the media or congressional database for distribution purposes as provided by FEMA.”  Who will be responsible for entering the “additional internal and external contacts” into the database?

	A:  FEMA staff

	Q: Who will be responsible for obtaining these additional contacts?

	A:  FEMA staff

12.  Q:  Reference Deliverable 3 -- "...target distribution … by … Circulation audience, Outlet type, Editorial interest or beat...etc.” Will this "insider" information be made available by FEMA to the contractor or is the contractor expected to develop these lists?

A:  It is expected the contractor will have this information as part of the contact database information.

13.  Q: Reference Deliverable 4 – Back-up system:  Pending setting up Internet accessibility at the DFO, will FEMA DFO staff have access to cell phones and/or Blackberries (PDAs) that can be used to interface with the electronic data system?  Or is a phone-based back-up system more realistic and acceptable to FEMA?

	A:  The backup access is anticipated to be through phone service.  

Q:  Has FEMA conceived how they expect this backup to happen? Do you expect the distribution to run locally in your environment or would the contractor provide a dedicated connection (DSN) so the contractor could run the distribution in the host environment? 

A:  FEMA staff will fax the news release, advisory or other document for distribution to the contractor, and either fax or phone the appropriate point-of-contact to designate distribution list.

14.  Q:  Reference Deliverable 5 – “The Contractor shall provide for the distribution of approximately 61,250 pages … to contacts to be received via fax or email …”
Does this statement say that contacts must be capable of receiving documents via fax or email or that the Contractor must be capable of receiving documents via fax or email for further distribution?

A:  Contacts have the capability to receive documents via fax as it is currently the standard mode of distributing information to reporters and news organizations.  More and more contacts are also providing email addresses for distribution; however, we continue to find fax is still the predominately preferred method of receiving information due to the time sensitive nature of the material.

Q:  Can this number be further broken down into the number of fax pages and estimated emails?

A:  The number is based on a monthly average of 350 documents of an average 1.75 pages each (that is, some will be one page, two pages or three pages).  Each document will be sent to an average of 100 contacts.

15. Q: Reference Deliverable 7 – “…assign additional user accounts on a temporary basis.” What role will these temporary users be filling? Will they be disseminating information, viewing rollup reports, etc? Have any other roles been defined?

A: The temporary users are our disaster assistance employees, who deploy to field offices after a disaster.  The users will be using the system to fax/email releases, advisory, fact sheets and other information to media contacts in the same manner FEMA HQ and regional offices will use the system.  They will also use the system to download media contact lists to use for outreach purposes, and will review reports or release distribution.

Q: Should there be any “user training” (either in person or online) for OPA staff and what aspects should it cover –Maintenance of database lists?  Distribution (how to send out information)? Statistics (how to generate)?

A:  It would be useful if the contractor could provide a very easy to use tutorial – either on line or in print to walk users through how to use the system.

16. Q:  Reference Deliverable 8 – “The Contractor shall provide FEMA the ability to enter a project/billing code for each distribution …”Can you please provide information regarding the billing code?  For example, 1)  will it always be a unique number?, 2)  is it comprised of an alpha/numeric combination of characters?, how long is the code?, who enters the code?, do all users know their billing code?, etc? 

A:  The project/billing code will be a unique number that references the source of the document; that is, there will be distinct codes assigned to FEMA’s HQ office, 10 regional offices, and disaster field offices.  It is numeric, and is expected to be no more than 4 numbers.  The user operating the distribution of the document to the media will enter the code, and will know the code to enter.

17.  Q:  Reference the Price Discussion: Under the Basis for Award section it states:  “Offerors shall quote based on price per page distributed; monthly retainer will be averaged based on estimated usage to facilitate comparison among users.” and under the Submission Requirements section it states: “The Offeror shall provide, in writing, a detailed price quotation.  The price quotation shall include, at a minimum, a separate unit price and extended price for the base period (1 year) and three (3) optional 12 month periods.”
Please clarify what is requested for pricing information.  We are not certain whether you are requesting a price per page or a fixed price for the work on an annual basis. 

A:  Since anticipated usage is expected to fluctuate monthly, it is anticipated that price per page will be the most appropriate fee system.  In addition, this appears to be the industry standard towards pricing media distribution systems.  

Q:  If FEMA is requesting information based on a price per page, this is difficult to determine because the majority of the documents being sent will be delivered via email and therefore pages are not relevant.  Pages can be converted into file sizes and priced accordingly.

A:  Actually, the majority of documents being sent are anticipated to be delivered via facsimile.  We would prefer not to use file size, as we include the FEMA seal and wordmark on all documents, and this art file and formatting information would most often be larger than the actual text included in the document.
 
18.	Q:  What is your ideal or vision for the system?  For instance:
Do you envision pushing documents out to recipients, or would you also want individuals to be able to log in and search for information?   For example, allowing a legislative aid to log onto the service and search for all messages that were sent out using particular keywords or timeframes?
 
A:  It is solely for pushing documents and information out to media organizations and members of congress.  There will be no log on for users to search for information.
 
Q: Do you simply want to send documents to individuals at each media station or would you be open to a more robust media interface, that included both push and pull communications, on-air reports, etc.?

A:  The primary purpose is to send documents to media outlets and congressional members; however, additional functions will be considered as part of the best value.  Push/pull communication ability is not a need.

19.  Q: Would your ideal system be used to communicate urgent alerts as well as send informational documents? 
 
A:  All information will be treated the same; however, it may be useful to have the capability to bump documents up if there is a queue of documents waiting to be distributed without losing the processing of the existing documents.

20.  Q:  Would you ever want to use the system to communicate to the general public?

  A:  No

21.  Q:  Regarding the messages:
Does the system need to be able to forward pre-created documents, or will a representative from FEMA type the message to be sent out into a browser window? 

A:  Forward pre-created documents 

Q:  Will the documents be Word, Acrobat or other format files?

A:  Word or text file 
 
Q:  Will the system need to store an archive of all the documents that were sent?

A:  It needn't store the actual document, but should store for a set time period the distribution of a document (can be referenced by document number as all are assigned a log number) as far as who it was sent to, who received it, and what fax/email contacts produced errors or were unable to connect. 
 
Q:  Will the system send text-only messages or will the messages include graphics as well?

A:  It will incorporate the FEMA seal and wordmark as a jpg file 
 
Q:  Should the system be able to send out messages to cell phones and pagers in addition to email?

A:  This would be a feature considered under best value, but should not add cost to the day-to-day operation of the system.
 
Q:  Will you want messages to be posted to an online system for self-service viewing?

 	A:  No

22.  Q: In terms of pricing do you expect to see a fixed price per page or variable pricing based on volume?

A:  We would expect fixed price per page. 

23.	Q:  What is your vision on how the system will work if the Internet is not accessible?  Would a FEMA representative connect to the system via land line telephone, mobile phone, or satellite phone? 

 	A:  FEMA representative would fax the information for distribution to the contractor (ideally) for distribution, and would notify the contractor the desired media outlets to receive the information.

24.  Q:  Please provide clarification on the following item under deliverables:
    
"5) The Contractor shall provide for the distribution of documents to contacts to be received via fax or email in a timely and expeditious manner, including providing the ability to send approximately 61,250 pages per month, estimated by current distribution averages of 350 documents per month of an average 1.75 pages to 100 contacts per distribution."  
 
A:  It is unclear what clarification is required.

25.  Q:  Are we sending 61,250 pages per month? or this is the ability of the hardware to broadcast up to 61,250 pages per?
A:  Based on the annual average of releases distributed, it is expected the monthly average will be 61,250.  Since it is an average, some months will be higher, and other will be lower.

26.  Q:  Is your current average broadcast 350 documents? to how many lists?

A:  Yes, that is the current monthly average.  As such, some months will be higher, some will be lower.  Each document is sent to an average of 100 contacts, which can be selected by pre-established list or by sorting contacts by a specified criteria (e.g. radio stations in designated media market(s)).

27.  Q:  How many distribution lists do you have? I understand there are 100 contacts per distribution. Do you mean one distribution equates to one list?

A:  There is no set distribution list.  The distribution is determined by the relevant media contacts to the information contained in the document.  The 100 contacts is an average.  As such, some distributions will be more than 100 contacts, and some will be less.  One distribution would be considered one document sent to the specified contacts selected from the overall database, so in effect, the “list” created for that distribution.

28.  Q:  Will the initial contacts be provided by the customer or will the successful offeror have to research and develop the client list to populate the database?

A:  It is preferred that the offeror provide that information.

29.  Q:  The definition of a page varies depending upon the medium employed. A printed page is one side of a (nominal) 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper, defined in electronic format as delimited by formfeed characters. We are using this definition in pricing the response. Is this correct?

A:  The majority of distribution is expected to be to fax numbers.  As such, a page is defined as 8.5x11, one side, text and jpg images (no more than two).

30.  Q:  Please elaborate on the statement "This contact information shall be regularly updated and maintained by the Contractor to ensure accuracy." in section # 2. Please define how regularly and by what criteria the Contractor validates accuracy. 

A:  It is assumed that the contractor has a staff who is responsible for maintaining the database, either by performing scheduled checks and verifications, inputting corrections provide by media organizations to FEMA or the contractor directly, and/or by installing updated issues of media database software.  The frequency of which this should be performed is at the discretion of the contractor, but should support minimizing the number of distribution attempts to contacts “bounce back” due to incorrect information.  
31.	 Q:  Please provide an estimated percentage of total time per month or percentage of total distributions described by minimal in section # 4? 

 	A:  It is anticipated that this would be no more frequent than 2-3 instances per year.

32.  Q:  Regarding "to be received via fax or email" in section # 5, is this clause describing the mode of receipt of the document by the Contractor or by the contact or both?
 
A:  By the contact.  All documents will be uploaded via internet access for the user to select contacts and distribute via the service.

33.  Q: Please define "special equipment or software" from section # 1. Are WinZip, Microsoft Word, or Acrobat Reader and other freely available software acceptable for viewing the received documents? This is especially significant to the FAX distribution.
  
A:  All FEMA users will have access to the intranet and will be using Microsoft Explorer.  It is not known what capability recipients have, but is assumed fax capabilities are consistent.  That is, a document that is sent to a fax number through this service will be able to be printed out by the receiving fax machine without any special modification.
