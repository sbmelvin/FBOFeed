<DESC>Description:

CONTRACT INFORMATION:  The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Indiana requires the services of an Architect-Engineering (A-E) firm for design of agrichemical handling facilities.  Engineering services are required for the preparation of plans, specifications, cost estimates, related studies, and all associated engineering services for the design and construction in various locations throughout Indiana.  Construction activities will include construction inspection, checkout, and certification.  

This acquisition process is being conducted in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  THIS PROCUREMENT IS UNRESTRICTED and is therefore open to all businesses regardless of size. The primary North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541310.  This announcement constitutes the only notice.

PROJECT INFORMATION: 

The government contemplates the award of two to five Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts resulting from this competition. Contracts may be issued up to twelve months after selection approval and will be issued based on the order of ranking of the firms by the selection board.   The number of contracts that will be issued will be dependent on the amount of work that will be required.   The initial contract period will be from date of award through September 30, 2005 and the government may, at its option, extend the contract until September 30, 2009 by exercising each of the four one year renewal options. 

Work under each of the contracts will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders.   Funding for these contracts is through the NRCS EQIP program.  It is anticipated that a maximum of $50,000 will be available during the initial contract period and up to $500,000 for all task orders in total for each option year of the contract.  This amount, however, may vary from year to year with no guaranteed amount.  The price of any single task order shall be at least $1,000 but shall not exceed $500,000. The cumulative value for all task orders for the contract period will not exceed $2,050,000.  Task Orders will be negotiated as firm fixed-price procurements.

Task Orders are expected to include civil, agricultural, and or environmental engineering services and other services as needed for preliminary investigation, design, and construction supervision of the defined project.  Services requested may require performing (1) field investigations; (2) engineering surveys; (3) geologic and soils investigations, (4) design and preparation of engineering plans and construction specifications, (5) construction layout and certification of completed practices in accordance with NRCS policies, standards, specifications and handbooks. The construction and design documents prepared under these contracts shall be produced in electronic format conforming to approved NRCS computer software.  All drawings will be submitted using AutoCAD, version 2000 or later or other similar CAD software that is directly convertible to AutoCAD.  

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Those firms that meet the requirements described and wish to be considered must submit THREE copies of Standard Form 330 for prime and any proposed sub-consultant to the Contracting Officer, Natural Resources Conservation Service, 6013 Lakeside Boulevard, Indianapolis, IN 46278.

Prior to the final selection, firms considered highly qualified to accomplish the work may be interviewed either by telephone or by formal presentation. 

If two or more firms are selected; the top ranked firm will be awarded the first contract, the second ranked firm will be awarded the second contract, etc.  If necessary, secondary selection criteria will be used as a tiebreaker between two firms considered technically equal.  Individual task orders may be competed among the contract holders and not necessarily given to the top ranking firm.

In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a federal contract. For information regarding registration, contact the CCR Web Site at www.ccr.gov.

To register in ORCA, you need to have an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record, a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) from your CCR record, and know your DUNS number.  Detailed information regarding ORCA and how to submit records is available on the ORCA website at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help and FAQs.  You also have the option of entering the SF 330 Part II information directly into ORCA.  Please indicate in your submission package if you have done this.

<CONTACT>Richard Ashley, Contract Specialist,(334)416-1796, richard.ashley@gunter.af.mil
<DESC>TITLE:  AIR FORCE GLOBAL FORCE MANAGEMENT (GFM) DATA INITIATIVE (DI)<br> SOL:  DFSG-GFM-DI-001<br> DUE:  17 June 2005<br> POC:  MS ROSEMARY B. BARNES, CONTRACTING OFFICER, (334) 416-1970; RICHARD ASHLEY, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, (334) 416-1796; <br> MS. LINDA JONES, GFM-DI PROGRAM MANAGER (DFSG/LRP) <br><br> DESCRIPTION:  This is an announcement of a Request for Information (RFI). The Government does not presently intend to award a contract but requests the following information for planning purposes.  The Development and Fielding Support Group Logistics and Readiness Division (DFSG/LR) is doing market research to gain knowledge of capabilities that have the potential for fulfilling automated information management requirements for the Air Force Global Force Management Data Initiative (GFM-DI). <br><br> The objectives of GFM-DI are to provide the warfighter with a common vocabulary (logical data model) for the Air Force GFM Community of Interest.  It will also provide the warfighter with a net-centric, web-enabled, shared space environment that exposes Force Structure Construct (FSC) data which contains the Air Force organizational structure along with authorizations for equipment, manpower, and facilities.  The assigned data for equipment, manpower, and facilities is then linked to Air Force FSC data to facilitate war planning activities.  GFM-DI is an "enabling" capability for discovering, accessing, and mediating GFM data rather than a "functional" capability for GFM analysis, planning, and reporting. <br><br> The GFM-DI is part of a Joint Services GFM requirement.  A perspective for this activity, written from Army experiences is at http://www.tdan.com/i029ht01.htm .  To function in this environment GFM-DI will need a complex configuration management process capable of quickly responding to changes coming from the Joint Staff model, changes to the actual Air Force structure, and changes from published interfaces. <br><br> This RFI is seeking information on the availability of any procedures, processes, or products (solutions) that may have the capability to be rapidly fielded, operated, maintained, and managed by the Air Force to solve the GFM-DI objectives.  The solutions should have a viable presence in industry or Government and should be in current use in applications similar to the Air Force planned use.  To determine the extent the solutions can be adapted to the Air Force environment, DFSG/LR may perform an analysis of the real-world use of the actual applications and how they will support GFM-DI processes.  Information provided by this RFI will be used in preparing a business case for GFM-DI.  The results of this business case may be used for future GFM-DI solicitations. <br><br> The following information is requested for the Government analysis: <br> *	Basic product characteristics<br> o	Supportability - use of proprietary programming languages<br> o	Reliability<br> o	Open Systems/Standards Compliance<br> o	Net Centric Operational Warfare Data Principles Compliance<br> *	System Architecture documentation that will assist in<br> o	Identification of any differences between the system architecture and the Common Operating Environment (COE). http://diicoe.disa.mil/coe<br> o	Identification of any differences between the system architecture and the Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF) integration framework.  http://www.gcss-af.com/cfs/outreach/index.cfm<br> *	Communication Architecture<br> o	Networking approach - compliance with Net-centric Enterprise Solutions (NCES).  Additional information is at http://nesipublic.spawar.navy.mil/.<br> *	Security Architecture<br> o	The proposed products must have been developed and documented in a manner such that they are able to meet Department of Defense (DoD) requirements for Command, Control, Communications and Computers Integrated Support Plan (C4ISP) to include architecture and security. <br> *	Data Architecture<br> o	Identification of any differences between a proposed data architecture and the Air Force Net Centric Operations Warfare Data Strategy<br> o	Use of transactional data stores, operational data stores, and data warehousing<br> o	Scalability<br> o	Storage of historical data<br> o	Use of existing DoD Metadata Library artifacts<br> o	Use of existing DoD data Semantics vocabularies<br> *	Interoperability<br> o	Joint Staff,  Information Exchange Data Model (IEDM) <br> o	Identification of documented business rule relationships<br> *	Use of Business Process Execution Language Capabilities<br> *	Documentation availability<br> o	System support, administration, and end user<br> *	A proposed deployment approach and timelines (provide example of past similar approach) <br> *	Current Application(s) <br> o	Contact information for current users should include name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. <br> *	Licenses and licensing requirements<br> o	Each product should have an accompanying tentative pricing structure. Any pricing information will remain confidential.  Submittals are not offers that may be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. <br> *	Proprietary and confidential information should be appropriately marked as such. <br><br> Respondent(s) must specify in response whether it is a large business, small business, very small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, woman-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business.  In addition, respondent must specify whether it is a U.S.-owned or foreign-owned firm. <br><br> Contractor formats for the requested information are acceptable.  RFI submittals may be submitted electronically to the Contracting Officer identified below.  RFI submittals should be submitted no later than 1600 CST, 17 Jun 2005. <br><br> This is not a request for proposals.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This is a Request for Information only and does not, by its issuance, restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will not reimburse any costs for any information, documentation, and/or data submitted or preparation costs for submittals in response to this RFI. <br><br> Please note that the HERBB will be the primary source of information for the GFM-DI acquisition.  Interested firms should check for updates frequently and subscribe to the HERBB update service. <br><br> Firms are reminded that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to award a purchase order to the University of Minnesota for “MPO/State DOT Travel Survey Archive”. Under the BTS grant,  investigators formally contacted the 50 largest Metropolitan Planning Organizations. Several paper reports were received and were digitized and posted to the webpage.  Presently there are over 60 surveys from 28 metro areas and states together with documentation and reports available on the project web page. There are nearly 60 different data formats making tabulations from each survey or a combination of surveys very difficult. The main objective of the project is to organize the data into a standard format to allow for easy queries.  The project will use the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI)  a metadata  standard used for documenting datasets developed in European and North American data archives, libraries and official statistics agencies. The “Metropolitan Travel Survey Archive” was funded by the United States Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics from 2003 to 2004 (funding expires in mid-2004) under the “BTS research grants” program.  It is now housed at the University of Minnesota at http://www.surveyarchive.org).  This project is a continuation of the BTS project.  This travel survey archive is the only place in the United States where this work has occurred.  Moving it to another location would require extensive effort and would result in higher costs and delays due to loss of experience and familiarity with the archived datasets.  No other known source possesses the knowledge required to successfully provide this service. This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is on or about June 7th, 2005.

Earned media included write-ups in local papers and participation in local television programs.  Enforcement activities included special enforcement, training citizens to conduct neighborhood watches and deployment of speed trailers and photo speed enforcement trailers.  Roadway treatments included installation of speed humps and tables and application of products to the roadway surface that gave an illusion of a roadway impediment or engineering treatment.

<DESC>The NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the procurement of a road construction project in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. These roads are the main supply routes used to support the NATO-led Kosovo peacekeeping Force (KFOR). The estimated value of this work is 11 million Euros ($14 million USD).

NAMSA was nominated as Host Nation for this project, which was fully authorized by the Infrastructure Committee. The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFIB/IFB) to be issued is LKE 50008 and all correspondence in relation to this procurement shall refer to this reference. The comparable U.S. Department of Commerce reference will be IFIB-KFOR-PP-2005-LKE-50008.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The purpose of the NATO/the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Roads Project is the repair and improvement of bridges and carriage way structures on the NATO Main Supply Route BOTTLE (Part of the National Road M3 and Ml) in the direction of Blace to Bogorodica. Thirty bridges have been selected for repair and strengthening.

The reinforced concrete bridges of slab, arch slab and girder type structures were constructed between 1960 and 1980. The regulations for design and construction of bridges have changed over time. Bridges designed before 1981 were in accordance with the old regulations PTP-5 (Temporary Technical Regulation) issued 1949. For the bridges designed and constructed in the 1980s, the regulations are identical to the German Standard DIN 1072. The regulations issued in January 1991 are in accordance with STANAG 2021. Most of the bridges were designed and constructed in 1962-63.

Visual inspection has revealed the fact that poor quality material and construction methods have been used followed in time by lack of proper maintenance. The consequence is segregation, insufficient concrete cover with manifestation of reinforcement corrosion. All bridges are characterized by damages that are a consequence of aggressive influences such as: the penetration of saline water; bad or non-existing waterproofing on the carriageway structure; inappropriate waterproofing and corrosion of the reinforcement and concrete (severe spalling in some instances).

In addition, the bridges have been exposed to heavy commercial and military traffic beyond their design load bearing capacity. The design load bearing capacity of the bridges, designed in accordance with PTP-5, is not sufficient for loadings in accordance with Macedonian Regulations issued in 1991 and STANAG 2021. Further, for most of the bridges, no design documentation, drawings, sketches, or other documents have been found detailing how the bridges were constructed. Consequently, and before the commencement of design work, it will be required to restore the technical documentation (drawings and static calculation) of each bridge through a detailed field inspection and survey of bridge structures, including the determination of global geometrical dimensions, reinforcement of all structural members, and quality of incorporated material with sampling and laboratory testing.

The measures that need to be undertaken for all bridges within the design for strengthening and repair can be divided into two groups:

A. Repair measures (or more exactly measures to restore to the original AS DESIGNED condition) for those elements of bridge structure which, without any damages, would satisfy the new loadings in respect of their actual load bearing capacity.

B. Strengthening and repair measures: for those elements of bridge structures which, even without any damages, would not satisfy the new loadings in respect of their actual load bearing capacity.

DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED REPAIR/STRENGTHENING METHOD

Different bridge strengthening methods are acceptable, such as the addition of conventional or pre-stressed steel, installation of external pre-stressed reinforcement, bonded reinforcement, increase of the concrete cross-section, etc.

Recently, it has been possible to replace the heavy steel plate with light composite materials. The high-strength Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) strengthening system was applied the first time in the world in 1991 for strengthening a bridge in Switzerland. Some other examples can be shown such as the strengthening of 14 bridges of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on the National road M-2 between Kumanovo and the Bulgarian border. Also, the Ljubljana river bridge in Slovenia required strengthening due to the transportation of heavy loads and CFRP was used successfully. The Goksu and Karababa bridges in Turkey were both strengthened by using CFRP, due to the unforeseen need of transporting heavy dam construction equipment with a total weight of 270 tons.

Although the CFRP method is the preferred method for the strengthening of the 30 bridges in this Project, please note that bidders will not be restricted to proposing only this method.

One of the major problems seen in all 30 bridges is the lack of waterproofing and water drainage system. The deterioration due to the water and salt corrosion and erosion is significant. A mandatory requirement for all of the bridges, therefore, is the placement of waterproofing over the bridge concrete slab and installation of a water drainage system for the bridge carriageway surface.

Although the CRFP method, supported by other repair and reinforcing measures detailed below, is considered to fit best to those bridges, it must be always kept in mind that most of these bridges were built in 1962 and 1963, and unfortunately the required routine maintenance was not done. The strengthening is designed to maintain the upgraded load capacity for at least 10 years, but periodic testing for every 3-4 years is recommended.

DELIVERY SPECIFICATIONS

The target date for the start of the construction work is August 2005, with completion in 2006. At this stage, no follow-on services are envisaged. Optional requirements are also unknown at this time.

Quality Assurance will be in accordance with Industry Standards. However, the Bidder should have ISO 9001-2000 Quality System Certification as a minimum.

Statement of Work - SOW (Cahier des Charges) and subsequent procurement contracts will be, like this NOI, in the English language. Offers and any communication to be made by bidders, and technical data or documentation to be furnished by the contractors must also be in English.

<DESC>Eagle Ridge Stewardship Program Goals / Purpose This project will be accomplished through the use of a stewardship contract, which authorizes the value of forest products to be applied as an offset against the cost of services received; multi-year contract authority greater than five years but not to exceed ten years (Public Law 108-7).  The goals for this project are;  (1) to meet the needs of the community by providing wood products, (2) remove vegetation to produce a healthy forest stand, (3) reduce current fire hazards on Federally managed lands in the Bald Eagle Roost and adjacent  private and state-owned lands. BACKGROUND The implementation of this work will aid as a tool in achieving the goals and objectives of the National Fire Plan, the Healthy Forest Restoration Act, and the Platte River Resource Management Plan.  The Eagle Ridge property is located in the Jackson Canyon ACEC (Bald Eagle Habitat Management Plan for  the Platte River Resource Area and Jackson Canyon ACEC), and this project is aimed at providing protection of the forest resources in the Bald Eagle Roost, the WUI situation, and the recreation areas (Archery Range).  The forest stands are mixed Ponderosa and Lodgepole Pine.  Vast numbers of trees have died and many are currently infested with mountain Pine Beetles.  This has created a wildland fire hazard and a conditional WUI situation.  The historical fire regime has been absent from this portion of Casper Mountain and therefore the build-up of fuels (dead and dying trees, heavy woody debris with sagebrush and grasses bordering the forest) has created a wildland fire hazard.   SCOPE This project will include the continuation and completion of the fuel breaks being established on the southwest face of this mountain and the implementation of the forest health treatments on 35 acres over a 7 year period.  The current acres (35) include only the tree mortality.  The infested trees will also be removed and a buffer will be created between the infested areas and the healthy trees (20 acres).  Thinning will be performed on the residual stands (35 acres) to increase the effectiveness of the fuel breaks and provide a forest stand that is more resilient to insect, disease and fire problems.   Period of Performance  This is a multi year contract contemplated by Section 323 of P.L. 108-7, and as such may continue for a period of up to 10 years.  The period of performance for this contract will be from date of award to September 2012.  In the event that the cost of the services exceeds the value of the timber products and or the appropriated funds, the cancellation dates require by Federal Acquisition Regulation 17.106-1 will be mutually arrived.  Place of Performance  Eagle Ridge, Casper Mountain on lands administered by the BLM Casper Field Office, Natrona County, Wyoming  Site Inspection Tour A site visit has been scheduled for June 9, 2005 at 10:00 a.m.  Participants meet at:  BLM Casper Field Office, 2987 Prospector Drive, Casper, Wyoming 82604.  Contact Cindy Allen (307) 261-7676 for more information. Potential offerors are to provide their own transportation at no cost to the Government.  The Government assumes no liability on behalf of offerors attending the site visit.  Offerors wishing to attend the site visit shall contact Cindy Allen (307) 261-7676 at least 48 hours before the scheduled site visit, and advise her of the firm name and number of persons that will attend.

BUILD COMPENDIA OF SPECIFIC CATEGORIES OF STATE LAWS THAT MAY AFFECT EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH INTEROPERABLE HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS, ADOPT ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS, OR CREATE REGIONAL OR NATIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES.

THESE ACTIVITIES WILL CREATE A KNOWLEDGE BASE FOR USE BY THE DEPARTMENT AND THE RESOURCE CENTER IN PROVIDING BASIC INFORMATION TO GRANTEES AND IN REFERRING GRANTEES TO NON-AGENCY RESOURCES THAT CAN PROVIDE ANALYSIS AND ADVICE, SUCH AS LEGAL ADVICE, TO SUCH GRANTEES IN THEIR SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT FOR THE BUILDING MODERNIZATION PROJECT at the Mary E. Swtizer Building of the GS-11P-05-MKC-0036 

The synopsis posted March 31, 2005 and modified April 19, 2005 is modified to add the following information concerning distribution of plans and specifications.  The plan and specifications are going to issued electronically through secure website known as the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS).   FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information. It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOpps and the Central Contract Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.     In order to obtain information from FedTeDS, you will first be required to register with CCR.     The Central Contractor Registration database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an e-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity.  Effective October, 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.     You may access CCR at the following URL www.bpn.gov.  Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following URL http://www.FedTeDS.gov.   You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled Register with FedTeDS and then choosing the Vendor Registration Form hyperlink.     At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:     (Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your Company?s, CCR Point of Contact) your Company's DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), your telephone number, and your e-mail address.     Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.

<DESC>The National Environmental Satellite Data Information Service (NOAA/NESDIS) is seeking Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) that can provide scientific and engineering support for independent, objective assessments regarding the launch, space and ground systems for NOAA/NESDIS satellite systems.  

The incumbent contractor, The Aerospace Corporation, was awarded a contract in September 2000 to provide these services to NOAA/NESDIS.  If based on the results of this sources sought, it is determined that no other FFRDC can provide these services, then the Government intends to proceed with a sole source contract award to The Aerospace Corporation.  In that event, this synopsis meets the publication requirements of  a proposed sole source contract award to The Aerospace Corporation.  The contract will be for approximately 60 staff per year, effective November 30, 2005, for a base period of 1 year plus four (4) 1-year options. 

The NOAA/NESDIS manages NOAA’s operational geo-stationary and polar-orbiting environmental satellite programs.  The NOAA/NESDIS objective is to provide the spacecraft, launch services, and ground systems necessary to maintain the uninterrupted flow of remotely-sensed environmental data required to promote, protect, and enhance the Nation’s economy, security, environment, and quality of life.  The Contractor's role in the NOAA/NESDIS Organization is as an independent, objective, non-competitive Corporation whose mission under this contract is to support the program acquisition objectives of the NOAA/NESDIS and related NOAA programs. The Contractor will  provide non-advocacy assessments of program implementation, design approach, advanced pre-development planning, developmental and operational risks, integration and test data analysis, launch readiness assessment, on-orbit performance assessment, ongoing analyses of associated technologies, and support to failure analysis inquiries. The Contractor will provide technical assistance and advice in the preparation and resulting evaluation of complex technical specifications.

The Aerospace Corporation is considered to be the single, experienced capable source qualified to support NOAA/NESDIS with the required independent engineering analyses. The Aerospace Corporation, a FFRDC, formed in 1960 by the USAF, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. Sect. 2367, completed a Comprehensive Review in June 2003 that was approved by the Under Secretary of the Air Force for Research and Development reaffirming The Aerospace Corporation’s mission to support national security, civil and commercial space programs.  The Aerospace Corporation’s personnel have first-hand knowledge of the engineering design of delivery systems and the spacecraft platforms of military and civilian polar-orbiting and geosynchronous spacecraft. The Aerospace Corporation’s experience includes the integration of military, civilian and foreign meteorological sensors, the impact of command, control and communications links between the ground control stations and the platforms/systems, and the analysis of satellite instrument data. The Aerospace Corporation maintains the unique competency and diverse expertise through its long-term design support and engineering review of civilian and military meteorological satellite platforms. Its corporate and business practices protect Government and industry's interests and objectives by safeguarding proprietary and privileged information from misuse, and reducing the Government's costs due to duplication, delay and other general programmatic risks. The Aerospace Corporation’s corporate resources and facilities help advance the Government objectives to promote competition, reduce costs of acquiring and operating the converged satellite systems, and satisfy the programmatic requirements for NOAA/NESDIS. The Government's reliance on The Aerospace Corporation for this unique competence and independent base of advanced skills validates the exception from full and open competition under 41 U.S.C 253(c)(1). Other parties who desire consideration for this requirement must fully identify their capabilities in writing to the Contracting Officer within 45 calendar days of the posted date of this notice. 
CLARIFICATION:  Prior to the contract awarded in 2000, The Aerospace Corp. was awarded a contract during 1996.  
IN ADDITION: The FFRDC contractor shall have experience and technical expertise in analysing and assessing NOAA Satellite ground system operations, acquisition and developement.  The area of technical support to NOAA/NESDIS include satellite telemetry,  command,  instrument data, communication, ground system harsware and software, data products and data distribution.

<DESC>The 1st Contracting Squadron, Langley AFB, VA is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy for a potential requirement to provide refuse and recycling services for Langley AFB, VA and the Dept of Veterans Affairs – Hampton, VA.  The approximate volume is (1526) 95-gallon containers for housing units; (111) 8 cubic yard bulk containers; and various other sizes.  (see attached Tech Exhibit). Current contract services expire 30 September 2005.  It is anticipated that Langley’s Bethel Manor and Main Base Housing (residential areas) will be privatized within the next one to four years.  The estimated schedule for privatization implementation for Bethel Manor and Main Base is Aug 2006.  Possible delays or circumstances may alter this schedule.  The government will provide the contractor a 90 day notice prior to implementation for each location.  It is anticipated that the period of performance for this contract will be 01 October 2005 to 30 September 2006.  Seven additional option years may be exercised extending the period of performance until September 2014.  NAICS Code 562111 is applicable to this effort, which has a small business threshold of $10.5M.  The government is seeking information and comments from industry on various topics that will be used to refine the requirement and acquisition strategy to include the following:  (a) The government is contemplating a firm fixed price type of contract to fulfill this requirement based upon previous acquisition history.  (b) Initial research indicates this service is commercial in nature and we are soliciting beneficial commercial practices, terms and conditions for consideration.  (c) This potential requirement may be set-aside for one of three small business programs (1) certified 8(a) small business, (2) HUBZone or (3) Service Disabled Veteran-Owned small business.  Small business concerns that believe they have the capability to perform should complete the attached Small Business Capability Assessment/Questionnaire and submit it to the POCs listed below.  The Small Business Capability Assessment / Questionnaire is designed to provide general information regarding a firm’s capability and eligibility.  It is also designed to allow industry to comment on the concept of the “opt-out” clause and the Draft Performance Work Statement. All industry comments are encouraged and welcome to assist us with this requirement.  All documents associated with this projected requirement will be posted on the FedBizOps website, www.eps.gov.  Please submit your responses by noon EST 1 Jun 05.  The primary POC for this procurement is SSgt Devin Harley, 1 CONS/LGCS, 757-764-2922, e-mail:  devin.harley@langley.af.mil.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR AN INSIDER THREAT SOLUTION TO PROTECT THE DOD FROM THOSE WHO CONDUCT MALICIOUS ACTIVITY AGAINST OR ACROSS THE NETWORK, SYSTEM OR DATA.


SUBJECT

This document is a Request for Information (RFI) about available Insider Threat Solutions to protect the DoD from those who conduct malicious activity against or across the network, system or data.  

Responses to this RFI are due NLT Tuesday, June 21, 2005, at 5:00PM Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) (GMT-4). 

 
DESCRIPTION

The Defense Information System Agency (DISA) in support of the Computer Network Defense (CND) mission established by the United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) is seeking information from industry, academia, and government that will assist in the deployment of a software product solution to assists in elevating the CND posture of the Department of Defense (DOD) computer network systems.

The current solution to our computer network environment currently provides inadequate protective measures:

Individual Host and Network-based protective mechanisms do not provide real time protection from malicious insider attack behavior.

Transformational technology provides hope but not proven concepts for deployment.


The DISA is in search of product solution that can address the requirements below for possible further evaluation.

REQUIRED CAPABILITIES

This section describes the high-level capabilities for the Insider Threat Toolset.

Protect against system compromise: 

1.  Prevent malicious code insertion, system modification, vulnerability exploitation, content manipulation, and deceptive content. 
a. Malicious code insertion involves prevention of virus-bearing portable/removable media, the execution of mobile code, and the insertion of malicious code.  
b. Prevent and protect systems, servers and network devices from implementation of untrusted patches; resource reallocation and/or redirection; and modifications to software files by other than system administrators.  
c. Track all critical system component modifications, protecting against administrator account lockout, and monitoring access and changes to
d. Protect against replay attacks, zero-day exploits, the use of covert channels, and the installation or use of steganographic tools.

2. Prevent unauthorized configuration changes, and monitor internal e-mail events
a. Prevent the manipulation of content including unauthorized workflow changes that enable product modifications or modification of data.
b. Prevent and protect against ignorant manipulation, strategic information manipulation, and deleting/withholding content from reports upon inception. 
3. Protect against the accessing of unauthorized files and information including the prevention of unauthorized use or misuse, hacking exploits, transitive trust exploitation, and spoofing.
a. Prevent unauthorized use/misuse and hacking exploitation using replay attacks that retransmit valid data.
b. Prevent and protect against unauthorized use and/or misuse of files/information. 
c. Implement a data tagging/classification system.
4. Minimize exposure time of un-patched systems.
5. Prevent the use of keystroke loggers and steganographic tools.
6. Implement sandbox technology to enforce policy requirements regarding protection of system resources.
7. Prevent covert channel use, internal e-mail attacks, telephone taps, and protect against database adjustments.
8. Prevent transitive trust exploitation by protecting data integrity, stopping exploitation of collaboration tools, and protecting against workflow changes to include or exclude other 
analysts (dissemination).
9. Prevent spoofing and protect against using assets to collect information that benefits an unauthorized party.
10. Prevent exfiltration of data/information by using hard media, copying to removable media, and by electronic means via a network.
a. Protect against unauthorized broadcasting or transmitting devices in classified areas or meetings and disallowing telephone tap recording. 
b. Prevent electronic exfiltration of data/information via network means by preventing the exploitation of web conferencing capabilities, along with the cutting and pasting of data between classification levels (high to low), and the usage of cameras to shoulder surf.
11. Prevent and protect against RF transmissions, in and around local facilities.  

Detect a potential insider threat

1. Detect the introduction of malicious code and usage of cellular and wireless data devices.
2. Create a comprehensive list of system and user behavior attributes that can be monitored to establish normal and abnormal patterns enabling anomaly and misuse detection.
3. Use of network mapping tools to detect alterations in the configuration of a network along with scanning and analyzing system and network audit logs to detect anomalous system and inside activity.
4. Monitor system and application logs using a structured monitoring approach
5. Check file and access permissions within the system(s) to flag potential problem areas.
6. Use “honey pots” and/or “honey tokens.”
7. Randomly audit insider computer usage, focused monitoring of individual users, and for critical systems the capability to allow maintenance of a continuous map of selected user’s activity.
8. Perform a rapid and effective audit to detect anomalies in programs and files.
9. Audit user activities associated with each file to ascertain who executes, read, modify or print activities, as well as when and where the activity occurred.

React to an insider’s actions

1. Respond with an alarm or countermeasure.
2. Perform a rapid and effective audit to detect anomalies in programs and files
3. Audit user activities associated with each file to ascertain who executes read, modification or print activities, as well as when and where the activity occurred.
4. Preserve data regarding malicious insider activity throughout the infrastructure.
5. Make accurate copies of hard drives with sufficient rigor to provide the potential use as evidence in criminal or administrative proceedings.


3.1 Any Insider Threat solution installed on DoD systems or networks shall:

1. Provide capability to maintain a working state after a computer network attack has occurred including virus and worm activity.
2. Provide minimum interference with user day-to-day productivity, usability, and functionality.
3. Provide minimum degradation on Central Processing Unit (CPU) performance.
4. Focus primarily on Microsoft Windows (MS) based Operating System (OS) and applications.
5. React to an insider’s actions including the capability to respond with an alarm, countermeasure or escalating alerts as necessary.
6. Protect data regarding malicious insider activity from modification throughout the infrastructure. 
7. Install and deployment on small (500 users) and large-scale networks (up to 40,000 users).

Objective 1 – Provide IV&V services to support USAID IT-related Decision Making Processes. 

This objective requires a contractor that can provide objective assessments of facts relative to defined criteria to support good strategic, tactical and operational management decisions about USAID’s information technology projects and operations.

Objective 2 – Provide Software and System life-cycle IV&V. 

This objective requires a contractor that can conduct IV&V using selected standards to ensure that planning, development, management and support processes are in place and working properly.

The ADS-548 can be accessed on the following site: http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/500/548.pdf

It is the intent of the USAID to compete an IV&V blanket purchase agreement under the General Services Administration IT 70 Schedule Contract using a pre-qualified supplier list.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. Prequalification does not constitute a contract award. It is a business decision of the Contracting Team to pre-qualify. The USAID reserves the right to terminate this process if the needs of the USAID change. Responding to this notice does not guarantee pre-qualification or participation in future USAID activities. USAID is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Sources Sought Notice.

PRE-QUALIFICATION PROCESS

In order to be considered for the pre-qualification process, all interested parties must submit information that addresses the items listed in the Request for Information section of this document.

BACKGROUND

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) was created by executive order in 1961, when President John F. Kennedy signed the Foreign Assistance Act into law.  USAID has been the principal U.S. Agency to extend assistance to countries recovering from disaster, trying to escape poverty, and engaging in democratic reforms.

The mission of USAID is to administer economic assistance programs that assist developing countries to realize their full potential through the development of citizen and democratic societies and the dynamism of free markets and individual initiative.  USAID administers economic assistance by pursuing a strategy of sustainable development.  The strategy is based on aiding the environment; addressing population and health; fostering democracy; and encouraging economic growth.

Information systems play an important role in monitoring and measuring USAID’s progress in implementing its mission.  To this end, USAID leverages information technology resources to support long-term and equitable economic growth and advance U.S. foreign policy objectives by supporting economic growth, agricultural and trade, global health and democracy, conflict and humanitarian assistance.  USAID provides assistance in four regions of the world:  Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and the Near East, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Europe and Eurasia.  With its headquarters in Washington, D.C. USAID has over 80 field offices (Missions) around the world.

USAID’s Information Resources Management and PMO are responsible for the Agency’s information technology projects and programs.  USAID utilizes various contracting vehicles to deliver IT solutions and operating support.  In order to maintain integrity within the IT program, USAID seeks an unbiased and objective source to provide quality assurance through IV&V support services.

In vivo exposure to single anti-cholinesterase pesticides, such as organophosphates and carbamates, is known to depress brain acetylcholinesterase activity as well as swimming and feeding behaviors in fish.  The goal of this project is to determine the effects of mixtures of anti-cholinesterase pesticides on the behavior and neurobiology of juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch).  The pesticides to be used in this study (carbaryl, carbofuran, diazinon, malathion, and chlorpyrifos) are commonly used in agricultural and residential areas, and have been routinely detected in surface waters throughout the state and country.  As identified by NOAA staff, one key data gap in ecological risk assessments is the effect of pesticide mixtures on salmonids.  Therefore, this project may provide essential data to regional staff conducting regional and national scale risk assessments regarding pesticides and listed salmonids. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000

STATEMENT OF WORK

SOLICITATION NUMBER:     RFP517-05-007

Position Title/Grade  Mission Economist/Economic Growth SO Team Leader /GS-14/15

Organizational Location:  General Development Office

Position Title/Grade of Supervisor:  Mission Director/FE-CM

Supervisory Controls:  The incumbent is authorized broad latitude to deal with senior government officials, representatives of international financing institutions, donor representatives, senior U.S. Embassy counterparts, members of the Dominican Government’s National Assembly, local government officials, as well as senior leaders in the non-governmental arena.  Supervision is minimal and the Mission Economist works independently to meet broad objectives.

Introduction: 

USAID Dominican Republic is headquartered in Santo Domingo.  It is responsible for the development and management of the U.S. Government's economic assistance program that is focused on economic opportunities for the poor, democracy and governance, and health of vulnerable populations.  

The Dominican Republic shares a border with Haiti.  Due to its location in the center of the Caribbean corridor used for trafficking narcotics, arms and people, it is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.  With a total population of 8.3 million, the Dominican Republic suffers from weak public institutions, lack of transparency, and a fragile democracy.  On the other hand, a vigorous economy, trade agreements with Central America and CARICOM, and an active civil society open up opportunities for economic and democratic progress in the Dominican Republic that USAID can help to achieve.

The Mission Economist reports to the Mission Director and leads the Economic Opportunities Strategic Objective Team.  The Team is comprised of 6 persons, including the Mission Economist.  The economic growth portfolio includes all USAID activities in economic growth, environment and education.  

The economy of the Dominican Republic has suffered, and continues to suffer, major setbacks.  In May of 2003, the collapse of the Banco International (BanInter), and the collapse of 2 other large financial institutions in the DR, created a $1.2 billion deficit that the GODR was forced to assume.  A100% devaluation in the peso, rampant inflation, and a continuing crisis in the power sector, exacerbates an already difficult condition.  An IMF agreement was reached, then breached, and only recently reinstated, but with qualification.  The combination of the bank crisis, the devaluation, inflation, and the loss of jobs leads economists to believe the DR will experience negative growth this year with only modest prospects for slight recovery in the next two years.  The Mission Economist will advise on policy reform measures during this critical period.

The Dominican Republic recently completed negotiations to enter the Central American Free Trade Agreement.  Implementation of this major new trade agreement will require significant and sustained effort by the Dominican Republic to reform policies and strengthen institutions.  The U.S. government must see that the Dominican Republic’s entry into this vital new trade agreement is as smooth as possible and that the Dominican population receives the maximum benefits from this new agreement.  The Mission Economist will lead this effort

The convergence of the major economic downturn of one of the fastest growing economies in the Caribbean and the advent of the new CAFTA agreement have combined to force major new, and increasingly complex, responsibilities, upon the Mission and therefore upon the Mission Economist.  Reporting on the energy sector, the currency fluctuations, monitoring policy measures for revenue generation, coupled with the reporting requirements and the need to meet and brief representatives from the international financing institutions (the IMF, the IDB, the World Bank) while juggling demands for trade capacity development or analysis of textile quotas under new trade agreements has significantly shifted the complexity of the job as well as the visibility of the senior economic policy advisor, the levels of contacts he has within the GODR and the urgency of the work.  

The Mission Economist is the senior economic policy expert, and is responsible for strategic planning and providing advice on all aspects of economic reform, trade and trade policy.  His extensive reporting and detailed analysis forms the majority of substantive economic situation reporting from the U.S. Embassy. Additionally, the incumbent not only analyses the current and future economic situation in the Dominican Republic but also reports how the DR’s economy affects Haiti.  As Haiti trade perspectives and economic interests change, these too affect the DR economy and trade policies.  Thus, the incumbent is also responsible for advising the Mission on the interrelationship of trade and economic growth as it affects both countries on the island.  In summary, this is a demanding, high visibility, high level position, the principal source of expert information advice and assistance to the USAID Mission on economics, finance and trade.  

Duties and Responsibilities:
 
As the Mission’s Senior Economic Advisor, the Mission Economist provides the Mission Director and senior members of the Country Team expert advice in economics and economic growth, including all aspects of economic policy, trade and trade capacity building, fiscal and monetary reform, export diversification, tourism development, and energy sector reform.  He also serves as Team Leader of USAID/DR’s Economic Opportunities Strategic Objective Team where he has principal responsibility for leading strategic planning, activity design and implementation, and impact monitoring of USAID’s programs to achieve economic growth objectives.  As the senior technical expert within the Mission on trade issues, economic reform and finance, the Mission Economist takes the lead in liaising with senior level public and private sector partners, as well as representatives of international financial institutions (the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, InterAmerican Development Bank).  The Mission Economist is the principal source of expert information, advice and assistance to USAID and frequently to the U.S. Embassy and is responsible for application of high-level knowledge on economic policy reform, advocacy for liberalization of trade, trade issues and free trade agreement negotiations and compliance, and trade capacity building.   Additionally, the Mission Economist is expected to analyze and report upon macroeconomic conditions.  The incumbent provides senior level expert analysis on economic and economic development policy for the General Development Office, for the USAID Mission Director, and for the US Embassy.  She/he provides a full range of consultative, advisory, information-gathering, analytical, and evaluative technical services of broad scope and complexity. 
 
As the Economic Opportunities Strategic Objective Team Leader, the Mission Economist provides leadership on identification of economic policies that sustain growth and impact the poor, including competitiveness, trade, fiscal, public investment, environment and education policies, advocating for reform of these policies as needed, and monitoring and reporting on the impact of reforms undertaken.  He/she designs and implements strategies and mechanisms to solicit and receive feedback on trade issues, economic reform issues, fiscal and or monetary issues from public and private sector leaders and representatives, economists, and other trade experts.  He/she is authorized broad latitude to deal with senior government officials, representatives of international financing institutions, donor representatives, senior U.S. Embassy counterparts, members of the Dominican Government’s National Assembly, local government officials, as well as senior leaders in the non-governmental arena.  The SO Team Leader and Mission Economist thinks and operates strategically and programmatically, analyzing complex situations in order to assist in the development and implementation of USAID strategic plans and programs and in assessing the impact of host country policies and practices on USAID programs. 

He/she establishes, maintains and manages sensitive, high-level relationships with and between national government entities, private sector leaders, non-governmental organizations, other donor agencies and U.S. Mission personnel. S/he is based in Santo Domingo and travels throughout the Dominican Republic and, occasionally, to other countries in the region.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13 (not to exceed $100,000).  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-02. The proposed contract is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561730 and the small business size standard is $6.0 million.  

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) is responsible, in accordance with Executive Order 13112 – Invasive Species, for maintaining ten (10) acres of land for its radar facility site located at SW 137th Avenue and SW 168th Street, Miami, Florida. Since at least 1993, the year the NWS KAMX WSR-88D radar was installed, no management or control of exotic plant and hardwood species has been performed on the site. The purpose of this Request for Quotation (RFQ) is to develop and implement a work plan for the first year of removing and reducing the growth of exotic plant species and non-native hardwoods on the NWS ten acre site.  

Site Background: The NWS site was previously owned by the military and is within an area referenced as the Perrine Limited Training Area (LTA). The site was part of the 2,107 acre Richmond Navel Air Station (NAS Richmond) which was active from 1942 to 1945 and ceased operations following a major hurricane.  In 1960, the U.S. Army acquired about 227.7 acres of the former NAS Richmond. Some of the land was developed, but an area of approximately 136 acres remained undeveloped as the Perrine LTA. On November 26, 2002, the General Services Administration (GSA) transferred 10 acres of the former Perrine LTA to the U.S. Department of Commerce for establishment of a clear zone adjacent the NWS radar site.  

Two federally endangered plant species have been identified on the Perrine LTA, the Deltoid Spurge (Chamaesyce deltoidea ssp. deltoidea) and the Tiny Polygala (Polygala smallii). The property also contains a critically imperiled ecosystem, the Richmond Pine Rocklands, and wet prairie natural areas. In addition to the two endangered plant species identified on the Perrine LTA, for the Richmond Pine Rocklands, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) lists two plant species Crenulate Lead-Plant (Amorpha crenulata) and Small’s Milkpea (Galactia smallii) as endangered, one species Garber’s Spurge (Chamaesyce garberi) as threatened, and 12 species as candidates for listing. Of the twelve species, nine occur in the Richmond Pine Rocklands area where the Perrine LTA is located.

The site presently has medium to high density of exotic plant and hardwood species with the Burma Reed (Neyraudia reynaudiana) and Brazilian Pepper Tree (Schinus terebinthifolius) being the most prevalent. However, the site contains other exotic plant species and non-native hardwoods which need to be treated. Although some areas of the site are disturbed, there is an abundant seed source of native plants in the area to recolonize the treated areas. At this time, no restoration work is planned for re-establishing native plant and hardwood species at the site.       

The former Perrine LTA is bounded on the south by SW 176th Street and the Army Reserve Center. The property is bound to the west by SW 137th Avenue and the same Army Reserve Center. The Federal Bureau of Prisons – Metropolitan Correctional Center borders the property to the north and the Dade Zoological Park borders the property to the east. The site presently has some minor development which includes the NWS radar facility and associated gravel access roadways.  

Work Plan: The purpose of this Request for Quotation (RFQ) is for the Contractor to develop and implement a work plan for the first year of removing and reducing the growth of exotic plant and hardwood species on the NWS owned ten acre site. Development of the work plan requires a visit to the ten acre NOAA site as discussed under “Section 5.0 Scheduled Site Visit.” As a minimum, the work plan shall include:  
A.  A discussion as to how exotic plant and hardwood species will be identified at the site for treatment.  
B.  A discussion as to the method(s) for identifying, marking the location of, and protecting each plant and hardwood species listed as being either endangered, threatened, rare or commercially exploited.  
C.  A discussion as to how exotic plant and hardwood species will be treated (mechanical methods, controlled burn, and/or application of herbicides) at the site.  Minimal use of herbicides is encouraged.  Include a discussion as to which species will be removed from the site for offsite disposal and identify the off-site disposal site(s).   
D.  A list of the equipment which will be used to treat the exotic species at the site.
E.  A list of herbicides, with the manufacturer’s Material Safety Data Sheet (MSD) for each herbicide, which will be used for treatment of the exotic plant and hardwood species.  Include the estimated quantities of each herbicide that will be applied and their potential effect on non-targeted native species should spray-over occur.  Include method(s) which will be utilized to prevent spray-over and runoff of herbicides to adjacent properties.   
F.  A schedule as to when, how many visits, and the anticipated duration of each site visit, within twelve months of the date of contract award, to fully implement the work plan. 
G.  The contractor’s cost to develop and implement the work plan.  The cost shall include all labor, materials, and equipment to perform the work.
H.  A list of qualified contractor personnel who will be identifying exotic and protected plant and hardwood species at the site, and those supervising field site activities.  Include biographies for each qualified personnel performing the work.  Include copies of applicable licenses for personnel who are required under federal, state, or local regulation to maintain licenses in performance of their duties (e.g. herbicide applicator’s license).
I.  Copies of all licenses required to fully implement the work plan (e.g. operate equipment, transport materials, apply herbicides).       

Permits and Record Keeping: The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining all permits for the work and making all notifications, as required, to federal, state and local regulatory agencies prior to performing the work.  After the work is completed, the Contractor shall submit herbicide application records to the NOAA Contracting Officer and maintain records in accordance with the Florida Statutes, Chapter 487.160. 

Scheduled Site Visit: Prior to preparing and submitting a quotation, each Contractor is required to visit the site. Contact  Rusty Pfost, Meteorologist-In-Charge (MIC) of the Miami Weather Forecast Office (WFO), at 305/229-4502 to schedule a site visit.   

Special Field Conditions: A Final Historical Records Review document, prepared by Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. (November 2004), reports that the Perrine LTA was used for limited training activities by the U.S. Army Reserve Command between 1989 and 1999.  Training activities included a field hospital, foot patrol, and wheeled vehicle training with the potential for some blank ammunition training.  During site visits in April and June 2004, several blank small arms cartridges and one spent practice flare were observed.  If encountered, these items pose virtually no safety risk.  Although unlikely, it is possible that unexploded ordnance (UXO), discarded military munitions (DMM), and munitions constituents (MC) may be encountered.  For safety assurance, in the event any of the later items are encountered, the items should not be handled, and the NOAA Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) should be notified.
