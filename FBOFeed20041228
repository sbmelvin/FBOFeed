This acquisition is NOT small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 541690.  It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional support services for the National Information Center on Health Services Research and Health Care Technology (NICHSR) on a sole source basis from the Society for Public Health Education (SOPHE).

The purpose of this agreement is to improve public health by expanding the network of CDCynergy trainers who can teach public health professionals and others to improve the effectiveness of their health communications planning, implementation, and delivery.  The impact of the effort will be increased by supporting the capacity of the newly trained CDCynergy trainers to conduct CDCynergy trainings in their state/local areas and by evaluating the partnership/exchange between health educators and medical librarians who are CDCynergy trainers in their knowledge and use of various health information databases and other electronic resources that can enhance the effectiveness of public health interventions.

NASA/GRC intends to have the above jobs done by HC Starck, 21801 Tungsten Rd., Cleveland, OH 44117, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The justificatiion for lack of competition is that the Government requires pieces of GRCop-84, a developmental copper-based alloy, to be rolled from approximately 2.5" thick x 9.5" long x 24" wide billets into a variety of thicknesses of plate and sheets. All finished plate and sheets are to be at least 21" wide and most will be 24" to 25" wide. HC Starck is the only known company with a mill this wide specifically designed to handle short (9.5" and shorter) pieces without the pieces falling into the gap between the roll and the support table. It is also desireable to avoid the need for extensive testing, and to maintain consistency, to confirm the product rolled is comparable to prior efforts. Failure to do so will not allow completion of the task prior to the end of the fiscal year when the program is to be completed.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m., local time, on January 11,2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (TACOM-ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ intends to procure on a Full and Open Competitive Basis the requirement for the manufacture and delivery of 5.56mm, M862 Short Range Training Cartridges in the following quantity ranges: One Basic Year: 3,800,000 – 5,999,999 each; 6,000,000 – 8,000,000 each. There will be four Option Years. The quantity ranges for Option 1-FY05: 500,000 – 1,600,000 each; 1,600,001 – 2,600,000 each. Option 2-FY 06, Option 3-FY 07, Option 4-FY 08, each option year will have the following ranges:  4,301,507 – 6,145,010 each; 6,145,011 – 7,988,513 each. This cartridge matches the trajectory of standard 5.56mm combat ammunition out to 25 Meters while having a maximum range of no greater than 250 Meters. This allows realistic training at sites where range restrictions prohibit the firing of standard 5.56mm ammunition. The M862 cartridge is used in the M16 family of weapons and requires the use of a modified weapon bolt, (the M2 training bolt) which converts the M16 from a gas-operated weapon to a blowback operation. The cartridge shall conform to the requirements of the M862 Performance Specification. Only those cartridge designs which have previously been qualified by the government in accordance with the M862 performance specification shall be considered. The design must be qualified at the time of proposal submission. The solicitation is anticipated to be available on the internet at http://procnet.pica.army.mil/ on or about 10 January 2005. All proposals should be submitted electronically to: Louisa Meléndez:  melendez@pica.army.mil on or about February 11, 2005, 2:00 PM (EDT).

<DESC>This is  modification 1 to the synopsis entitled Safety and Mission Assurance (S&MA) Support Services Contract and solicitation number NNJ-BJ4-JKC-5-001L which was posted on 16 November 2004.   NASA/JSC solicited information about potential sources for the Safety and Mission Assurance Support Services Contract (S&MA SSC) on November 24, 2003. On March 1, 2004 the Government determined its interest was best served by deferring the S&MA SSC re-competition. This notice is given to allow additional potential offerors an opportunity to submit a capability statement in accordance with the instructions below. Potential offerors that submitted a capability statement as a result of the November 24, 2003 notice are not required to resubmit a capability statement unless the information requested below has changed. Revisions	 should be submitted as an addendum to the original capability statement. In addition, potential sources that submitted a capability statement as a result of the November 24, 2003 notice and would no longer wish to be considered a potential source are asked to notify Cody Corley vie e-mail to remove their names as potential sources.  Selected services associated with this contract are performed at various domestic locations including but not limited to: Sonny Carter Training Facility, Houston, TX; White Sands Test Facility, NM; and other NASA Centers such as Kennedy Space Center, FL; Langley Research Center, VA. Services under this contract also may be performed overseas at such locations as the International Space Station (ISS) Program International Partners.  This potential contract will require overall S&MA support to the Space Shuttle Program, the ISS Program, the Exploration Program, to all Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE) developed at JSC, to both Space Shuttle and ISS-related Extravehicular Activity (EVA) hardware and operations, and to both Shuttle and ISS payloads. The contractor must also support the development and implementation of institutional/industrial safety programs and practices for JSC personnel and facilities. Contemplated requirements will include: compliance with existing and development of new S&MA requirements, standards, and processes; support to design and acceptance reviews for major program and project hardware and software deliverables; and review of program and project S&MA data products/deliverables such as Failure Modes and Effects Analyses/Critical Items Lists (FMEA/CILs), safety data packages and hazard reports, noncompliance reports, waivers, deviations, and exceptions, problem reports, and acceptance data packages. Review of these S&MA deliverables must assure that program requirements are met, that deficiencies or areas of noncompliance are identified, and that appropriate risk analyses have been conducted. The contractor will also be required to perform software assurance and have evidence of a continuous process improvement program. The contractor must also support multiple program boards and panels, represent S&MA in the evaluation of proposed change requests, problem resolutions, hazard report and FMEA/CIL dispositions, and risk assessments. This support includes the analyses necessary to support the certification of flight readiness prior to each launch. The contractor will provide real-time support as required in the JSC Mission Evaluation Room (MER) by reviewing in-flight anomalies and assuring that resolution of anomalies does not violate S&MA requirements and represents a safe course of action for the program(s). The contractor will also review proposed launch commit criteria, crew procedures and flight rules to assure that hazard controls are not violated. The contractor will also be expected to perform system hazard analyses, reliability analyses, maintainability analyses, probabilistic risk analyses, fault tree analyses, risk trades, and effectively use of other S&MA tools and techniques to aid program managers in assessing and understanding risks and risk trade-offs as they apply to programmatic design and operational decisions. The contractor will also perform structural, thermal, dynamic, and kinematic analyses, including assessments of the probability of penetrations from micrometeoroids and orbital debris, the hazards of space radiation, and other risks to the health of crewmembers exposed to the low-Earth orbital environment. The contractor will also be responsible for Quality Assurance functions for all major programs and projects, including Quality Engineering, Procurement Quality Assurance, Government In-Line Assurance, Contract Surveillance, and Software Quality. The contractor shall also provide support to human hazardous test activities at the JSC and support Test Readiness Review Boards to assure that proposed test activities do not compromise subject health or safety. The contractor will also assist the Government in exploring and developing new S&MA tools and techniques, and in evaluating the S&MA implications of new processes, devices, and technologies, such as micro- and nano-fabrication techniques. Contractor personnel must possess extensive knowledge of Shuttle and ISS subsystems and program processes, as well as expertise in the safety, reliability, maintainability, and quality assurance and engineering disciplines.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to highlight the following additional research area.  All other information remains the same.

Command and Control/Gaming Environment:  We seek a range of cost-effective approaches to populate an experimentation environment with different "games" that span a spectrum from manual "board games" to highly automated Massive Multi-player Online Games (MMOGs) or Persistent Virtual Worlds.  The scope includes: Develop new or adapt an existing game engine (develop new only for the simple "board game" application; adopt/adapt existing MMOG/Persistent World games) and Automated games (servers), must run on an affordable infrastructure (e.g., high-end PC workstations) and operate over a typical internet connection, through firewalls.

The focus will be on experimentation with cost-effective, interactive multi-player gaming environments that will serve as the centerpiece for stimulating the exploration of advanced Command & Control (C2) concepts and the innovative use of information technology in support of C2.

Command & Control (C2) is the exercise of authority and direction by a commander over assigned forces in the accomplishment of a mission. Command and control functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications, facilities, and procedures employed by the commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling forces and operations.

The projected outcome of this initiative is to demonstrate the use of the gaming environment in facilitating C2 experimentation and technology evaluation.  The gaming environment will serve to create the context and dynamic stimulus for the functions of C2:  Planning, Directing, Coordinating and Controlling.  We encourage a multidisciplinary collaboration between industry and academia lead teams.  More detailed supplemental information can be obtained from the Technical POC Dr. Barry T. McKinney, 315-330-3730, email: Barry.McKinney@rl.af.mil.

<DESC>The General Services Administration, Heartland Region, Federal Supply Service is contemplating issuing a contract for space redesign.  If you are interested in the solicitation, please complete the survey after reading the following description.

The solicitation will be issued tentatively in March 2005 with a contract issued in April 2005.  This project entails providing Project Management that will include for space design, space planning, inventory analysis of existing furniture and equipment for possible reuse, and furniture specification necessary to house employees of the General Services Administration, Heartland Region, Federal Supply Service, 1500 E. Bannister Road, Kansas City, MO 64131.  A map of the area can be found at the following link:

http://r6insite.gsa.gov/home/content/complex_map.asp

Current situation for building 6:

Building Six is two stories with an elevator, four restrooms and an open stairwell.  The total usable square footage is 16,700 and houses 97 employees and contractors.  The current floor plan has utilized all space for individual work space as well as two conference rooms, a break room, library and four private offices and does not allow for expansion.  

Future needs for building 6:

Fleet Management Division is located currently in building 2 and 3 and will be relocated into shared facilities within Building 6.  Fleet Management Division consists of 24 government and contract associates.  The systems furniture was procured in 1989 and was relocated to their present space in 1993.  The furniture has been fully depreciated and the manufacturer has discontinued this style.  Additional needs are for 750 square feet of Accident Management Center files.  Lastly, building 3 is scheduled for destruction in 2006. 

Property and Traffic Management Division is located in Building 2 and will be relocated into share facilities within Building 6.  Traffic Management houses 14 government and contract associates.  Their systems furniture was procured in 1989 and was relocated to their present space in 1993.  The furniture has been fully depreciated and the manufacturer has discontinued this style.  
Current situation for building 2:

Building 2 consists of 8,300 usable square footage space after Fleet Management Division and Property and Traffic Management Division are relocated.  

Future needs for building 2:

Require that all carpeting be replaced.

GWAC Division, Building 1, Plaza Level, houses ten (10) Government and contract associates and calls for an increase to 22 positions.   Their systems furniture was procured in 2003.  Propose that GWAC will be moved to Building 2.

Regional Marketing, Building 1, Mall Level, houses seven (7) government associates.  Require a publication and meeting room.  Their systems furniture was procured in 2000. Propose the Regional marketing program be relocated in Building 2. 

The Federal Supply Service has two UNISYS computer programmers that need to be relocated out of the Regional Computer Room.  It is proposed they move into a secured walled office in Building 2.  

Currently, there is a Federal Supply Service 480 square foot conference room in building 2 and lacks the IT communication equipment necessary to meet the needs of our service.  It is proposed to utilize that space to acquire a state of the Art Conference Room capable of sitting 40+ personnel in one conference room.

Other Considerations:

Building 1, Mall Level, houses 25 Government and contract associates.  The total usable square footage is 10,670 square feet and they lack an adequate size conference room or efficient realignment of personnel to meet a 3-5 year anticipated business line expansion.  Their systems furniture was purchased in 2001.  Carpeting in this area requires replacement.  Propose the CFMH remain in the Mall Level and the workstations and conference room be redesigned.

Market Survey Questions:

1)  As a minimum, what skill level categories would be required to accomplish this task?  








2) Is there an industry standard used to approximate a cost for such a move, (example-a standard cost per square foot for estimation)?





3) Is it standard industry practice for one or more firms to complete the entire job?







4) What is your commercial delivery time for these items? 

	

5)  Based on the current projection of issuing the solicitation with award of a task order in April 2005.  Can the project be completed by January 2006?  Why or Why Not?  Or does it require the work to be phased?







6) Do you see anything that might cause a problem for you in quoting on this proposed acquisition as stated?

  



7) Have you done this type of work previously for the U.S. Government?  If so, which Agencies?





8)  Is site visit critical?

<DESC>The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended to respond to a technical comment submitted.

The due date for quotations, Thursday, December 30, 2004 at 3:00 PM Local Time remains unchanged.

COMMENT:  The recent NIST solicitation for Spectroscopic Portal Monitors states that only neutron detectors that utilize He-3 elements will be accepted for consideration in this solicitation.  The modification of this solicitation announced in the FBO Daily December 25, 2004 FBO #1125 did not the alter the stipulation that He-3 detectors be utilized for the portal monitors that shall be utilized by NIST for evaluating the testing parameters for the proposed ANSI N42.38 standard.

We feel that limiting this solicitation to only He-3 detectors for neutron detection negates a number of well developed and understood detector technologies. We also believe that the condition that He-3 solely be used for evaluating the ability of a detector system to meet the proposed testing criteria for ANSI N42.38 restricts the type of neutron detection technologies to be utilized or which will be considered for use in spectroscopic portal monitors.

We request that this NIST Solicitation be modified to allow for other neutron detection technologies to be utilized in the portal monitors.  We feel quite strongly on this point.

RESPONSE:  At this time NIST needs to have all He-3 detectors so we can compare the performance for the same type of detector. In the future, NIST will purchase different types of instruments.  NIST understands that there are other technologies and they do work, but, at this point in time, due the type of test we want to perform NIST needs all the monitors to have He-3 detectors.
